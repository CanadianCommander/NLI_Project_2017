today , specialization on a specific academic subject is a must for most of the researchers .where innovations need different appoaches to the problem , most of the research work carried out today requires improvements on the previous results .having a broad knowledge on a specific topic is not enough to improve an existing research , even to do innovations .instead , science makes harder to specialize where it eases to access knowledge .improvements and innovations in science pushes people to specialize on certain topics rather than having the broad knowledge on seperate topics .new innovations , improvements require more and more specialization on the studied topic since the research area divides into sub-areas .for example , the first computer was made by electronical engineers while the future improvements lead to a new academic area called `` computer science  .at this point , no generic improvements can made on this area , because it is already divided into several sub-areas like networking , computer vision , algorithms , etc .these sub-areas are also dividing into sub-areas , like wireless networking , leading to the constant specialization on the certain area .specialization on a specific area lets researchers to concentrate on the subject that they are researching on , making unnecessary parts unavaliable .in the early times of computers , programming and electronical engineering were closely related and most of the research is carried on by the people with the electronics background .but with the improvements on the technology , programming and electronics begin to split up .today , there is still related subjects which brings computer scientists and electronical engineers together , but today for most of the people working on the electronics field , programming is not a `` must  if they research on computers .in today s world , information is widely accessible with technologies used like world wide web ( www ) .in the old times , accessing knowledge was hard because of using books , connection problems and distances between researchers from different cities or countries .today s technology allows everyone to access knowledge and have it .so this forces people to specialize on topics instead of having broad information alone .specialization on certain academic subjects increased the opportunity to improve previous work and innovate .having only the broad information is not enough for future tech .
