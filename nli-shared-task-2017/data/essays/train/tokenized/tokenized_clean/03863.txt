everyone during his lifetime has to `` face youth  .many people thinks that during this life period one lives the best moments ever .it is difficult to give an opinion , but i think that in most cases it is true : young people enjoy life more than older people do .first of all one has to think about the great freedom that a young person has .when you are young ( i am thinking about teenagers and people around 20 years old ) you often have `` many rights  and not so many obligations .let s think about the freetime and the money : a young person can spend his freetime and his money how he wants to .he does nt have to mantain a family or pay for the house s rental .so he can spend his money to get the more fun he can .an older person , instead , has to take care of his family , spend money for the house , the car and many other stuffs that are necessary .second : to work is often more boring than to study .when one goes to school or to the university he learns everyday something new : this is funny .instead a worker in his job often has to `` repeat  the same actions .there is also another important thing to be considered .a young person usually looks with more happiness to his life than an older one .a young person has much more time to live than an older one : a young person is able to make projects for his future and he is able to change them very often .this is not easily possible for and old person .for last .a young person lives many of his everyday experiences as `` first time experiences  .the first time one lives a situation usually is the one which gives him more feelings , sensations .something that for an older person could be `` usual  ; maybe for a young person is not .let s think about the first love , for example .of course there are many benefits of being old ( you have experience , you know `` how to live  ) but i think that the most beautiful part of our lifetime is youth .
