i agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas that it is to learn pure facts .i have several reasons supporting my opinion on this topic .firstly , today nearly all facts are available anywhere at anytime .so the importance of learing facts is weakening .instead the time coul ; d be used more sensefull getting concepts .for instance , it is possible for a history class student to get nearly all historical figures he needs in the internet .there he can get them all day long , and with the help of mobile computing nearly everywhere .secondly , concepts are very important to learn , because you need them in order to create own ideas and concepts .facts do not help much with that .for instance in my job as a controller i do not only have to know how some special figures , for instance the return on investment or the earnings of one year have to be calculated , but in order to improve our controlling instruments , i have to figure ot new figures .to do this , i need to know how to create them .i need to know which numbers would me of use to our management .to create new figures it is also necessary to have a general idea of mathmetical concepts .these can not be learned by heard , but have to be understood .once understood , i am able to apply these concepts to work on new ideas .thirdly , for high developped countries it is very important to be faster in developmet than for instance the fast developping countries in asia .they are able to copy our industry products very fast after they have been developped by us .therefore we need to be faster in generating new products , new ideas and new technologies .you do not learn to create those new technologies by learning facts .it is only possible to learn creating them by learning concepts and ideas .in my point it is really important to understand concepts and less important to learn pure facts .this is because in future it will become more and more important to be creative and inventive .in order to achieve this , it is highly appreciative to have well educated , creative employees .
