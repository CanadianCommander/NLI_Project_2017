along with changes in generations , induviuals beliefs , thoughts , and reasoning changes .i have seen generations right from my great grand mothers age down to my little sister .for me the defination of enjoyment holds a lot of significance .enjoyment according to me is a state in which an induviual attains `` ultimate happiness  in what ever he or she is performing .i completely disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .to say that young people do not enjoy life comparitively is false and incorrect .if the defination of enjoyment remains stationary , then so does its impact on peoples life .the only difference arises in th eway people percieve and interpret it to be .enjoying and relishing life to the fullest can be accomplished in several different methods .to enjoy life one doe not have to be of any particular age limit .my sister often asks my grandmother to go and enjoy her life and not sit in front of the television box the whole day and eat .but my grandmother often tells her that for her the television and food is her ultimate sense of enjoyment .for my sister to party and go out everyday with her friends is her source of entertainment and enjoyment but for someone whose old may look at it in a different way .they may say that this girl is spoilt she goes out everyday , but that is her sense of enjoyment .the difference clearly lies in the way people interpret it .but according to me my grand mother is enjoying her life as much as my sister is and she loves her life to be the way it is .by watching television it does not make her inferior , she recieves as much as joy and happiness as my sister does by going out and partying .there is no consise defination of enjoyment my grandmother is expressing the ultimate sense of happiness she sachieves by doing teh deeds above which is basically her defination of enjoyment .yes , the generations have changed , technology and science have advanced a lot into this modern world of ours .but emotions , feeling and the ways to express it have all remained the same .it is important that the young generation begins to value and respect the emotions and the methods of expressing them from the older generations .
