i belive the young people enjoy life more than older people , because young people always thinks that there are in the begining of there life and they have a long life in the future .on the other hand we have the older people who thinks that there life will end soon .another reason that i think why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do not have the experience of life , so everything they do is interstinting and new to them .but for older people they went into a lot of situations and problems , so they gain a lot of experience and when thaey go threw it again , they will think it is boaring and old .young people are always active and looking for some new and enojoyable adventures .older people do not like to chanege there situations and want to keep the same old stuff .whenever the person is young and healthy he has more ability to enjoy what he is doing , and whenever he start getting old he start losing these abilities .young peole always look and search for thare fun , so they can enjoy there life before getting old .when you ask an old person about his long life he will always mention the enjoyable times that he had when he was younger , and he will love to start doing it from the begining .young people are easier to have fun and enjoy life than older people .at the end i belive that young people is easier to make them enjoy life than older peole
