i think the issue posed here is actually a combination of two extremes .the very purpouse of all the human activities is the quest for knowledge .right from the ancient times , man s quest for knowledge has taken him to many ` until-then-undiscovered  realms of priceless information or knowledge .so `` knowledge  as the word indicates can be interpreted as knowing till the edge .but gathering information or collecting details of every aspect and working of this world is no less than a ` herculean  task .every person has a particular field of interest or an area of interest where in , the more he studies about it the more he enjoys .so one can explore joy in knowing more about what he likes or what interests him .this is nothing but specialisation .it actually satisfies the inner desire of a person to know more about the thing or concept he likes to its completeness .on the other hand , having a deep understanding of only one subject or one concept without knowing anything about the other areas might cripple a person in this ` oh-so-tough  competitive world .every person has to have a basic knowledge about vast subject areas and fields .lets take a simple example of a modern day science professor .lets say that he teaches physics to the fullest he knows and surprisingly if he hates the subject mathematics he might be losing the race over the others .because .mathematics is the language in which physical principles are expressed and if he does not keep his mind open to the new theories or principles being invented or discovered in the area of mathematics he will be missing a chance to express his physical principles in a more effective way to the students .so having a broad knowledge of many subject areas than specialize in one subject will definitely give an edge to every person in todays world .` knowledge is wealth and it is good to have many varieties of wealth
