some people know a lot about advertising and so they can imagine that companys have to present their goods as perfect as possible .these kind of people antizipate this behavior and know that not everything told in adverts in true .to this people this statement might be wrong .but i personally agree with this state because you can not suppose that a lot of peole know enough about the taktics of advertising .one reason why products seem to be better is that the companys compete with other goods on marked and need to show that their product is better than the other ones .this is only possible if they tell and show things obut the good wich might be not true .for example if you take a look at the red bull advertising zou see that they say if someone drinks red bull , he will become wings and can fly .an other reason is that companys have to show the consumers why they should by something or why they need that good .once again they have to create a situation in in their advertisements which presents products in the perfect cause .an example for that are the axe advertisements .they show you that a man who does not use their product can t get women and men who do use axe will do much better .i think an other important reason for supporting this statement is that products usually are shown bigger and nicer than in reallity .imagine a picture of a new burger at mc donnalds .the seem to be so big on the advertises and this causes you to go and try one .but if zou have one of those new burgers in your hand you don t recognise the burger from the picture .so altogether i agree with this statement and this causes me to think about this problem before i by something new .
