i beleive that , it is only people who will to take risk would become sucessful .once a person is sucessful he would always want to increse his popularity by trying out new things .he would never want his business or company to be stagnant .in todays competitive world , people are paid for their creativity and creativity is nothing but trying or finding new ways and things .first of all let us consider the field of acting .a moviestar would become sucessful because of a particular kind of role .for example shah rukh khan , became popular for the role of a lover .but he doesnt portray the same role in all his movies .he has acted as a villian , an action hereo etc , and still he is the number one hero in india .his sucess in the role of a lover boy did not constrain him from trying other roles .infact he is one of the most versatile actors in india .let us take up industries as another example .a company would become sucessful for a particular produt say a chocolate .the people of the company would not stop at this point by selling only their popular product .instead they would try to venture other areas like ice creams or even soap or shampoo .carrying out the same technique may always not lead to sucess as many other people could have copied the same technique .well it is always safe to carry out things the way one already knows and there may be no fear of loss or failurewhile taking a new way may end up in a problem .i feel it is better to take risks and enjoy the sucess it brings .thus taking risk and trying out new ways has its own advantages and disadvantages , one needs to be daring enough to take the risk .
