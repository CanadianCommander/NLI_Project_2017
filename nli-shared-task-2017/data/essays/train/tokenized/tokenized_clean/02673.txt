for young people , life seems not to end .they live their lives so fast that old people ca nt .there are lots of things and options for them to do , lots of chices to make .but for old people , lots have been lived and done , it s like time passes slower than normal .children are filled with lots of energy that they can spend .they run , they fight , they even do so weird things that many of us ca nt even imagine .this can be seen on almost all the young people .having lots of energy and the state of having little responsibilities causes the young people to live their lives so fast and funny .when i was young , i never thought that i would come to an age of 30 .i had no responsibilites other than studying for the exams in school .so i had lots of time to do lots of things and had so much fun .i enjoyed all parts of my life until my age of 30 which i am at now .but when i think about my future , i usually feel depressed and a little bit hopeless , because while enjoying life i seem to miss some serious points in my life like having a serious job or marrying with a nice girl .as poeple grow older , they tend to think more about their future or care about the people they love .they begin to spend their time on these .so the funny and enjoyable part of their lives slowly fades and they face the other side of the coin .does this mean that older people miss the enjoyable part of the life ?i guess not . ..but considering the younger people , i can say it is getting rare .
