i strongly believe that the youth of today is committed to help their communities .even in today s competitive world , we see numerous examples where the young people take out substantial time from their busy schedule for their communities  help .first , let us address the concept of community ?the term ` community  can be defined as a group of people , organisations or cultures that are motivated by a common manifesto .let us take 3 different examples to support the claim made above .the concept of ` national social service  or nss is quite old in india .it is a community of college going student volunteers that reaches to the under-privileged sections of their respective communities to ensure their upliftment .in a recently concluded survey on its efficacy , it was heartening to note that 68 % of those asked were already a part of this service and had made on an average 15 visits in the last 4 months to various places .and another 86 % were willing to help raise old clothes and stuff that would be useful for the poor .another example is that of the religious sects .the youth today has ensured that they celebrate their religious functions with their utmost fervor .this ensures that the religious principles are upheld which are so necessary for the spiritual well-being of a community .in the recently concluded ` navratri  , one of the biggest hindu celebrations in india , the youth was at its energetic best .across places , beautiful and decorative sculptures of gods were made for the people to worship .different groups of young people helped raise funds for the functions in their respective areas .after the recent ` mumbai blasts  on 11th july , there has been a new committment on part of the youth .efforts to increase awareness amongst their communities are going on .mumbai saw a huge rally of around 20,000 college students to appeal for communal harmony on the next day of the blasts .this was followed by a huge movement throughout india where the students formed groups and volunteered to distribute pamphlets about the ways to improve the awareness and internal security .numerous students came forward during incidents like gujarat earthquake , kargil war , bihar floods , etc. and even in the rehabilitation process which took very long .thus the 3 examples above depict how the young people nowadays help in the economic , spiritual and social well-being of their communities .
