i agree to the statement that in twenty years tere will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i can support my statement with few explainations or reasons and examples .i strongly believe that people use cars as their means of journey instead of taains and buses .i believe that people would prefer for personal , sophisticated and joyful journey .all this is possible only by having personal cars .let me explain with a reasonable reason .people work through out the day .during weekends they feel to have ecstacy or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin jobs donre by them trough out the week .so they may spend their leisure time with their parents or friends .when it comes to spend time with friends or siblings than they surely prefer to hav long rides or long journeys .so the best way is to have a personal car .because if an individual go for tain or bus as hios means of travelling than he or she has to wait for the train or bus until it comes and he or she can visit only those places where the bus or train can go .he or she can not enjoy the pleasure that the nature gives .but when an individual has got a personal car than he or she can go to any beautiful corners of the nature .there is one more advantage .whenever an individual gets exhausted through his journey than he can stop somewhere and relax for a while and can visit any mani restaurents nearby to have some stuff .is int advantageous ?ofcourse it is .we can have lot of privacy in our own personal cars .finally one damn advantage by having a personal car is we can reach our destiny in time instead of wasting time in wating .the destiny may be anything like office or a party etc .so if we are a bit cautious in driving than personal cars are more advantageous and i conclude that in the coming years everybody prefer cars .
