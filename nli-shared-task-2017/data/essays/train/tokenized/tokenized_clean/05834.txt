some people may believe that there will be more car in use in futhre , but i disagree .i ca nt imagine that there have enough space and streets can be used for more cars .first because the traffic jam are more and more common in nowadays .so many cars in our country can not be used efficently because there are lots of traffic jams in every street at early moning 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 .in work hours , i only need to spent 20 minutes to get school from my appartment , but it s taken nearly 90minutes in rush hours .it s a waste of time .a lot of friends of mine told me that , they would not going to buy any car because ther is nt enough roads can be use for solve the traffic problem .second , there are more and more pollutions made by cars .when i was 6 , i could always see lots of stars in every evening sky .but i can not see them recently , becanse the pollutions are to heavy to cover the sky .the smokes that seeked by the cars are making a lot of pullutions in the air .and it s seemed so harmful to our heathy .third , the price of the oil incressed a lot , that made many people did nt want to buy a car .i alwanys saw so many cars only parked in the parking space that are did nt drive in .and when i asked a owner why he did nt drive his car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive his car for 2 years can buy another car .that seems like we must spend as much or more mony we buy the car to buy the oil .taken the above reasons into account , i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .not only more cars mean more spaces will be taken , also means few pollutions and lots bebefits for our heathy .
