yes most and many advertisements make products much better than they really are .i believe making advertisements it is what a company do to make money , to have success .there is many sports shoes company out in the market right now , but do you really think a pair nike shoes coasts $ 110 .but if you look into it , why a pair shoes coasts so much , because is a advertisment so nike make their shoes look better than everyone else s .at the end of each day , what the company really want , they want to have success , they want to be on the top , that want to make money and they would do what ever they can to get to the top .yes , i agree that most advertisements make products seen much better than they really are .a pair nike shoes do nt really coast $ 110 , they coast something like $ 5 to $ 10 .on top of all the taxes , import , export .it come out somewhere around $ 80 .and then , the bussiness wants to make money so , they add another $ 30 on there , it come out $ 110 .what kind of advertisements nike use there .they make the shoes very expensive , it make the shoes look longlasting , better , or can make you go faster or jump further .the price convience you is a pair good shoes .if a pair shoes come in $ 10 , you would first think , wow it is cheap , but then you would question how long the shoes will last , and why they made it so cheap .you see what advertisements did there , because is so expensive that it convience you that is a pair of good shoes .there is lots competition out there between company and company .they all want one thing , and that is make money .their products could be the same , but the differences is judge what kind or type of advertisements did the company made .a good advertisements can put you ahead of the game and a bad one might just screw you over .so that is why when you watach on tv , there is famous people advertis for the company , hope you would want to but them .they are all doing one thing , to beat their competition .you do nt start a company and hope the company will faile .you want to have success .you want to be on the top .and i believe that is why companies focus on advertisements so much , because once you get to certain level , everyone s products are the same , they only differences will be who done the extra work .advertisements is an extra work , and this extra work and bring your company to the top .i agree with advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .but company have to do advertisment , that is the only way they can beat their competitions and have success .
