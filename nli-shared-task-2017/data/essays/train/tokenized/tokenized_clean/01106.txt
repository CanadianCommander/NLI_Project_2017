i disagree with this opinion which says that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are because , in my opinion , it depends on people how to be impressed by advetisments , and general company do nt do such a thing unless it s a fraud .we should nt say that most advertisments telling a lie .first , how the advertisments influence you would change depending on what situation you are .for , instance , if you see the advertisment of the restaurant when you are hungly , it would more affect you ; however , if you are not , it does nt impress you much .therefore , advirtisments  effectiveness is changing always .second , now it s guaranteeed to send the products back to the company after you bought them .usually , the company takes care of the cost of returning .if the companies tell a lie at the advertisment , it just hart themselves .therefore , the companies would nt tell a lie at the advertisments because they know telling a lie at the advertisment does nt benefit the companies at all .finally , now in this global society , some low prohibits to advertise the products not as they really are .after the internet was created , we have been getting some chances to buy some on the internet .if we go to the store and see what the one really is , we wo nt take any mistakes .however , if we buy them from the internet without seeing the real product , we only can see and imagine the advertisment and the picture of it .new therefore , in order to prevent costomer doing this the new low are being created in many countries .it is clear that advertisments do nt , make a products look better .advertisments ca nt have its definition because it s a just image of the products which can be changed by each costomers .from these reasons , i strongly disagree the opinion which most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
