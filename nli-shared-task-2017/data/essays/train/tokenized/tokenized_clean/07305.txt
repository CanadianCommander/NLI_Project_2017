i do nt agree with this statement .i think people can enjoy life no matter how old they are .i also think a person can feel miserable no matter they were young or old .the reason people enjoy life has nothing to do with there age but is caused by other external factors and circumstances .one factor that helps most people to enjoy life is being around the people they love .this means that an old lady could enjoy life by being around her grandchildren .it also means , that a young boy can feel miserable and unhappy when he is living away from his parents and friends .another factor which causes people to enjoy life is health .people in good health usually enjoy life more than other sick people .this means , that an eighty years old man who is in an excellent health condition is most probably enjoying life more than a sick eight year old boy .never the less , i believe that financial security help people to enjoy life .richer people usually has more means to enjoy life than poorer people .this might sound shallow , but no one can deny that it is true .this means that a very old billionaire can enjoy his life as he can use his money to do fun activities like travel .at the same time , a young poor man may not be enjoying his life as he doesnt have the means to have any luxury .in the end , i would like to stress how i do nt think age affects how much people enjoy life .i think you can enjoy life wheather you were young or old ; however i believe there are other things which help some people enjoy life such as good health , money and being around the people you love .
