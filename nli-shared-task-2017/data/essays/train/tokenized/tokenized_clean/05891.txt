in my opinion successful people are more related in trying new things but they are not necessarily more atraccted in taking risks .the reason for my thought is that people who are successful normaly lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business .therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm .for example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new , lets say , a new car .the car works with a new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested good yet and will probably not make much money .in my opinion the business leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest .because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed .nevertheless i think that successfull people are more willing to try new things .they probably develop new things and also give impulses for future .that means that they are pre - thinkers of future ideas .in spite of my opinion i could imagine that there are successful people who take risks .these people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care of the people who depend on their decisions .another topic to talk is the possibility to take risks in there free time , like a hobby .when something worse happens they will just be risponsable for themselves , expect they have children and wife .in conclusion i would say that successfull people tend to be more risk loving than others but they should be aware of their responsibility .
