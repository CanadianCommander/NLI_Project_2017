i agree to the statement that young people do not have enough time to help out their communities .there are many reasons attached to this statement .the modern world has become very busy and commercial .people work for time , the more time they work the more they are paid , this is directly proportional .let us start the discussion from root level .at a very tender age children are sent to the schools , where they go in the morning and come back in the evening .slowly the student gets habituated to living that his / her parents show .when they finish their metriculation they are joined in higher studies and this goes on for five to six years .after his completion of the graduation he is placed in any big company or in any field that he is interested in .from the above metioned data it clear that the people do not get enough time to their personal time for the community .most of the young people work for the multi national companies which do not provide you the time to spare for extra curricular activities .the people of this generation have become workaholic .no body cares for the society .they do their things money oriented which for them is the primary thing .people of this generation think that there is governmant to look after the things about the community .but they do not understand the simple fact that `` team work means more we and less me  .there are very few people who you can count on your fingers who care for the society and their community .it is because of these people that the world is still alive .the young generation has become more family oriented and care least for their community .i here by conclude my discussion that the corporate culture has slowly but surely imbibed into every one of us which has given less chance to serve their community .i sincerely hope that people would realise the fact that every body should live happily .this only happens when you serve your community atleast inch to its success .
