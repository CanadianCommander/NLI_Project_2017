i agree the statement of `` young peple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i would like to explain the reasons of my thought in the following passage .in my home town , there is an event for cleaning up the river in the town every year .parents usually join to such annual event .and they always complain us that more and more young people should join to the event , because they are also responsible for such task by using their river .the young people are more powerful than the elder people , so their join would be helpful .but the young people , including me , are not willing to join such event .one of the reaseon why they are not in such event is that there are no disadvantage or punishment for not to join to such event .if there are some disadvanteges in such attitudes , it is most likely for young people to join such event .this is because they do not think that giving their time to helping their communities are their duties or obligations .young people are less depend on their communities , because social system for helping all the people in our country has been introduced so they are not required their communities s help .so they do not want to wast their time for the communities .the young people today is busier than those of the past .the business world today is very rapid and young people today in such world are required to spend almost their all time for doing their own business .so it is very likely to that young people today do not have enough time to share time to helping their communities .from the factors and reasons above , young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities .
