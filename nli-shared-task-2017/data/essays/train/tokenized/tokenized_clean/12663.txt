every year , companies around the globe spend millions of dollars advertising their products to the general public .advertisments can be found everywhere from banners on the street to interuptions of your favorite soap operas .when advertising their products , companies tend to advertise their products through the use of celebrities and models sporting their products .everything is played out in a best case scenario .in reality , none of the advertised products live up to their expectations .for example , a shampoo commercial for herbal essences would show a beautiful girl with a great smile and naturally straight hair .the public fails to see that the company is using `` sex  to advertise their commercial .in other scenarios , a coca cola commercial on tv would show a man and his best friends drinking the cold beverage and having a great time .this misleads many customers to thinking that coca cola brings people together allowing them to have a great time that will put permanent smiles on their faces .imagine a world where commercials would advertise everything as it really was .not surprisingly , companies would go bankrupt .looking at the situation from an individual s point of view that swims , none of the shampoo commercials ever live up to their expectation .frizzled hair and split ends are a permanent physical feature .crest extra whitening toothpaste is advertised by people with beautiful smiles and recently whitened teeth , right out of the dentist s office .no toothpaste has ever given the general public smiles as white as the ones seen on advertisments .recently , a ford commercial has been showing on tv where a couple had just bought a new f-150 and because of its immense size , they mentioned that their bachelor party would be celebrated in that car .many companies reach out to their customers through humor , but that never thoroughly describes the true features of their product .all in all , commercials are misleading and if everything was as perfect as it proved to be on tv , then everyone would be living a perfect world .there is always a catch to everything .
