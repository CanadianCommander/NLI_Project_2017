i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do nt give enough time to helping their communities .rather , young people today are a dynamic force bringing change to the communities and nations they live in , especially here in south korea .first , young people involved in the community have transformed politics , most notably in the 2003 presidential election .second , youth are playing a major role in jeju island , helping to get the island recognized as a unesco world cultural heritage site .third , young koreans are helping the nation in it s geographical naming dispute with japan .for these reasons , it s not accurate to say that the young generation is nt involved in the community .young people have brought the winds of change to politics in south korea .in the 2003 presidential election , conservative lee hoi-chang was poised to win the election , leading in all the newspaper polls .young people , whose voter turnout had traditionally been quite weak , supported the progressive candidate roh moo-hyun while the older generation supported lee .the old generation also had higher voter participation , so lee was considered a shoe-in by many .however , 2 weeks before election day , mostly 20 - and 30-something campaign activists for roh moo-hyun campaigned for free in many local communities throughout the country .the decisive factor was the young generations  use of the internet to bring far-flung communities together online .the result was a come-from-behind victory for pres .roh moo hyun .this never would have been possible without the work of youth politically involved in the community .second , youth in jeju island , south korea are the vanguard of the environmental movement there .in 2002 , jeju island was designated as a unesco biosphere reserve because of the uniqueness of halla mountain , the highest peak in south korea .this designation came about due to a signature campaign conducted by the jeju federation for the environment , a quasi-student organization run by youth .also , the same young people are pushing to have jeju island recognized as a unesco world cultural heritage site in 2007 .these youth are having a huge effect on jeju island , helping it to become more internationally-known .finally , youth in korea are helping a large community , the nation of korea , in its dispute with japan over the naming of the east sea/sea of japan .up until the mid - to late-1990 s , no one in the world ever questioned the naming of the sea to the east of korea , also known as the sea of japan .japan unilaterally named the ocean between korea and japan during its colonial occupation of korea in the early 20th century .however , thanks to the efforts of students and youth , this name began to be challenged .students participated in an internet campaign to lobby officials of international geographical naming societies to reconsider the name ` sea of japan .because of the overwhelming response from koreans , mostly the young , the international geographical naming body changed the name from sea of japan to east sea/sea of japan on nautical navigation charts .this would never have been possible were it not for the efforts of korean youth in the international and national community .there are some who underestimate the participation of youth in their communities , but the reality is that youth are having a major impact on their communities through political , environmental , and international activities .youth are important members as well as future inheritors of their communities .
