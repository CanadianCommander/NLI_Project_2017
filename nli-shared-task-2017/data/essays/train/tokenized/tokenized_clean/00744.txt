over the time , technology has always tend to improve .it is human nature to improve and become better .even the greeks believed that ; as an example , chronos , cut his father uranus genitals ; the son would always defeat his father in some sort of way .cars present to society as an issue to be discussed .in fact , cars have been discussed already and are changing as i am writing .different asian companies such as honda , or nissan have already developed a hybrid car .this car is based on a mixture of electric power and fossil fuel or commonly known as gas .this only represents a change along the car product and not just on the industry as a whole .however , this represents the beginning of the cars death .technology has changed massively over time .type writters have been replaced by computers , in a matter of 30 years .computers would also be replaced in some sort of way in the future .cars would also be replaced by different methods of transportation that are more friendly to our globe .the earth is everyones house and therefore it must be clean and taken care of .cars represent a threat for this and therefore they will dissapear .it is only a matter of time .people are starting to be more concerned about the enviroment .finally some common sense is shown by the population of the world when a newspaper showed that the ozone layer had increased its area over the last year .this news would follow the partial abolishement of cars as a way of transportation .countries like switzerland , using electric buses show concerns about it .cars however , would not be able to dissapear totally .there would always be someone who would have a car .however , the rate of cars per country would massively decrease during the next 20 years .again the companies stated above are already thinking about diversification and even massive producers of cars such as ford or general motors are making huge amounts of losses for this last quartiles .it should therefore be concluded , that it is only a matter of time for cars to decrease in number .the enviroment would finally take over car pollution over the next years .countries would also agree and help citizens improving methods of transportation and new companies would come out with new goods that would substitute cars .
