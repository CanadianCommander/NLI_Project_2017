somebody thinks that learn something besides his or her specific subject is kind of wasting time and energy .however , if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it will allow a better understanding of your specialty .a broad knowledge can also help you if you unfortunately meet with accidents .furthermore , it gives you more topics to talk with friends .with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you can do better in your specialty .i believe everybody knows sherock holmes , a famous dectective .what made him the greatest dectective in the world ever ?a broad knowledge .holmes is an expert in violin .he has also achieved great success in chemistry .what s more , he has several books published on the how to raise bees .it is the large amount of knowledge in all the subjects that made him a distinguished dectective .i remembered in the case that several people died after they have gone to swim in a small lake , holmes used his biology knowledge to solve it .it turned out that there was a rather rare poisonous jellyfish in that lake .if he had put all the efforts on his specific subject , maybe he would not be able to solve it .when meeting with accidents , a specific knowledge may not offer much help .let us assume that poor david met with a leg fracture .if he specializes in chemistry and nothing else , he might sit there , crying .however , if david has some knowledge besides chemistry , he might know to place some ice on the injured leg .what s more , a broad knowlege gives you many topics among your friends .almost no one likes to hear a professional talk on the development on brass .however , nearly everyone fancies a talk on the history of opera .more topics among friends , do better in your specialty , and know how to do if met with a accident , a broad knowledge of many subjects is definitely better than merely specialize in one subject .
