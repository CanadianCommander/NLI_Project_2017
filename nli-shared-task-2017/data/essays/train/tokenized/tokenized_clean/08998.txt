many people have asserted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .although this topic can be reject from some skin-deep reasons , it is a topic which is hard to answer due to its complexity .in my opinion , i strongly agree this statement .there are several resons .first of all , most of young people spent their time on studying , playing and excerising .moreover , those activities have obivious effect on their future life .that s why most of teenagers and men do nt want to spent time to helping their communities .they think they ca nt get any profit from this action .in my hometown , students only help their neighborhood when their schools ask them to do that .second , some adults think that , it is very dangerous for kids to clean or to help the community .we can read and see many bad news like murder or violent behavior happend in our society every day .according to this reason , we seldom see our teenagers and kids help their neighborhood .there is a report says that , only three percent of the kids in my country have done such of work .third , there are many workers help us to clean our communities .that is common scene in my hometown because our government has already hired them to do that from a long time ago .so , young people do nt have to do heavy work , and they may be lack of motion to do so .by the way , young people also lack of efficiency on doing such of work like cleaning or protecing their community because they wo nt get any payment from their hardwork .of course , some people who disagree with my opinions also have their own reasons .however , i m very confident that my reasons are more important and indeed .
