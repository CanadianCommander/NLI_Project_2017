in the past fifty years , the number of cars has continuously exploded as the need to move away from where one lives has made itself clear .such a dynamic has lead to an exhaustion of the oil ressources that will be effective in a few years from now .the continuous development of asian and african countries unvariably goes along with a grow in their number of cars , making their gas consumption ever increasing , while the western countries  keeps still .such an increase will ultimatly lead to the depletion of the energy that has kept them running until now : oil .that depletion will lead to the reduction and ultimately to the extinction of the cars as they now exist , being ran on gas .a total disapperance of the means of transportation on long distances would lead to the destruction of the western economy system which is not tolerated by those countries .the rarification of oil has already led scientists to seeking new energies .these so called `` green energies  have to be available on a very large scale , storable and usable to run a car , without having any long term effect on nature , and having to be as safe as possible .for the moment , chimical batteries have shown their limits as to how long they allow a car to be used before reloading the battery .the hydrogen battery that is for the moment the best shot for engine propulsion is still not effective enough and to dangerous for the users in case of a car crash .for the moment , no viable solution has been commercialised on the market , and there is no knowing whether or not the solution will be found in the years to come .but what is for sure is that once the signs of the real disappearance of oil are clear to every country , every one will seek solution that can support their economy , for their economy allows them to live .so in twenty years time , the number of cars will not be lower than today , but higher as new populations us them .but they will not be ran with oil .so indeed , there will be fewer cars ran with oil than there are today .
