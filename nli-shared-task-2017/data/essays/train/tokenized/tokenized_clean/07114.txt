as i m italian , i can maintain that this statement is probabilly wrong : actually , my personal experience shows that the trend is the opposite .when i was a child , there were only one car per family and you could have seen the same situation when my parents were young .if you have lived in the early-fourties of the last century , probabilly you could nt afford a car : only rich people had one .now , let s take a look at today situation , cars are everywhere !i do nt want to condemn this trend - i own a car too - but that s a matter of fact and , i think , in the future it will be one of the main issue in every politician s agenda .you can find many reasons to explain why everyone wants a car , nevertheless i m virtually sure that it is due to the difficult to travel around with trains , buses and taxis - and the latter are very expensive here in italy .if you have a date , surely you do nt wish to be late , but if you take a train , you could never know when you arrive nor if you arrive in the right place .i think it s time to introduce an example .today there is my toefl test , nonetheless public drivers have made up their minds to strike .unless i would come here by feet , i was obliged to drive my car .you have to consider that such a situation happens about twice a month for buses , twice a month for trains , twice a month for planes ; surely it s not surprising the fact that people prefer to go to work with thair own cars .even if your family is small , as my family is , you need at least two cars , because your father has to go to work in time and you do nt want to be late for your university course .to summarize , i do nt think that cars will be fewer in the next years and surely we will have to cope with pollution .if politicians want to stop this trend , they are requested to improve public transports , as buse , for example .but i-m sure that this will not happen in a few years .
