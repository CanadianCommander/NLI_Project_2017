it is controvercial whether having knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subect .i prefer to the latter opinion because of two reasons .the first is self-esteem and the second is specializing .second , having broad knowledge seems to be benifitial for entire life .if you try to be a waking dictionary , however , you need to spend all times to get slight knowledge .on the other hand , if you focus on a specific subject , you will be a specialist in your field .in modern society , most company requires a specific degree in your field .when i tried to entire a report teacher , the company required a highest level s license .therefore , a specific knowlege needs to survive in this hardcore world .first , self-esteem is the most important postuer in my life .the specific goals give us a suitable motivation .without a goal , the motivation does not exist also .when i was a high school student , i was a sports player and i wanted to be a national athlete .then i got a serious injury at a game .because of the injury , i had to stop playing game and change my dream .my parents wanted me to study and become a teacher .i accepted the proposal from them .however , it has been my dream entire my life to be a national athletes .i could not continue to be a thecher .i returned to a player .some people can said me
