communities have been there for the people themselves in making their lives easier .during ancient times communities meant a lot to those ( people ) who belong to them .does the communities still have the same significanace in one s life , now ?absolutely no , thats what that could be seen .so obviously people are not giving enough time for them .with the advent of industrialization people are getting more and more mechanical and self - involved than ever before .since nowadays they there are things which does nt need involvement .for example if want to buy fruits , all you need to to is to go to supermarket and pay there and return back , but it was different earlier when people were using barter system there it required more interaction among people and consequently more interaction with the communities .with the mechanical life people have comparatively very less time even for themselves and for their families so it is not surprising if they do not have a lot of time for their communities .industrialisation not only brought machanical life but also devaluation of the emotions .people not only devalue the morals but also the significance of community ,people now have more greed for money and less heed for the values .all what people can do for their communities is donating money but it is not always the best way .for example , in most of reputed colleges rich alumunis feel a sense of doing for the betterment of their communities by donating huge amount of money but sometimes it s not the money but rather the need of their expertise , their experience etc , but unfortunately this all requires time which might not be available to them .so , we can see that community s significance has decreased , it could be accounted to the industrialization which made people s life more individualized , paying more attention towards money than the rest with no time for community .therefore , one can be agreed with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities
