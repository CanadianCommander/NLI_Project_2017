generally speaking a successful person is someone who succeed in all his attempts , is good in his job and earns a lot of monnaye .and all of this aspects are often seen in the area of a job .so a successful person must have a good job and has to do his job as no one else , what can lead us to say that he tries new things and takes risks rather than only doing what he already knows how to do well .to my mind , it s right that to be successful somebody must have some nerves to apply some theories or to launch a new product on the market .i think that without any qualities so as to stay undisturbed or the ability to forsee what will have some success , we ca nt have any success .the two qualities , enonced in the subject , are also not enough .sometimes these successful people take risks , just because these risks extist , they do nt care about there success , but they like the game that it implies ; it s not a question of doing well or not .but i must say that there are other people , who one day also try new things with nerves and good ideas , but were unsuccessful .so the fact to try new things and to take risks is not an insurance that our project will succeed .there is a part of luck that we ca nt forget .we can say that successful people are kind of lucky people .and to be carefull is not so bad , i think ; because to do well is not something that anybody can do .it requires qualities , which are not the same as to try something new , and it can appear as more difficult to do well as to be an aventurer .i ca nt forget to say that there is a third class of people , those who do well , who analyse the situation and take advantage of it and so are successful .and we can take example on these one , because they are a good melt of a raisonable mind and of an aventurer spirit .
