i agree with this statement because i beleive that trying new things and taking risks are more interested than knowing how to do well .in my case , sinec i was ten years old , i have been playing tennis , so i practice tennis every day and sometimes compete on the tennis .when i play on the match , i try to play new thing which is so fantastic for me , and usually , when i try newthings , i can win the tounament .in similar to succesuful people , trying new things and tasking risks are connected to successful things : sports players and successful businessmem .successful sports players are always trying new things and take risks .for example , roger federer , who is tennis champion in the champion .he always enjoys the mathc as well as try new things , which have high risk .however , he is not afraid of takiing risks , and he hits the ball to the opponent  weak point .he takes energey from trying new newthings and taking risks , so he would be tennis champion in th world .therfore , i believe that similar to him , sports palyers show that taking risks and trying new things is neccessary key .in addition to successful sport players , successful businessmen or women are apt to try new things and take risks , but sometimes , they think that taking risks and trying new things have dangerous , but we can make a lot of money and fame .also , in today s society , which is democracy as well as competiotion society , so they always demand winning .i beleive that trying new things and taking risks is concerned with successful people .in fact , sports players and businessmen or women show that .
