doubtless inventions were and are still the motor of the developement of mankind .what would the world look like without fire , wheels or iron ?inventions are made by people who try new things or improve things .but despite all positive effecs also dangers have to be considered .today the know how of many firms is their most valuable posession .if you invent something and get a patent for it you might become wealthy because everybody who wants to use your idea has to pay for that .moreover the history teaches us , that knowledge can determine about winning or loosing wars .just think of gun powder and fire arms which led to success in wars at the end of the middle age or the famous enigma-machine in the second world war .but inventions are not the only form of trying somthing new .a famous saying says : `` there is nothing that ca nt be improved !for example if you have already working marketing strategies ; why not try something new ?perhaps new ones might be more successfull and you will b able to sell more goods .a friend of mine worked in china .he saw workers manufacturing something quite slowly because they combined its parts in the wrong order .when he suggested to change the order they were afraid of trying something new and take the risks .so their output kept slow .in other words when you take the risk to try something new , you will be unique in a certain way , because nobody had done this before .this is a clear advantage in competitions for instance between two companies .but going along with that everybody shold be aware of the dangers .for example when nuclear energy was first used for building bombs .despite they were built to kill there was another aspect some scientists were afraid of .they predicted that it might be possible that the heat of the detonation will initiate a chemical reaction which will completely burn the atmosphere .today we know better , but what would have happened if they were right ?better not to imagine !in other words to discover new things will nomally create advantages for people , firms and the whole mankind .but make shure that you know the dangers and that you can handle them .
