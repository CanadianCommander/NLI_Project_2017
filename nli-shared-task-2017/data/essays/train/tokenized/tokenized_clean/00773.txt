nowadays almost everybody can afford a car , something unimaginable a few decades ago .i ca nt now imagine a world without cars .i believe the use of cars will never decrease .furthermore , i m sure there will be more cars in use each year thanks to the development and needs of society .there are several reasons to think so .to start with , we all know the convinience of using cars , such as having more freedom or determinig one s sozial status .i will give an example to support that they can determine a sozial status .my neighbour has been earning for some years to buy a very expensive car .he s not rich but he just bought this desirable car to make people think he is a very prosperous and rich person .another argument is that technology is in constant change .probably in twenty years cars will have such entice things that everybody will desire one .no matter how much expensive it may be , a lot of people will be affording all their lives to get the best one .a third reason is that economy is thriving all over the world , and more people will be able to buy a car in some years .i feel that those who nowadays use other means of transportation desire to have a car .from the arguments i have stated above it can be seen that in twenty years there will be as much cars as there are today , or even more .they provide us a lot of benefits such as making our lives easier and exiting .
