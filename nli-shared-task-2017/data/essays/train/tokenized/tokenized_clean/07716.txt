yes , i agree with the statement that only people who take risks will be successful .it is important to know what i can and can not do .the most important thing is to be good at what i do and to concentrate on one specivic opject or part .in the modern times there are so many people that for example work as designer that it is not possible to work just as such .everybody needs no have a certain speciality like interior designer or as a designer for cars .success only comes with individuality .there are so many designer there is no way of beeing successful when you just do what everyone does .like because everyone this season thinks red and length sripes are trendy that should not make you only design red and length sriped chairs , skirts or what ever the provetion is .it should make the person make green skirts with pink points on it .that is shourly risky because maybe no one will buy them but maybe because of everybodys having red , some individuals like having green .as soon as a person looses the thrill of beeing better he has stopped to be good .success comes and goes and only thous how keep on working on their own knowlege can keep on beeing successful .bringing new ideas and finding spots on the market that have not yet been discovered is the most surten way to make something big .therefor only beeing good at what you do , does not make someone autmaticly successful .but taking the risk of going one step further then everyone else can will make the differnec .
