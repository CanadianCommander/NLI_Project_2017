this is an interesting question .i do not realy think , that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today .one of the reasons is , that earth population is growing every minute .more people need more cars .today a family with four persons has typically at least three cars and that will not change in the next twenty years .maybe we will not have enough place and streets for all the cars , but than we will have to find new ways were we can drive our cars .that could be streets above our cities or in the underground .an argument against my oppinion could be , that we will not have enough energy for all the cars in twenty years .this has to be considered .oil is getting fewer and fewer and therefor more expensive .in the near future nobody can affort driving a car with gas .but i think the human beeing has a lot of ideas to keep the comfort of driving cars .maybe we will use bio cars , or oxzgen cars but i am sure , we will use cars .another argument is , that car production is a hugh industry worldwide .millions of people are working in this industries .what would happen to them , if we would produce fewer cars .i do not realy see an alternative to cars .using the underground train , or a bus is not as comfortabe as driving with my car from door to door .if i go with the train for example i have to take the bus to come to the train station .at my destination i again have to take a bus or a taxi .such a short journey to an other town could take a lot of time and also could be very expensive .with my car i can use my navigation system an go from door to door in half of the time .
