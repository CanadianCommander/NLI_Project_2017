we ca nt undertand each others and also new ideas .in my opinion , this is the biggest problem for global world .i strongly agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , students have to learn ideas before the effects .because if they did nt learn the idea ofcourse they ca nt guess the effects .the biggest scientist einstein said : `` understanding problem is fifty percent equal to solving problem  .the biggest example comes to mind is my college years .i m industrial engineer and i wrote 2 books about lean production and value stream mapping .i went to ford s factory but i could nt make a good job because i had nt understand the ford s manufacture system .when i solve the system i catched lots of mistake in the productions .second of all , if students understand the idea after they try to learn this ideas effects and they check the effects for daily life .when i learned the game theory for economy firstly i started to use for my own company and i learned all effects .
