i am not agree with this statement .i am not agree with this statement because , from my point of view , it wo nt be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .i my opinon it will be more cars firstly because they will give a major utility and we could do many more things with our car than we can do today .in twenty years time , cars will have everything included and you will be able to do whatever you want while you are driving .this is one of the main reasons that i use to argue that it wo nt be less cars in the future than nowadays .another reason is that from my point of view , the number of cars will increased because they will be more sefety and this fact will aloud underaged people to drive a car because they will have many systems to prevent the accidents .since many time , cars have been the most safety transport in the world , and i think this is not going to changed , because cars companies moves a lot of money and they will do everything to sell more cars and make them more safety and comfortable .another fact that in my opinion will make the number of cars increase in the future is that the goverments are spending a lot of money in the rebuilt of many highways that will make the trevel by car more safety , comfortable a safer .to sum up , i would like to say that for me , cars are a very important part in our daily life and it will be an more important in twenty years than there are today .
