in general i agree with this statement .when are too frighted to beginn new projects , activities or somethink else , you do nt give yourself the chance to develop .in my opinion especially in a business environment you could have no success without new ideas and inovations every day .you must face challanges every day .if you just relaxe and do only the thinks you already know , your competitors wo nt give you a chance .in the modern society you always have to be the best .you must be the owner of many abilities .if your mind is not open you ca nt have any success .when you regarde famous successful people , like ...for example , they all had ideas and no fear to fight for them .but on the other hand , if you do the things you know well you are getting better and better .at least , i would say , you have to be open for new things but you also should improve the abilities in the thinks you already know .
