i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .that is because young people are busy on their business time and on their private time .let me explain why young people are busy on those two time .on business time , young people are apt to have a lot of tasks comparing to a business person in 20 years ago .in this two decades , most of companies in the world have been decreasing a redundant costs .so a lot of workers is dismissed .consequently business persons who can avoid lay off have a lot of tasks which dismissed workers have .in my case , i work at a famous bank in japan which is bank of tokyo mitsubishi .i always work from 9 am to 22 pm because of having many tasks .bank of tokyo mitsubishi made lay off in last year.2000 workers were dismissed .in my department which is composed of 8 bankers , two old bankers were dismissed .so the tasks for 6 bankers increased .therefore i do not have a enough time to helping my communities in weekday .on private time , young people are also busy .young people have a lot of media , for instance mobile phone and internet , comparing to a person in 20 years ago .so young people are apt to spend a lot of time for using those medea .for my experience , my mobile phone ring 20 times in a day .my parents and friends always telephone me .additionally i was recieved 50 e-mails in a day .so i need a lot of time for responing those calling and e-mails .i do not have a enough time to helping my communities on my private time .as a mentioned so far , i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .as developing of business and techenology , we are tend to be busy
