this topic is not easy to answer directly .depending on the personal experience , everybody will have the different answers .some people will agree meanwhile some will disagree instead .in my point of view , travelling in a group led by a tour guide or by themselves is related to the conditions and personal abilities at any rate .both to travel in a group led by a tour guide and go trip on their own have countless advantages .im my opinior , i would like to travel along when i am above 20 years old .it is because that i can enjoy the trip in the processing not only the result .for example , i can choose the bike-trip and go anywhere i would like to go in china .i can stay more time when i have been interested in it .i can go to the place the tour guide will not lead us to go .i think it is the strongest point the people will choose to travel by themselves .the most essential advantage is that during the trip , we can improve our skills and abilities learned from the school and out of the school .i think have a trip on your own is a unforgettable in your life .in contrast , i think it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide when i am just a student .there is no doult that the tour guide will arrange all the things during the trip such as where we live , what we eat , where we should go and when we should spend money .it is easy for us to follow .the most significant advantage is that before the trip , we do nt need to do any work about the trip and make a schedual .it is a comfortable way and convenient for us to have a trip .however travel in a group led by a tour guide have a lot of advantages , you also can choose travel on your own .it is up to you .
