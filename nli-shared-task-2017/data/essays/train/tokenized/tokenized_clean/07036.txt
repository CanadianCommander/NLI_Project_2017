when it comes to advertisements , quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .as far as i am concerned , i agree with the statement .among countless factors which influence my point .there are three conspicuous aspects as follows : firstly , according to a survey , the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisement because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisements .these cheats take place everywhere and everytime , on tv , on radio , in supermarket , in cyberspace .thousands of people are suffering these kinds of advertisements .another reason can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertisement is to appeal buyers .with the development of high-tech , products are eaeily produced and designed .they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function .how a factory or a supermarket can win in such keen competing advertisement is the key .although honesty is a very imporatnt in morden society , not all advertisements can be honest .nobody wants to spend money on useless produces .so those products should be seemed much more better , beautiful , functional than they really are .thirdly , for many factories and supermarkets or sales , maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements .advertisement is another beautiful none for cheatig advertsements can perfect products .there are not products but music , beautiful scenery in them , of course , not alll advertisements are cheating .many advertiments are good as well as their products .however , just few of them .to sum up , i reallly agree with the notion that most advertsements make products seem much better than they really are .
