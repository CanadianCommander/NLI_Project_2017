i have once read a book talking about different stressful situations people would encounter in their lives and some solutions to these tough problems .one of the unfavorable issues highlighted in the book is how to deal with a heavy traffic jam .undoubtedly , those traffic problems , no matter in which part of the world , has been remaining as a big headache for an extremely long period of time .it seems the governments have tried every possible way to figure it out .thus , here is our concerns : are these policies and strategies being put into effect ?in other words , are we going to see fewer cars on the road in , say , twenty years ?from my point of view , i assume the dream would become true one day in future , though , i m not good at forecasting things ahead .firstly , it is now strongly advocated by policy makers to take public transportation system rather than driving private cars when traveling outside .as a matter of fact , this plan is working well steadily .people gradually have noticed that it is more convenient to take buses or subway to go to work and school than to drive private cars .take the subway as a striking example , if you take it to go to work during the rush hour in the morning , you wo nt be faced with traffic problems at all .you do nt have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of moving your cars , in this sense , you can totally guarantee your arriving time at office and have nothing to worry about in terms of being late .i believe there is nobody who would like to be blamed by his boss every day merely for not being on time .consequently , i found no reason for people to ignore the positive alternatives and still stick to his traditional and impractical ways .in this case , there will be fewer and fewer people who purchase cars , or at least drive their cars during rush hours on weekdays .furthermore , the price of gasoline is increasing rapidly in recent time , which causes more and more people to complain that they barely could afford the cost .thus , in light of being more economical , the majority of people would not incline to buy more cars .
