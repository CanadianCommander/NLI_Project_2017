there are those who try new things and take dangeous risks , and there are others who try things which are already know to do well .from my point of view , it is better to do new things even though there are a lot of heavy risks .there are several advantages of doing new things ; new experience and sense of achievement .first of all , i can experience new things and gain my knowledge .as i try and challenge new things , i would find something important and valuable lessons that i do not know .for instance , i am joining in swimming club right now .since my coach moved to new swimming club , new coach came my club .of course , new coach did nt know my major stroke which was free style .i told him about my major stroke , but he recommended me that i should swim at competition as breast stroke swimmer .i was surprised because i never challenged to compete as breast stroke swimmer and that competition assembled very expert and elite swimmers .but i wanted to try my best .before the competition , i practiced so hard and asked my coach how i can swim breast stroke fast .as a result , i could swim the fastest breast stroke in my life at the competition .i learned from this happening a lot .second of all , when i try new things that are never experienced , i would feel sense of achievement .if i try same things that i know how to do well , there is no feeling after i finished those things .i would feel boring and tired of it to do .but when i try new things , i would feel exciting and passion to finish those new things as perfect .i would collect data from intruments such as internet and books and ask friends how i can do well .if i finish my works to do new things perfectly , i would feel sense of achievement and exhausted .considering all of above reasons , most of people think it is better way to try things that i already know because they wanted to do well , but when it comes to me , i believe that people should try new things even thought there are a lot of dangeous risks and difficulties .people should learn valuable lessons from new experiences and feel sense of achievement .
