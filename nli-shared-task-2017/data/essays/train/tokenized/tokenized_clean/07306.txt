eversince the last century , the car , introduced by the worldwide-best-seller ford-t in the twenties , has become the most popular mean of transportation .and nowadays it has even become more than that .actually , the car is now much more than just a mean of transportation , it has become a real social attribute , the bigger your car is , the higher you are on the social ladder .reducing the number of cars does not only implies a change in our habits of transportation but a complete change in the way we think .another example of the way the car has influenced our society are the american cities .the way these cities are built is nearly an ode the car . ..it s too difficult to move without a car , but that does nt matter because cars are still cheap in the us .i do nt think twenty years will be enough ( a genration is twenty-five years ) for our socity to change .however , some issues could help .indeed , the environment and particularly the global warming have become major issues for our planet , and the car is one of the biggest pollution sources on the planet .furthermore , the planet is running out of oil , implying an expensive energy , and that s becoming more and more a problem .however i am not worried for the future of the car , because new technology will overcome these diffculties .we are nearly entering a new era , electric or even hyrogen engines will soon be availiable , leaving a bright future to the car .cars wo nt disappear , they re just entering into their revolution , that s it .when i was young i used to think that aliens existed , well actually i do think they exist , and i thought that the first thing they ll see when arriving on earth would be our roads and our cars moving at any time of the day and night .for sure they would think that the inhabitants of earth would be cars . ..why would you want the inhabitants of earth to disappear ?
