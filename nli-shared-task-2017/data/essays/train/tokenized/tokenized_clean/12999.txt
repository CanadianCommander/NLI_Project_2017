many people prefer to travel with groups with tour guides , but i totally do not agree with this way of travel .there are number of disadvantages if someone choose to make a group tour with guides .such as lack of flexibility of the schedule , loosing the oppotunities to meet new friends and inconvinience caused by the large group .first of all , the schedule is not flexible for the guided group tours .let us assume that you are on a trip .if you are in the group , all you can do is just folloing the guide and listen to him/her .on the other hand , if you make your own trip , you can go to anywhere you want and whenever you want .if you feel tired from hiking yesterday , you can sleep a couple of more hours if you want .the second reason that i do not prefer the group tour is that i do not want to loose the oppotunity to get close to native people .the hilight of a trip can be making new friends from all over the world .i simply can not afford to loose the chance to make a conversation , exchange political opinions and so on .finally , if you are in a group , it takes much more time to move to another place .for example , if you are waiting in the line in the airport , you have to still wait for your company even though you are finished with your process .however , if you are alone or with a small group , you do not have to waste your time to wait for the people whom you really do not know .in my opinion , true travel has to made up by travelers themselves so that they can experience more and feel more .the most important thing you can get from a travel is how much you felt and experienced , not how many places you have been or see .
