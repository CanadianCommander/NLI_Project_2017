in my point of view understanding ideas and concepts is very important .the subject like a java , we can know the knowledge of java by understanding the ideas and concepts .concepts is more important than facts .by studying the facts like sun microsystems invented the java , we ca nt understand the features of the java .we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts .facts can also improve the knowledge .by studying the facts like independense we should know about the great leaders of our country , and we should know about the how they will work hard for the independense .history will tell about this .so learning the facts were important .by studing the facts the children can learn about the honesty , relibility , and history of the country .everyone must should know about the history of the country .by learning the facts we can prevent the wars like second world war and the first world war .by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods , it was very intrresting .last week some of the persons found the dwaraka under the sea , so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were dwaraka in the past .by understanding the concepts and ideas we can improve the knowledge of the subject and we can improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject .we ca nt understand the concepts like polymorphism and abstracton while learning about the facts .all the students can understand by understanding the concepts and ideas of the subject .conceots were very important and ideas were also important .for understanding subjects the students could know about the ideas and concepts .there would be necerrely facts for the students because for know about the past .in this days , understanding the concepts is very importants for future importance .
