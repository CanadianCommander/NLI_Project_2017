i wil agree that the best way to see places is by travelling in a group led by a tour guide .by doing so we can get a good company , as there are many people with us , we can see more places , and we can collect more infrormation about the places , and further more many people can get their living by doing the travelling guide jobs .i belive that there are mainly three reasons why i agree travelling with a group led by a tour guide .the first reason is we can have a good company .this is because many people are travelling with us .we can have a good talk with them , and even more we can learn some thing new from them .and the second reason is we can see more places in the tour .we did not feel lonly by that .by visiting more places we can learn more informaton about them from the travel guide .he will say the history , and importance of that place .he will show us each and every place that has importance .as a good example , when i and my friends visited kalahasti one of the most important place in indai , we dont know any thing about that palce , just we got few directions about the palce like where to stay and how to go to places .when we came to place with that directions , they are very confusing we cant understand any thing .so , we share our money and keep a guide to help us .he helped us very much by showing all the places and keep on telling their importance .even though we spend money , we enjoyed the tour very much .and the last reason why , i prefer the tour guide is , they make the living with the money , the tourists gave to them .their entire family is based on that money .this money will encouraging the people to do the job of travelling guide .for all these reasons , i prefer travelling with a group , that was led by a tour guide .
