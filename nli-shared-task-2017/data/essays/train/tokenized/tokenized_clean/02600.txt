imagine a person in annual vacation in rome and waking up at 7 oclock in the morning .this is what happen when the person travels with groups and usually the groups are more funny but they are much less comfortable because they visited less places , tight the person to a committment .the groups usually visited less places eventhough they usually know more places but because there is a large number in groups and to manage them and take them in a tour or to guide it demands such a great effort .but when the person is alone , he can goes indivisually , smoothly and simply from point a to point b andcan manage him self to visit where ever he want because the indivisual can tell if he got enough energy for a long tour among the old city or better for him to stay in the pool area relaxing , drinking and taning .and also the groups always tight the tourist into a restrict scedule and committment .when he sometimes the tourist is tired or out of his energy do nt ever try to miss the tour because it s simply not repeated .and for indivisuals it s always a matter of mood .finally it s quite a difference between indivisuals and groups but i highly recommended for tourists to travel as indivisuals and enjoy the real tours and cruises .
