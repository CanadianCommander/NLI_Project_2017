this is a controvertial topic about whether the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .as far as i am concerned , there will be fewer cars .my reasons are listed as follows .first , we should take a glance at the opposite opinions .some people will deem that with the rapid economic growth ( especially in china ) , people will continue to buy their own cars because it is a convenience to their lives , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowded bus , which is commonly seen in china .however , these people seem to ignore several essential aspects that would lead to the reduce of the numbers of cars .the important reason is that people s awareness of protecting the environment is gradually increased .we all recognize the fact thatour environment is facing serious problems caused by human pollution , like global warming and water pollution , air pollutions .and the government as well as the increasing number of people are taking effort to protect the environment .they can give up using of plastic bags , so they can also give up buying their own car .the equally important reason is that the oil price skyrockted in the last year and the prices are going to increase in the future .it is just too expensive to afford a car to the majority of people because they have to use a lot of money to support their family , to pay for the education fees of their children , and to pay for the medical services .they will choose to use public transportations due to the higher and higher oil price .moreover , the government is taking great effort to build public transportations .they use a large number of money on developing more rail road , more buses to every corner of the contry .and also metros have been built to easing the heavy traffic in more and more big cities .taking into account of all the aspects mentioned above , i am firmly convinced with the opinion that the number of cars will reduce in twenty years .
