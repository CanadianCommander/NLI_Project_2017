as a high school student , i am often pretty upset and even a little irritated of the generally misconception of the young generation has become more selfish if compared with the previous generation .that is , frenquently heard from adults that young people have no contribution to others and even the communities they belong to .that is completely wrong !take my school for instance , we do care about our communities and in fact spend plenty of time to do all kinds of voluntary works in out communities .almost every weekend , students from different grades gather together in front of our school at seven in the morning .you may be quite curious what we are going to do ?it s saturday !students then be divided into several groups by teachers and after that , it s time for us start our mission .actually , we are assigned different jobs to do every weekend ; sometimes we clean the streets which we do most frequently ; sometimes we visit some charities in the community to do voluntary jobs for them ; sometimes we clean the park , located next to our school ; sometimes we hold band performances as entertainment for people in the community who have no idea what to do on the weekends .sounds interesting and tempting ?absolutely .stuents at my school are encouraged to join these activities because our teschers stress that school is nt the only place for learning .to tell the truth , this is excatly what i think and the most important reason encouraging me to give up my holidays .i still remember clearly once we were to visit kids with similar ages with us but suffer from mental illness or other disabilities .i was quite afraid because i thought they might be scary in both appearances and behaviors .but what i had seen was their most sincere smiles and enthusiaism to make friends with each us .from then , i started to visit them frenquently with some books and clothes as gifts for them .i come to realize there is never a border between people , once i ve decide to open my mind to accept and respect .these activities held by schools to encourage students to get involved in their communitues are nt unheard form other shcools and other parts of my country .young people are nt careless about involving and helping others in thier communities but rather entusiaistic and willing to help , once we know how to step out our first step .
