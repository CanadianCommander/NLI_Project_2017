the mans need for decrease in time for travelling has resulted in increased number of vehicals .the most common means of transport is through public .but , with growing needs of man this is not the case .man has started to buy his own vehicals mostly cars as they provide a convenient mode of transportation .the one of the reasons behind this is that a car provides a perfect mode of transportation for the whole family .the car is more benificial as it provides a lot of space sit and provides a lot of space to carry things that are required to make a perfect holiday .this is unlike public transportation were you will have to carry your own luggage where ever you go thus , leaving your belongings to their own fate .there is an increase in number of cars used now a days .as they not only provide total satisfaction but also provide an image in the society .today we distinguish people by their clothing , their social behaviour and their social status .thus , in a race to prove their social status men have bought cars and bikes that are real expensive .not only that the modern day youth is obssesed by the fastest cars available thus leading to increase in motor sports like formula 1 and etc .the advancement in technology has drasticaly effected the requirements to built a car that fits the modern day world .the companies like hundai etc ; have made techincal advancements like introducing microprocessor chips inside a vehical feul system .have made the youth crazy them .unlike the past there are a lot of companies that offer quality products thus insearch of a good marketing stratagie these motor vehicals were made more technically equiped .thus leading to technical advancements where one could automat his vehical to reach his destination , he could find which hotel is nearby and can even access internet and could see where he is .this is made possible through satellite communication known as gps .thus all these advancements in technologies would lure even a common man to buy a car rather than travelling through public transportation .thus i see a growth in increase in number of cars rather than a decrease .
