the producers use advertisements to introduce the products to the consumers .the income of company depends on how much it sells its product by appealing effecitvely to the audience through advertisements .also , certain company might be in a competition with another company , thus it would wish to make a better advertisement to sell more products .because of these competitive natures of advertisement , the producers often make products seem much better than they actually are .a company s main goal is to sell as much product as possible to grow economically .in order to sell a great number of products , a company first has to appeal to the consumers .by making advertisements that make products look much better than the actual product , a company can encourage the audience to at least come and look at their product .even though the consumer may not buy the product , he or she will know about it since it appealed to them effectively through the advertisement .if the advertisement did not make the product look that great , the consumer would not even consider to come and see it .for example , an advertisement of a new car or a computer demonstrates that the product guarantees the consumer s satisfaction .however , any human made product is bound to have mistakes and some errors .when the consumer purchaes this newly advertised computer , he or she will soon discover some malfunctions which is not what the advertisement suggested .because the company made such an appealing advertisement , it was able to sell its product , which was their primary goal .another reason the company uses advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is the competition with other companies .the competition causes the producer to want to discourage the consumers to buy the other company s products and only buy the product of his or hers .in order to cause this discouragement is to make an effective advertisement .to win the competition , an exaggeration of its product will not be the company s main concern .thus , the company will willingly make its product look much better in its advertisement than it actually is .the advertisements are the main means of communication betweenthe producers and the consumers .to sell more products and to survive in the competition with other companies , a certain company will not hesistate to make product seem much superior to the actual product .
