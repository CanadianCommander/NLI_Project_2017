the mindful body : a peculiar paradigmi think that specialize in one specific subjcet is better .specialising you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospective and than increase your field of study .let give us some example based on my experience as anthropologist .i think they could clearly illusterate what i mean .during my anthropological field work in cameoon , west africa , i argued that there were lots of intresting aspects of this african society ( for example kinship , economical or religious sistems etc . ) .however i decided to foucus my reserch on witchcraft and sorcery .observing life in a small village i saw that i colud note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric .the occult power was used a socilal and economical levellhood .moreover when i wrote my ba s thesis i used a specifical prospective and a peculiar method of analysis .i used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese chirstians and i demostrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese chistians and others religious movements .i tried to anlize just one aspect of the african or japanese society and i tried to explain how these particular aspects reflected on whole society in different levels .i think that have a broad knowledge of may academic subjects is not good or usefull .a man could not be omniscent - as god - so is uneuseful try to accumulate many many notions about different arguments and topics .thus men , students , professors and so on need to recognize their limits and to work - as better as possible - on within their field of study .this are the reasons why i think that specialize in one specific subject is the only way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledge .
