i agree with the idea of that young people enjoy life more than older people do .when we look around us , we can easily see that young people are walking around the city , going to the theatres .doing something else , while older people staying at their houses .young people enjoy life more than older people because they have the energy that the young ages give to them and also as a result of some religious things .firstly , young people naturally have the energy to be able to more active than the olders .if you are young , you do not have any important health problems , you can walk , run as long as you want .young people have an energy inside them which does not let them to be stable .in my country , turkey , we describe this situation as ` not being ablo to fit her  his cup` .as a benefit of this energy , they enjoy life more than older people can do .moreover i greatly believe that , especially in my country , this situation , that young people enjoy life more than older people do , is a result of some religious circumstances .older people think that they are close to death and they feel the end of their life .so they consume their time especially for praying and doing something for the life after death .older people think that using their rest of days for entertainment is very disadvantegeous for them .however , young people does not afraid from death , because they are not close to death as older people .so they walk around , go to discos , theatres and they gain the taste of life .to sum up , it is very clear that young people tend to enjoy the life .as a result of the energy that they have and not to feel themselves to close to the death , younger people live their life more entartainmently than the old people do .
