famous researchers , important people or successful stars have a common point : they all look further afield , wanting to meet other people and to broaden their horizons .for all that , i think you can be successful only if you take risks , if you test and try new things ; so you can be successful only if you want or search something you do nt have yet .famous and successful people are very often ambitous and courageous people .when we take a closer look at christophe colomb , bill gates or john ford , we can see that they all had something in their personality that encourage them to test , to search , to try something unknow and rather risky .how can you have sucess if you only do what other people have already done ?how can you have success if there is no originality in your prospect and objectives ?i will now tell you about a personal experience to show you have sometimes to take risks to succeed .because most of the time , the opportunities do nt come to you .but you have to create these opportunities .here is my personnal experince : towards my final year at the secondary school , i had to combine a lot of things : i had to study for my `` baccalaureat  , i had to take final exams in flute and piano , to obtain a certificate in music theroy at the conservatoire in besancon , and to gain my drinving license .a lot of people said i had to give up music .but i was determined and i took the risks to continue my music and all my undertakens .this was risky .i could have failed .but i succedeed .and therefore i was able to find a very interessing placement in a big international company .to conclude , taking risks and trying new things is a very important and unavoidable condition to succeed .you have to be courageous , to experiment and to look further afield to success .
