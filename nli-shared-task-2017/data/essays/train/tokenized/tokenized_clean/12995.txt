i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisements are meant to convince potential buyers to purchase certain items .therefore , in order to convince the buyers , advertisements almost always make products appear better than they really are .my reading of an article on the local newspaper and my personal experience of purchasing a skin care product prove this point to be true .i once read an article on a local newspaper that informed readers about the art of advertisement .the article said that in order to convince the potential buyers to purchase certain items , the advertising market must make the products to appear as amazing as possible , even if they appear better than they actually are .so that potential buyers will be convinced of the products  worth and effectiveness .if the advertisements make the products seem worse or the way they really are , they will have a more difficult time to convince buyers .in my opinion , the article had a point .in addition to the article , my personal experience also proves that most advertisements make products seem better .i have always wanted clear , smooth skin .i remember seeing an advertisement of a skin care product on the television .the product was described in the advertisement to be so effective that i was completely convinced before even trying it .however , after purchasing the skin care product and using it for two months , i still had countless pimples on my face and the quality of my skin did not improve at all .this experience showed me that advertisement make products much better than they really are .both the article on my local newspaper and my personal experience prove to me that most advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .in numerous cases , the products that buyers purchase in reality do not live up to their descriptions in their advertisements .so next time when i purchase an item , i will not judge its worth and effectiveness just by looking at its advertisement .
