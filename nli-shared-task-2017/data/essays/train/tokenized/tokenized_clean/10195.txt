the statement i am going to deal with is ` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .i agree with the statement because an advertisement is meant to emphasize the positive characteristics of certain products and not to give a objective description .there are large companies which dedicate themselves to the research of human behaviour in order to analyse how to gain the interest of a huge amount of people for a product for instance in a tv commercial .they try to characterize people of different ages and different origins into interest groups and then figure out which interest group would be the most effective for selling the product to .then they come up with a commercial that directly points at this very special interest group and that s why members of this interest group are so attracted to the advertisement and think better of the product than it actually is .in order to emphasis my point i would like to give an example for a consumer who fell for that advertisement trap : me .two years ago when i still stayed at my host parents house in washington i went to the baseball try-outs of my highschool because i never played baseball before .my host dad gave me one of his old baseball glove ( must have been about 40 years old ) and so i tried out .i had been a pretty good pitcher back in germany so i thought it would be much of a problem to join the team ( at least the reserve team ) .instead of showing my pitching skills the coach wanted me to catch a couple of balls with my glove .i tried to do so but i could nt really figure out how to use the old glove so the ball would actually stick in there .after the try-outs the coach told me to come back when i was was abel to catch properly with my glove .that day i saw a brand-new glove at a sport goods store .it was all black and had a faked autograph of saome major legue baseball player i never even heard of on it .the commercial sign right next to it said `` you gon  catch every ball !.my host dad told me it was overpriced but for about the next couple of days i went to that store and looked at that glove .after a couple days i finally decided on buying that glove .the next day i went out to the field with my host dad to play catch .i proudly told him that i was going to catch any ball .actually i could nt catch anything .i m just a bad catcher , that s what the 60 dollars i paid for the glove made me realize and showed , that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
