in all compagnies of productions , people use advertisements to make a product to look better than they really are .advertisement , it is a kind of subtutition that people add to their product to change the naturel face of the product which will look better .here are three major reasons why i am agree whith this statement such as publication , the beauty of the package , and the ingredients .first , while i am talking about the publication of the product , i am refering to how people publish the product once when the product is ready to be on the market .to publish their products , they have many way such as to present an emission on the tv about their products , to write an announcement in the journals , or to distribuate their product in different sompagnies which will help them to sell quickly .they also have to put a nice decoration and a good publicity , so when a clients see that , theyh can be attracted to that product .this reason is very important because it helps the clients to have more desire to buy this product .after , the beauty of the package is also important because you have to have a good knowlegde in order to create a nice , pretty design on the package of the product to make the products seem much better than they really are because this can also attract the clients .for example , if you look the package of one cereal `` capitain crunch  which is recognize in the whole of the world , you can see how people draw on this package to attract the clients to have a desire to buy the cereal and also give them a good appetit .then , ingredients are some kind of subtitutions that people add to the naturel products to change them to look better than they used to be like colarnts and many others things .for example , the cereal has many subtutitions on it like corns , colorants to loopk very good to eat .in c
