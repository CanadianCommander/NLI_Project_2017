should we study in the specific subject as some people content ?i agree with this point insofar as that as a college student the major course is important for us .however , those people might begs the question by neglecting the fact that the `` ture education  means having many different area knowleage .when i face with this situation , i prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic .in one important aspect , studying other subject is clearly accurate in the extent that every subject could connect with each other .they could not stand by their own , for example , without the knowledge about math , chemistry will not do the correct the data from the lab .in addtion , for `` ture education  the more significant consideration is that in the modern society , we need many differert subject knowledge to have our own become more competitive when facing the development of the technology .any observant person could list the adequate to illustrate this point , consider the development of the computer .if we do not know how to computer , which company might employ us and how we get the so many information around the world ?aside from the two propositions mentioned above , one caveat might come along with having too knowledge of other subjects .specializing in our major subject provide the us to get the certain job in subject .the contrary side of board knowledge would mirror a too-narrow view about the true education and its adequate objective .i would admonish that extending the point too far may risk having a chilling effect on the university study .in sum , even though i prefer to have broad knowledge about the different subjects , no area of the education could operate in a vacuum .to becoming `` true education  , we must strike the apt balance between the major study and the pursuit .whether means of education is justifiable must be determined on case-by-case basis by weighting the benefit of the individual and society .
