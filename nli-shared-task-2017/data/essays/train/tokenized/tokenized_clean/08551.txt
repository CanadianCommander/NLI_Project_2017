i can see a lot of advertisements when i walk on the road or drive the road .also , i can see advertisements in tv comercal .i agree with most adbertisemebts make products seem much better than they really are .there are a lot of reasons that i think .first , when i was in japan , i went to shopping with my friends .we were very hungry at that time , so we went to have lunch then we saw a lot of advertisements of food such as sweets , humbergar , spaggetie , and japanese food .afterwards , we decided to have lunch in one restourant , but when we ordered lunch , it didi nt seem it that we saw advertisement in front of the shop .we were very dissapointed that this is very diffrent between advertisement and real one .second , neary 2 years ago , i got in america to study my major .i am an international student from japan in the united states .i see a lot of advertisements on tv hambergar in particular .now i cook japanese food by myself because when i saw one of the hamburger shop comershal , it looked really delicious , so i and my friends went there to eat ; however , it was jut too big , and taste was not good .as a result , i do nt believe the kind of advertisements .advertisments in the united state is more awful than japanese advertisments .they make food delicious or beautiful , but it taste horroble .on the other hand , in japan they also make food delicious , but it is very delicious actually , so company in america should improve this kind of things .thrid , the company should tell really things to customer because that kind of happning occur everyday , almost all of customer might not believe companies .there are only 2 examples , but i have gotten more problem about these things .i agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because i have gotten kind of problems , so i do nt really believe in advertisments especially food .company should make good advertisments then show custmers .if they do nt do it from this time , almost all of customer might not believe it anymore .
