there is great debate on the academic arena about whether to have broad kowledge on many academic disciplines or to specialize in one specific subject .nowadays , people are highly puzzled with this question and are having difficulties to choose their path .depending on my personal experience and the conjuncture of today s world i would definetely claim that specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial to one .to begin with , globalisation is at its peak on the 21st century .this fact brings a lot of communication tools like television , cable tv , internet , ...etc .all these sources of communication feed people with information .although , load of information sometimes creates confusion still it makes an awareness .thus , in the globalised world more people know more things on more issues .in other words , most of the people became able to have a say on any issue with the information coming from communication sources .this , made the `` general information  less valuable .in the past , there was no internet or tv .access to information was valuable .thus , being able to talk on any issue was a virtue .nowadays , having general information is accepted as something normal .so , it is expected from people to say more professional and more specific things about their issue which makes the specialization in one specific subject necessary .secondly , i am an international relations student at a university .i am planning to graduate this year .however , i realized that i would face difficulties in finding a job .the reason is that when i graduate from this department i would be able to say something on every issue without being a specialst on any of them .to illustrate , i know something about microeconomics and macroeconomics - because i took that lectures during my 4 year education - but i am not an economist .just in the same way , i know about psychology and sociology a little but i am not a psychologist or sociologist .all these facts made me aware that i have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but i need to specialize .thus , i decided to apply for a master s degree .this illustration well explains why specializing is a better choice .in conclusion , the new conjucture of the world which came through the process of globalisation and my personal experience prooves that specialization is a better choice that having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects .the increasing demands of people on having a master s degree in todays world would be another proof of this necessity .
