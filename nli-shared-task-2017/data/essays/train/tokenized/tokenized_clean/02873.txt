will we have more cars in the future or not ?this is a questions that many people would like to find out whether they are car producers , environmentalists , or just regular people who either taking public transportation or owning a car .however , i think it is important to address that different parts of the world might have different results .it is because people in different places give different cultural meanigns of the cars and they might have different priority in relation to what is imporatnt to them as a group .i will start by pointing out how different places preceive cars in some ways and how these differences might increase or decrease cars in the future .first , in some developing countries , such as china , car is a symbol of modernity and wealth .when this connection is formed and built , it is quite difficult to expect that poeple will decrease cars in use within twenty 20 years since what people desire is development .and , this image of developement happend to also means `` having cars .in this sense , i think it is quite unrealisitic to agree that people will diminish the amount fo cars .after all , the major goal of these places is economic development and decreasing the ownership of cars contracdicts to their major goal .on the other hand , for some places in the world , especially countries in the west , the meaning of cars and the prority of what is imporant to them are different .to them , car is more or less merely a tool .although i do realize that some people in the west aslo use car as a symbol of prestige , there is a degree difference in relation to how stronger that a car is tied with the concept of modernity .meanwhile , peopel in teh west might think the envirnment protection is at least as important as development , if it is not more important .in this sense , when cars do not carry such strong desire of being modern , meanwhile the idea of environmentialism is appreciated , it is more likely that there will be less cars in the nearly future .therefore , i think teh amount of cars will decrase in some areas in the world meanwhile decrease in other areas depends on different context and the symbolic meanings of cars in different cultures .i think it is problematic to make a universal statment on this issues .
