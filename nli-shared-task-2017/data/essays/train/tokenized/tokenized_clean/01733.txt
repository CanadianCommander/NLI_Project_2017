in the long run , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts becasue understanding main concept let students to adapt constant understanding about new facts in the long period time , and because students can approach to the factors more intuitively and effectively .fisrt , understanding concept will help the student adapt the new factors in the long run .for example , major business principles learnd in school and informations from pop-bussiness books has different values .the principles may not be easy to use in the real word , but they are proven to be valuable in the long preriod while pop-business books usualy hits in very shor time period .one of the papular movement called ` six sigma  was thought to be a perfact solution of the future market , but it became a cause of less inovation of company because it based on a particular fact in the short time period and ignored lots of key concepts in business principles .second , understanding concepts first will be more effective to understand facts .if a group of business students are given lots of raw datas such as new papers and statistics without learning basic concepts , then they will not be able to understand what the data actually means and their misunderstanding can be greater .this type of learning will be a lot slower than understanding main concepts first .in conclution , i believe that understanding concepts first is better in the long run , because it will let students adapt to various problems , and the students will be able to learn more effectively in the limited time .
