as it is rightly stated by someone that ` prevention is always better than cure  .the world is looking to this by saving and preventing the extreme use of natural resources .so i definitely agree with the idea or statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .to support this i would like to state few of my views as follows .in my coutry like india , where there is tremendous population and for travel purpose there is enormous number of vehicles .more vehicles talk about the private vehicles especially cars , which is used as mode of transport for the entire family , or say individual car for each family member .just imagine what do they do ?they only add to the pollution of the environment .as in air , noise and water pollution .it does not only add pollution but also wastage of natural resources like petrol and diesel .and for this we have to depend on the gulf countries .wherein it is only upto the economical crisis , which indirectly is seen in hiking prices of petrol .what when this resources gets over , traveling will not only become expensive with other alternatives but also impossible one day .some western country have accepted the fact and started more conventional , cheaper and better way of traveling .like traveling on cycles to their work places , places where they have to visit often .by cutting down on air and noise pollution , i think that s a very wise decision one can take , in order to prevent future problems .also travelling on bicycle , one can do cycling exercise everyday which is always good for one s health .i think that it is smart decision , if taken by our govrnment can prove tremendously useful well on which government is already thinking .and be a ` stepping stone  to prevent hazardous problem .and with this thinking and implication in future definitely i think that there be reduction in private vehicles especially the cars in next twenty years .
