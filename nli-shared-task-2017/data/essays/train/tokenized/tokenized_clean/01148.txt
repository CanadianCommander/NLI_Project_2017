i agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts  because understanding gives clarity on the issue .understanding a concept or an idea will help the student in better implementation .when a problem occurs during the implementation of concept , it is important that student knows exactly where to look .this calrity can be attained only by understanding the concept and not by merely learning it .for example , when a student after his graduation joins a software technology firm as a fresher , he is relatively new to the real world .when asked to work on a project , he would feel comfortable with it if he understands the topic .and in the middle stages of implementation , if a problem has occured he will know exactly where to look for .learning facts will not help in understanding complex tasks .there is a danger of gettting stuck , unable to find answers .and also , understanding concepts and ideas help in learnig complex tasks related to the topic .for example , a student who has learned c language in college might find it difficult to learn java .but , a student who understands the concept of c language will find it easy to understand java even though he might not have taken c language as a course in college .after all basics are the foundations for healthy higher learning .this phenomenon can be witnesse from the college level also .a student who is well versed in the basic concepts of high school education has a higher chance of making it to the college than a student who is not .hence i conclude , saying that understanding ideas and concepts is better for a student than it is to learn them just for the sake of learning .
