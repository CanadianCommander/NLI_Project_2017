i do not agree to the idea that the cars will be decreasing in twenty years .the reason is that the people keep seeking convenience .the car is one of the most marble invention in the human history .it makes fast the transportation and wide the working range of the people .it is impossible to make slow the people s commuttance and to make narrow the influence of individule in the future than today .then , we need alternatives to replace the cars .however it is hard to expect that in twenty years .instead , i think the cars might be developed in many way .for example , it can have convinent wings to solve the traffice jam or it can be driven by non-polluting fuels .however , the cars will be more in use , even though the population is decreasing .i live in korea which has a small land but has three major supplier of the cars which called hyundai , deawoo , samsung .that means that the car is very useful and used widespread even in a small land .i also have my personal car and my family has 4 cars with 6 menbers .i would say it is common and getting more common in the world .another reason is that the car industry has much share of the whole industry .it provides many jobs and is supported by much side industries and researches .as i know the industry which has the most big percentage of inventions in the world is the car industry .if the number of cars is decresing , the much of the economies of the world will be affected .therefore , i think it is hard to imagine the decrease of cars in twenty years .
