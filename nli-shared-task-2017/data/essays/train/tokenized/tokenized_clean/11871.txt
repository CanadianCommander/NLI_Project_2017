i gree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks usually turn successful than those who only do what they already know how to do well .first of all , i believe creativeness is one of the most fundamental essences for human inventions .all valuable inventions in the past happened because people then were creative in responding to specific difficulties or needs of the situation .without creativeness , one needs to abide by the negative conditions or hardship .i strongly believe one can learn greatly from failures as well and taking risks will eventually bring the person a profit in the long run .some people may argue that some traditional cultures are better preserved as they are , and i agree with this opinion in principle .however , preserving the culture can take different ways than just leaving them unchanged or untouched .for example , it is often reported that the traditional craftmanship is at danger of being lost because of the change in people s lifestyle .in such cases , the tradition can be preserved by adopting its style to the modern ways , still using the accumulated knowledge or skills to make that happen .without such challenges , that specific tradition may be at more risk of extinction than taking up a creative change .in conclustion , i stronfly believe that being creative and ready to take risks is a very important factor for people to be successful , and hope i will be so in the face of upcoming challenges that i may encounter by studying abroad .
