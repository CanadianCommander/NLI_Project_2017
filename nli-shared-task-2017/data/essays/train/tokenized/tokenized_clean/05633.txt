both types of learning supports have advantages and disadvantages .i will name advantages for both ideas but in my opinion to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts .first , earning facts and events presents the advantage of beeing imaged and more easily understandable .learning facts is possible at every age .it is strong material to link different notions altogether .but alone , it can only make the student status on a particular combinaison of factors at a particular time .for instance , let s take invention : it is nice to have book where all previous discoveries are referenced but it does not help you open your mind and search for something else , it does not create a challenge or a necessity .you just learn from facts not from their reasons , meanings and solutions .second , history and facts play a fundamental role on the civic aspect of an education .it helps interactions as you always learn from the past experiences .but does it always impact and modificate someone s behavior ?of course , on the one hand , practice and real life examples are often poweful learning material and self-explanatory .but on the other hand , it not possible for a human beeing and consequently for a student to learn all facts whereas understanding the related concepts would help him to face any type of situation .as a result , it becomes possible to take measure risk .the student becomes better prepared for both : his personal life and his career .the ` knowledge in youth is wisdom in age  proverb well sums up my point of view .it is more important to understand the concepts than to know their application .
