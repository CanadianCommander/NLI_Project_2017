i do agree with the statement , but i can not be completely sure about it .it is a fact that oil prices are higher than ever before .also the polution shows a lot of economical and enviromental problems and it is enough a reason to stop using the cars because of their leck of usefulness in the cities .oil prices is a principal problem for western countries which have nt their own oil supplies .for example in europe , it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car taxes , insurances and enormous fuel costs .also the leck of space in major cities make the price rise up .one can already see many trends in a lot of cities in europe , e.g. the goverment in vienna is making biking routs in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike places for its habitants .holland is for sure a good example and shows that people are still mobile without a car .a city designer in london said that cars should nt design the city .he meant that cities are not made for cars but for humans .this statement has its truth , when one compares cities in newer countries with older ones .european cities have a natural structure .the old parts mostly the centers are nt designed for cars but more for humans .american cities like caracas they have major problems with mobility of humans .of course they have a metro but the cars made formed the appearance of the city .they have in the middle of the city big highways and it is completely impossible to walk from one point to the other .
