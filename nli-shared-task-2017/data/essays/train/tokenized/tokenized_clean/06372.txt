i haven  t a specific position on this argument , because i think that is important in an equal measure how students understand ideas and how they learn facts .i can make an example to support my answer .everyday we watch on television or read on newspapers that in some part of the world someone has been submitted because he or she wasn  t beautiful , smart , free , cristian or not , and what we do to stop it ?nothing or at least we do a committee in front of some important departments of justice !words only words .using the right words at the right moment , it sometimes can be very useful and permit us to obtain what we want at the beginning .but we usually don  t make anything .we rest to observe in silence the world around us .to preserve and to protect our society , it  s important , for a student , understand the origin of facts studying for example the history of his country - learn facts - , and at the same time , it  s important to know ideas and concepts to understand the background of that fact .
