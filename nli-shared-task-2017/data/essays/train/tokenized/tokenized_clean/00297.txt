in my opinion , young people in various communities from several cultures become less concentrated on their communities and this should be conceived as one of the main sociological concerns for the societies in the world .so i do totally agree with the statement put front .as countries develop economically and socially and relations within the society in question becomes more complicated in various terms .the young people are getting isolated from their own communities .however this situtaion is valid for all of the societies .and this concept is getting affected from a wide variety of sub factors ranging from governmental policies aiming the country match up with the rest of the world , to easiness to reach information with the help of the technological advances .in a world surrounded with above-mentioned conditions , the young people are put forward in a race of getting the best in every field .with this motivation , the young people mainly concentrate on themselves rather than participating in assistance activities towards their communities .rather they do deal with studying a lot , getting into other activities towards self development , attending new classes , etc .of course it should not be asserted that this kind of activities are bad but their role on affecting youth should not be underestimated .to decrease the negative impact , there should be some incentives and couraging factors for the youth to associate with their communities and socialize .because by this way , the youth will find the opportunity to get interacted with its society and feel and conceive the factors and cultural aspects forming his/her society .within these frames , i think , the fact that youth can not assign enough time for helping their communities is mainly based on the environmental conditions as a whole and some measures can be taken by the society in order to prevent this alienation of young people to their societies .
