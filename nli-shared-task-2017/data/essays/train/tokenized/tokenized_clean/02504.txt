i must confess this is a tricky question to answer .i agree to this statement only to some extent .in fact , i strongly believe that people can enjoy their life always during their lifetime and the reason why they do so is much more connected to their personal worldview than to their age .however , i think that there are some ineluctable elements that are closely related to age and that help to enjoy life more , but they are equally distributed between young people and old ones .i will try to use a very simple example in order to show it .on one hand , young people are usually healthier and have more energies than old ones .for these reasons , they can do more activities and spend less time resting .secondly , they are a bit unaware of life , so they often face new challenges with more optimism .thus , they plan very adventurous trips , for instance .on the other hand , older people maybe have less energies and health , but they can afford trips better because they have more money ( at least in my country ! )and they have learnt a lot from life .their experience helps them to know what is really precious in life and what you had better to do in some difficult situations .as i stated before , life has its own cycle and each part of it can be deeply enjoyed by everyone in different manner .i am actually wondering if older people enjoy life more than younger ones because of their experience .they might have get aware of what are the most important thinng in life and so they are supposed to suffer less than young people because of silly reasons .however , i think that this can only depend on each person different experience and especially on what he or she believe in .in fact , some people that have everything someone could desire are actually rather sad and others that keep having tough time turn out to be the happiest ones ..
