cars are very useful to us in many ways .they transport us to our destinations quickly .they help to save our time instead of walking .cars are widely used by millions of people around the world today .their price is not very high and they live for a long time .after mentioning all the useful uses of cars above , i totally disagree with the statement that says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i know that technology is becoming more and more progressive everyday and another invention could be invented , but the use on cars will not decrease .in my opinion , cars are very essential to every person now in the world .a person can not go to any place that he needs without a car .whoever does not own a car is obliged to ride in governmental or public cars such as buses and microbuses that transport individuals to certain places according to the destination of each bus .so at the end , the person rides a certain type of car and does not go to his destination walking as it will take a long time to reach his destination .in my second opinion , i think that in the next twenty years the uses of cars will increase as new and many features will be added to cars which give the opportunity for drivers to get greater benefit from cars .by that way , more cars will be used than today .for example , about 50-60 years ago , the cars that were used were very old-fashioned and were very large and some were moved by horses .now , everything has changed and cars became much mor good-looking .they became smaller in size and are no longer moved by horses .that is what i mean by adding new features .in conclusion , i totally disagree with the topic sentence and propose that the use on cars will increase and not decrease .
