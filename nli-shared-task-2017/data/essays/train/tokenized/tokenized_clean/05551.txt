recently , i am questioning myself in what age will i be able to enjoy my life .as a 23 year old university student , i came to the conclusion that older people enjoy life more than younger people .some people would think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do because they are young .however , the real enjoyment of life can not come in a young age .first of all , young people do not have enough achievements and experience to enjoy life .this may will sound strange to some people but in my opinion , to enjoy life , people have to have some kind of accomplishments .i consider enjoyment as an in-depth pleasure that comes out of achivements a person has made and from occurances that a person has experienced .partying all nights would not be considered as the real enjoyment of life .it can be a short time enjoyment but not in a long run .for example , this winter i met some old couples who have retired from their work when i was in cancun , which is a city in mexico .i could not forget the happy faces .i had some chances to talk to them and what i was told that they just started to enjoy their life which seemed hard to understand to me .what they were saying was that when they were young , they had so many things to worry , about the promotion in their work , their sons and daughters and so on .but now they know how to enjoy their life without worrying about the thinks that was considered to be important in their past .secondly , young people do not have much composure in mind to enjoy life .young people who are mostly considered students have to work and study days and nights for their future .they do not have enought time to look back and spend much time on their hobbies .but as people get older , people tend to spend more time for their own .there is somehting that my mother always says to me when i am slacking off .`` to enjoy your life when you get older , you have to sacrifice your youth .to conclude , even though it is hard to say that older people do enjoy life more than the younger people because there is not an exact boundary between old and young , i strongly believe that older people know how to enjoy their life because they have more achievements and experiences than the youngers have .to enjoy my life when i get older , i am working hard to build up a bright future .i hope that my belief that older people enjoy life more than younger comes true .
