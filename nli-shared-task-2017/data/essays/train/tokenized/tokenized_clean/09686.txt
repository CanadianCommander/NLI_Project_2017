the question about generalisation or specification is a very important topic because it is an ever lasting dicussion .my opinion on the question wether it is better to specialise or generalise is according to the generalisation , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in this text i will state my opinion by showing the advantages in private and office live .the first reason supporting my view is having the possibility to see more different aspects of a topic .imagine you are a leader of a firm .managing this firm means cooperation with different stakeholder who have different interests .when this manager now has a general knowledge in different academic subject he saves a lot of time by understanding what these stakeholder want from him .for example when you speak with researchers you know a few things they are talking about .second it is important to be able to combine different knowledge .this possibility enables you to solve a problem by your own .insted of always asking people from different sectors you may be able in some situations to get the solution by your own .this is also an aspect for saving money in a firm , by doing things on his own instead of outsourcing evert small task .the last reason for my opinion explains the advantages of broad knowledge in private live .having a large range of knowledge you are automatically interested in more things .being intersted in different things will help you to find more friends .and with these frindes it is possible to connect a network of reliable persons who will help you in the job or beside the job .these are a few reasons that follow my opinion to be better wide spread educated then having only a small range of view .you can gain a lot of advantages getting and using the knowledge out of many different academic sectors .
