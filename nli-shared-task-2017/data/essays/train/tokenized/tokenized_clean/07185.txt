as the saying goes `` rolling stone gathers no moss  .sucess lies in exploration involving risks .from the examples of the famous persons i infer that risks must be taken to achieve sucess .by keeping in view of the life history of many scientists sucess was achieved only by experimenting and not by just doing research on thier known ones .the electricity which is an essential part of our life was a fruit of experimenting .it is this experimenting which brings the sucess .we can take the life of few succesfull persons such as the world s richest man mr billgates and many more all of them were popular by trying out new ones rather than just doing what they know to do well .we can even cite the example of the famous sports icon saurav ganguly who was initially a football player but now he is famous for his cricketing capabilities .it is the experimenting of a new field which made him such a famous and sucessful person .great persons have achieved the glimpses of sucess by trying out various fields .late dirubai ambani has a vast empire and has establised himself as a gaint in many fields .he has a lot of determination too along with experimentation of his thoughts in various fields and attained sucess .if neil armstong did not take the risk of travelling on to moon he might never have been in our pages of history , he might have just ben passed away as an ordinary astronomer .one must not get disturbed when he fails in his attempt rather he must shift to another field and try his capabilities .our life is a short one and it needs to prove its worth .so we must acquire as much knowledge as possible in as many fields .but before trying out a new one we must learn some basic aspects of the field and know the keys to sucess in that field .as we all know failures are the stepping stones for sucess we must try out new things though there might be failures .so in this present generation sucess can be attained by trying out new things and taking the required risks .
