i really like to travel around the world .i can see a beautiful place taht i have ever seen and have a lot of valuable experiences .there are many kinds of styles when we go traveling .i can not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .to begin with , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has less time that we can spend free .most of these trips have very tight schedule .we have to see the famous place more quickly and we can not choose the gift for our friends or parents slowly .in my opinion , traveling should be more flexible and reluxing .in addition , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has little chance to happening .i think that happning is very important factor to enjoy trip .when i went to italy with my friend , i meet one italian chef in a bus by chance .we enjoyed talking and then we can eat italian foods in his house .it was very delicious .in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
