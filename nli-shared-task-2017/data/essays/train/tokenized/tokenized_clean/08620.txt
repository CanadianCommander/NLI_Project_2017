the cycle of life is amazing .a human is born weak and than gets to the zenith of his strength at one point than goes back to being weak as he approaches the end of his life .yet ask yourself this ?when does a person enjoy life the most ?in my humble opinion enjoying life means to have health , time in your life and the passion to learn which is what most old people lack .that is why young people enjoy life more than old people do .in order to enjoy life you need to have a great health .most young people that .they are strong and often do not suffer from many diseases as old people do .young people can jump scream and dance whenever they are happy .they are able to respond to their exitement through physical actions .however if an old person gets exited it s more likely for him to get a heart attack .it is very rare to see an old person able to jump up and down when exited .it s said that life is like a toilet paper .the sooner it gets to the end the faster it rolls .often do we hear old people talking about death as if it became a new friend they are ready to be escorted with as they leave the ballroom of life .old people put the idea that they do not have any more time in their hands wich makes them think there is nothing to be happy about .when i ask my grandma `` come up the stairs with me so we can watch the sunset  she would answer  no my dear , it s too late for me to do that .it s your time now .you go by yourself and enjoy it while you can ..my grandma just missed out the fun of gazing into the sunset because she thought that the stairs would kill her .young people dont worry about time .as far as they are concerned they should enjoy life while they still can !to me learning is one of the most excitting activities i enjoy .and when i say learning i mean learning from life .like having the suspence and wondering what will happen next .or where your life is going to take you .experiencing that the knowledge you know today is different from the knowledge you know tomorrow .old people will miss out on that excitting feeling because when they think about their future , atomatically a picture of a grave loads up in their mind .they say they have nothing to learn because they are in the final statges of life .therefore they lack the passion to learn .if you do nt have the will to learn than you will not learn .in conclusion , this does nt mean that all old people are miserable .it s really how the individual defines the phrase `` enjoying life  .to me if you do not have health , time and passion for learning i do nt believe you will be able to enjoy life .
