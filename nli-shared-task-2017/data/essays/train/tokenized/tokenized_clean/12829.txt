i agree somewhat and also disagree somewhat with the statement that successful peopletry new things rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .in the world , there are succesful peopie who are succeeding beacause they are not trying new things , but also there are people whpo are succeeding because they did start something new .i disagree because not every people who are sucessful has done new thing so they can become sucessful .for example , there may be some company that has succeded in the past with the current boss .if the current boss dies , his son may take in his position .his son has been living with his father for years , and so he knows how and what to do in the company to keep the company sucessful .i agree because of the unsucessful people that are trying to become succesful .unsucessful people will try more new things .the unsucessful people will try more new things , because he wants to succeed .if he keeps what he is doing now that is nt giving him success , he will come up with more new ideas that could lead hiom into a successful life .also , there are people who wants to start something new but they ca nt .like the son in the first example , he may want to start a new company , but he will not be able to , because he will have to start a new company while still keeping the current company succesful aswell .if he makes the current company unsuccesful , he has caused thousands of workers to lose there job , causing them to find new jobs .this makes the boss of a company think twice about starting a new business while currently having a successful company in progress .because he holds the lives of thousands of other workers , he can not just go off and start whatever he feels like starting .that is why i think that not every successful person tries new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
