i absolutely agree that the image of the product given by the communication ad is , in most of the cases , much better than how the product is in reality .for example let s take a campaign about pre-cooked food as roasted chicken : in the ad the chicken is always so beautiful , crispy and tasty .but once the product is in on your table . ..well the colour is maybe the same but the chicken is not tasty at all .actually it taste as plastic .another interesting example is a new mobile .the advertising states that the battery will last for several hundreds hours and the software will do incredible things for you .but in reality the battery charge will last for few hours only , two days maximum .the software will take ages to get ready and from time to time it will just be stucked for quite a long time .that is what happened to me with my new mobile .i guess if a product has to penetrate the market is has be shown as extremely appealing and absolutely new and fantastic .to convince someone to buy the product the commercial has to be very efficient , catch the attention and make grat , and fake , promises about quality and customer s satisfaction .so approaching the product customers will not only buy the product itself buth all the valuable things the commercial attached to it .i think there are so many me-too products , all looking more or less alike , that the marketing people are forced to rely on this kind of adverstising to make the people notice their product .for example computers from different firms all have the same features , someone has a bigger memory or screen or viceversa but none is really different .the real problem is that there are not enough differentiating values in products .even quality and the fact that they are really useful products is not enough anymore .
