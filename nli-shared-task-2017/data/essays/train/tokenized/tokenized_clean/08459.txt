life goes by every second of our lives .as a person gets older , not only his or her body is in constant deterioration , but also his or her mind , ideals , and thoughts .an elderly can hardly jump the rope or play football , but a teenager can accomplish those tasks with great facility .young people can practice a wide variety of activities with little or no limitations .from parachuting to eating a family-size pizza , the young are always on a better condition , mentally and phisicaly .therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do .this asserttion can be exemplified by a personal experience that i had with my grandfather when i was 14 and with today s wars .as a young teenager , i was always able to spend time with my grandfather .i felt a great respect towards him .yet , i was able to regard the differences between us .i ate hot-dogs and he vegetables .one day , when we went bowling , he felt on the middle of the lane while slowly throwing the ball .i panic at that time , but later i apprehended that not everyone is similar .i was able to discover and to realize that my grandfather could not have fun as easy as i could .his steps were slow and hardly-accomplished , while i ran in and out of the house .this experience let me to the belief that when one is old , it is no longer possible to enjoy life much .not only i have found experiences of myself for stating that young people enjoy life more than olders do , but society arrangement proves it by itself .the war that today affects some parts of the world is a clear and vivid example .very young people on the middle east are violentaly in combat .it is not neccessary a ` fun activity  , but rahter a way on defending their beliefs and their way of enjoying their life .it is not often to see a 70-year-old dead by combat means .the possibilities for a wide of spectrum of activities offered to young people aloud them enjoy the fascination of their lifes .life is short and our ` young lives  are even shorter .we should discover and take advantage of the inmense possibilities that we have as children and as young adults .years are limitants to our capabilities .run , jump , swim , and climb today !enjoy now and think later !
