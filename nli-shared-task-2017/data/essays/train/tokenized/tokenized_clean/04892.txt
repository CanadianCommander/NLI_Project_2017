i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in academy we can learn many subject .we can not have the chance to learn many academic subject without in academy .if you think you are nothing to do with an academic subject , it may be something to do with you .if you have not a knowledge of an academic subject when you need it , you have to be legret .the other advantige of have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that you can think many subject , more deeply , and more originaly .that is you can be superior to others .if you work on designer , for instance , you have to design many things .if you have knowledge of cyicology , you can design many things effectivity to anyone feel good .but you have no knowledge of cyicology , you can not design effectivity .in future , you can use many knowkedge of academic subjects which you do nt think need .however you have to learn major subject .major subject and the other subjects make you very billiant .
