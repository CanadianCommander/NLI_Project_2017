i think i am a kind of person who likes doing what i already know how to do well and i think i am a successfull person .but i well know some of my friends who become so successful by trying new things .but i think these people are not too much .there are good reasons to try new things and it must be excited to take risk in some situations .but i think people should concantrate in just one aspect and should do just one work in a best way .people can be successful only doing the work that already know how to do well .because you must spend some time and effort to learn new things .for instance i decided to learn playing viola at the beganing of the university instead of playing piano .i used to play piano when i was in primary school .i have never played viola before .therefore i was unsuccessful .if i had chosen to improve my ability in piano i am sure i would become more successful .i think this statement is more about the trade .because my father have a company and he prefer to do diffrent works regarding his own work .he always chooses to take risk .but sometimes he becomes successful and sometimes he does nt .i want him to go on doing he already do .because he is well aware of this work and also he has good experiences in this work .but there is no insurance in the new work .he does nt well know whether he will be successful .because of the reasons that i stated above , i do nt agree with this statement .according to my experiences i can say that , only the people who try to do things that they well know are successful people .
