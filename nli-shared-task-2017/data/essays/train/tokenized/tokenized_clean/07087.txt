i agree that successful people have the ability , the courage or the skills to go beyond what they already know and they are able to do , for trying out new and sometimes risky things .the history is itself full of examples of scientists , leaders or religious figures who gave a huge contribution to mankind by going further and passing the borders of what was known and widely accepted .their aim was finding out new ideas or new ways of doing things .in italy , in the 14th century for example , culture and science were still dominated by oscurantism and religion .the catholic church was very powerful and many scientists were prosecuted and killed because they used to profess dangerous ideas for the system .the world was believed to be flat and none was questioning this .it was then when columbus decided to move forward and , convincing the king of spain to supply him with three small vessels , he sailed into the unknown , towards west to seach for a new passage for reaching the far east .eventually he discovered a whole new continent .this is an example from history but also nowadays it is possible to see how people who look for what is undiscovered can be successful .we live in a knowldege economy and big and well established companies are often challenged by men and women who discover new ideas and lead the market towards what has nt been explored yet .an example is google , whose inventors shown a new way of using internet search for market purposes .therefore , in our daily routine , we should keep on looking for what is new and we have nt tested yet .we should not forget that taking risks is the way human beings develop or , in other words , like steve jobs , apple ceo said we should `` stay young , stay foolish !
