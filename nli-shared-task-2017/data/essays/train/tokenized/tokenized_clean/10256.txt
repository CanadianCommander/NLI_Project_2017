in my opinion , is more important for students , to understand ideas and concepts than learn or memorize concepts .when i was a kid , my sort of education was in a clasroom with my teacher and everyday memorized and memorized topics in spanish , mathematics and science topics .this kind of education is a traditional method because you go to the school to get knowledge through the experience and to understand why the things happen ?and not only to memorize 3 or 2 books and dates , for example in the history class is too common to memorize all the dates that happened in the second world war , and now tell if you remember some of them ? , sincerly i think your response will be : no .this is the problem , if in the school and maybe our parents had taught us , the importance to undertand why the things happen ?maybe , the young people at this moment wouldt have a lot of problems and would nt be upset for the school .if we know utopies about the educational system and theories for example for montessori or freinet , we can check that they taugh us that the education of a child ( in this case ) begins in the house and the school is a complement of the education and it is a place where the child development her or his motricity and intelectual forms based in understand ideas and not only in learn facts .other example is the piaget theory who told us , that the education is based in the experiences that you are getting along your life .now a days , the educational system already have changes in our country for example the use of internet , in order to make easier to undertand the knowledge and an opportunity for young generations to be succesfully in any area .my conclusion is the following : you have to learn everything that you need but is better to undertand , everything that you want .
