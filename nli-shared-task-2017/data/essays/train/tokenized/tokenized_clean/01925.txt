today , governments try to reduce the use of personal cars .it is easy to support this observation by following the investments made for both new public transportation methods and recent developments in technology .there are various reasons for trying to reduce the use of personal cars .the reduction in power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are the main reasons to try to reduce the use of cars .recent studies show that , in thirty years , the resources of fuel oil will finish .since fuel oil is an important source that is used in many other important industries , the price of fuel oil will dramatically increase over time .this will automatically make people think about the alternatives such as public transportation , bikes or any other cheap device .the use of cars increased very much in the last twenty years .one of the biggest disadvantage of this increase was the air pollution .scientists believe that , the ozone layer is seriously damaged with the increase of car usage .since this gives serious harm to nature , governments will need to take decisions to reduce the use of cars in the future .today most of the big cities have a traffic problem .it is easy to observe the effect of increase of car usage on the traffic .governments try to solve traffic problem with several alternatives .the most willing alternative is to increase the use of public transportation .nowadays , extra taxes are required from personal car owners in order to reduce the use of personal cars .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .lack of power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are main reasons why there will be fewer cars in use in the future .
