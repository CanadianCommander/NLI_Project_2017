i do believe successful people try new things and take risks .i believe life is full of opportunities that can benefit us , but we have to be ready and willing to accept this opportunities .if a person just sits around and keeps doing the same than his/her life will become in a rutine .risks are always good because they motivate the person and makes a person give it s best to achieve it s personal goals , it s always good to try new things .a person has to look at it in a way that if nothing comes out of this than its not a lost , its actually a win , because you earned experience .experience is a very valuable gift a person acquires over time .nobody is born with experience , life gives a person the experience required to become successful and not fail .successful people have already obtained a certain degree of experience that has taken them to the spot they are located at .a good example of how experience helps and is acquaired would be that a guy recently graduated with a business major , would nt be able to run a company by itself .he probably has the knowledge , but not the experience to know what to do , or what decisions he needs to take , or how the company is run .important personalities in life have taken risks .one good example is cristopher columbus .he took the risk of sailing through the ocean , because he had a dream that the earth was round , and not flat like everybody said it was .he took that risk and he had a great outcome , he found america .if he would sat around and just believed what everybody else was believing in and just traveling in the same route everybody was , than he would nt have never found the glory he found when he decided to take that risk .life is full of risks , and we have to be well prepared in order to confront them , and when they come we do nt have to be afraid of taking them because we do nt know what we might found or the outcome of them will be .a person wont become successful just wishing and dreaming they were successful , what they need to do is get up and go out and overcome all types of adversities .
