i think it is better to apply a combined approach so that students can obtain a broad perspective about the world with a special insight into certain dynamics .first of all , through developed from different origins , knowleges are intricately connected today .if you want to make yourself specilized on the subject of biology .you need the knowledge from physics : the microscope to see the internal sturcture of cell ; you also need the knowledge from chemistry to understand the underlying mechanism of the cell s operation ; besides , to know how biology science can be better benift human being , you need the knowledge from medicine , ethnics , and even bussiness , considering that you want to sell you biological medicine to customer , you even need the knowledge of international politics as big biology project such as human gene research requires the coorperation amone nations .as a result , it is advisable that you should first gain a broad knowledge in advance and then make your concentration on speical subject .second , without a special focus on special subject , one can hardly successed .that myself for examlp , when i was a freshman in university , i tempted to absorb as much as knowledge as i can , but finally i found that i was not skilled in any special subject at all , i just know a general idea of every knowledge without went deeper in them .it is after i adjust my learning mean so that i succeed in a the essay competiton which apply special knowlege on the background of a broad knowledge .in conclusion , both broad knowledge and special knowledge are needed and it pays to find a balance way to combine broad knowledge with special insight .
