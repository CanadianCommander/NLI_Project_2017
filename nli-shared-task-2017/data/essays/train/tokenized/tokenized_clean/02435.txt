i disagree to the statement that young people today give less time to helping community .i myself form a relevant example .i am twenty-seven years old and have been actively involved in community service for the past six years now .i have taken up various types of projects .i have given lectures in health camps organized for the slum dwellers .i have organized blood donation camps with the colleagues at my workplace .while i was in gemany , i tutored english to students and job-seekers from various parts of the world who had come to germany for studies and work but could not afford the costly language school .being an electrical engineer , i have volunteered to teach professional courses of electrician , to help people make a living for themselves .currently i am working with a project for rural women .i am organising this project in order to build expertise in rural women to take up small tasks which can help them earn a living and also rear the traditional rural art of cooking , stiching , embroidery , etc .and it would not at all be strange to reveal that all the activities that i have mentioned above have been done in groups of fellow young students and professional .i name us all `` philanthropic enthusiasts  .i have seen people from different backgrounds joining hands to improve the society around .and whenever i have asked the amateurs about the reason behind their interest for community , i have got the same answwer .that they all get a strange satisfaction in these volunteer activities .this feeling of fulfillment fills the void in their lives which is created by the day to day struggle at university , office , personal relationships , etc .in fact , i feel that young people today are more active than they were a decade ago .this may in turn be to some part attributed to the education system across the globe .schools and universitites today mandate that a particular number of hours per week be spent in community service .this madate helps student learn the advantages of such work and in the process they start loving it .they also realise that how the volunteer work serves dual purpose , of enhancing the community and the individual as well .
