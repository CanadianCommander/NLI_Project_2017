i disagree with this statement , as i beleive that the older people enjoy life more than young people do because older people have the independence , experience , and the growth mind abilities .first of all , it is important factor to determine the person ability to enjoy life is the independency of this person .the independency means the ability to take and perform decissions , and it is almost known that the older people have much independency than young ones .it is obstacle for any person to enjoy without having the needed independecy to make his decissions .in addition , the vast experience that the older have through their lifes will provide them with the ability to take the best decissions that will surely led them to more enjoy of the life .the last thing is the growth mind that the older people have .it is fact that the person mind and his intelectual abilities become more and more with the life time .this is somethimg any person vave to have in order to enjoy his or her life .finally , i found my self enjoying my time better and better while growing and become older .remembering the passed events i wish i had the independence , experience , and the mind abilities to behave better than i had , that could make may more enjoyable .
