man is a social animal .from the time being mankind had appeard on this earth , the real man is contiously trying to achieve maximum of knowledge in order to attain the ultimate peak of success and power .for this many ways had been organised by us and one of the most important way to do this work is to attain excellence in science , research , arts and technology .th topic of discussion here is that whether it is better to have broad konwledge of many acadmic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .in my point of view , i can thoughfully say that it is good to have only one subject to keep in concern than to deal with many areas of acadmic studies .first of all , to live in society where educated people recide it is important for each one of us to have the minimum required knowledge of all the subject which could be of essential use for our future .for this i would like to take an example which about a child who wants to becom a pilot and has always studied physical sciences amd maths and no other thing .but now , how can he communicate with others , to feel others and to show his feeling towards others , to mix and organise things related to the world of other subjects .so this is cumpulsory for all of us to attain a minimum amount of knowledge about all the things so that our life moves on smoothly .but , i would lay more stress on the fact that one should be more specific about the subject or the area of study when one is going though his higher studies .the main reason behind this is that , now in this accelerating world we ca nt excell in an area or field unless we are very specific in that work .the other main here is that if we are specific we can show our complete effort in a particular field and can serve the society in best way we can and this is th omly thing required for excellence in all the fields .as a conclusion the best way to move is to be specific together having required intrests in all other ares also .
