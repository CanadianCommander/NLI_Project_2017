i agree with the statement , `` successful peolpe try new things and take risks rather than doing things what they already know how to do well  .i believe that successful people are the ones , who have reached new heights and a stage which others believe is difficullt and hard to obtain .the idea of being new has always attracted the crowds and only sustained for short time .if it was not appealing for a long time .i believe that successful people have always tried to keep the concept of new alive by taking risk and sustanining for long period .the idea of taking risks to succed has always been repeated in history and in present .for example grays , the persons who has written the book of human antomy .ages ago , during his time it was considerd a sin to dig the corpse and study on it and was not allowed .he with the passion has risked to go to the graves at night and dig the corpse and get it to his lab and work on it , his book of anatomy is considerd even today the best book of human anatomy ever written .thus , making him a successful person , this only happened as he has taken the risk of trying new things than being convential .sticking to old medicine taught to him at that time .history has repaeted this kind of examples over and again , for example a buisness man named mithal , one of the richest person in the world and an owner of the largest steel industries in the world .he hailed from a family which was very poor and was taught to do buisness only in a small scale but with an envision of new concepts he risked to buy a small steel industry and after that with a new concept of not making a stell industry , insted aquiring industries which are not doing good buisness in the form of colabration has led him to become the owner of largest buisness in the world .this is only possible by taking a risk of applying a new concept with a vision .the idea of taking risk and being successful has alsways been constanly rewarding to all the succesful people .thus i strongly belive that a person taking a risk with agood vision would succed and become a successful person than by sticking to what he knows .
