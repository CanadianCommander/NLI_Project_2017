the humankind always need to buy supplies , meterials or food to live .advertisements are playing a big part in people s choises of buying food , materials or supplies .there is lots of arguments about the topic which we are discussing about .some people assumed that while advertising something you always have to describe the quality of something .in that case they think that advertisors is always telling the truth .but some of us thinks that advirtisors are not saying the truth about something they advertise .i agree with the second idea .i have very important reasons and examples to prove it .these are my following reasons .firstly , advirtisors are not telling the truth because they want to eleminate the prize factor .for example , if i were an advertisor and if my products are very expensive , i will describe the qualities of the product and i will never talk about the prize .and sometimes i will not tell the truth about my product .so people will think that product is in high quality , it is normal that product is expensive too .in adittion to this , advirtisors want to advertise their company .they show their products much better than they really are , to advertise their company .so people will believe that the company is good enough to product this value of products .in that case people will always choose this companie s products .the last but not the least , sometimes advertisors lie about the prize too .they are making complicated sales and advantages to sell the product .but usually in this sales and advantages people are buying item or product much more expensive .in this situations , advertisors always mixing our head .all in all , i would like to say that advirtisors are not telling the truth both of eleminating the prize factor , advertising their company as well as to make complicating sales and advantages .
