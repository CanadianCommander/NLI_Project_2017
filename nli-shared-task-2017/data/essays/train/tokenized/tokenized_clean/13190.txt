the situation of learnning simplely but deeply or widely is a thing depends on the time .i m really not agree with only judging it by good or bad .human s life is a long time , sometimes we should do something , but some other times maybe we need other things .in one s undergraduate time , it is fit to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .thus you have four or even three years to study in university , and also you are young .you have the spirit to explore the unclear things and fill in your mind .it will let you do well when you face to social , as you have more theory knowledge and special experience .the enviroment of the university is good for learn more thing .there has lots of excellent professor , and you can exchange your opinion with your classmates .for example , if you are comparing to make a design which is about geogerophy , how will adverse your boss to use your design ?but if you have a knowledge background about the geogerophy , you will do better .after graduating from university , if you want to go on developing youself , you had better to specialize in one specific subject .at that time , you have less time , and you must think about your life and how to offer your family .the fact will tell you that you should do something more deeply , as your spirit is limited .another reason is no one can do lots of things in the same time .if you want do the best , you should pay more attention on what you are doing .just like we ca nt choose both sleep and eat .broad knowledge is a wonderful thing , but we ca nt control all of them in fact .specialism sometimes looks like boring .what you will do depends on youself .
