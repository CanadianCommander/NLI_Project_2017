in our today s modern world , we are invaded by cars .cars are everywhere creating big problems for the envrionment .there are no more spaces to park his vehicle , they pollute the environment so much that it is hard to breath sometimes , but still , their number is increasing .i do not agree with the statment that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in my essay , i will talk about the influence of the economic s growth , the new technologies , and the importance of transportation .in modern societies the economie increases which also improves people level of life .people having a higher level of life is translated by receiving higher incomes , in other words people have more money .a family with low incomes will purchase only one car to fit their needs , however if the same family receives higher incomes , it gives them the possibility to purchase an another car etc . ..that is why today in modern societies , we only see one driver for one car .with higher level of life , people are purchasing more vehicles .an increasing economie allows to spend more money in reasearch of new technologies .by purchasing more cars , you give the ability to the manufacturer to gain benefits to improve their product .a google example today is the japanese company toyota , they created a hybrid model , which in short allows the costumer to save fuel and to pollute less .to create new technologies , researcher needs money to be able to advance .the vehicle s market is on a growth slope , and every new model of cars shows a technologie improvement .as far as human s history is known , transportation has always been important .the world today is not closed , boundaries are opened and always need to reach different point in this world .it has always been for economical reason .for example , a person works in a big city but can not afford to live inside the city .this same person will buy a place outside the city .to be able to reach her work from her home she will need transportation .at first it was walking , then bicyle but the person is looking for a faster way therefore she buys a car .the car is not safe so she will purchase a safer car , and so on . ..transportation is very important for us .purchasing new cars give the ability to the manufacturer to improve their vehicle .i do not agree that there will be fewer cars in the twenty years .the growing economie is allowing the cars to improve therefore will we have better , safer and even more cars on our road .
