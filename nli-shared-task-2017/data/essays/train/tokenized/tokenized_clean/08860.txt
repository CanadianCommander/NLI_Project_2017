i disagree this statement ,but i think that this idea is not totally incorrect .in twenty years the things changes and i dontt know how we will travel with .the todays cars are a very important problem because the car create a lot of air pollution .the cars are the most pollution producers on the earth .in this case i think that people in future wants to change theyre abituds and so travel with a different transport ( train for example ) .but i think that in twenty years cars changes too .i see a not pollution cars use a clean energy and the problem of pollution will be stopped .my preoccupation is about the number of people that in twenty years can becameing too much for travel with cars .what that i think is that in the future can persist only the taxy and the bus because the spaces will be full in the streets .people will travel most with airplane because the journey will be longer than at present .my wish is that we find a solution for the air pollution and not only obviusly , and i dream a modern wonderful cars go with a particular new energy discovered from a new particular planet .i think it was possible .the solution if the people wants is behind the corner .i have studied for became a designer and i want to se cars forever and in my rouls i want to understand what is possible to do for resolve the cars pollution problem .the problem of air pollution in twenty years becaming a very very serious problem .there are now a new solution with new engines wich go with gpl or new oil
