the mentioned statement discusses the number of cars in the future and thus , it needs to be critically considered .when the production of cars started they were only luxury things for people that were able to spend a lot of money .but after a couple of time scientists developed cars that were available for everyone .from there on the industry for cars was growing and growing .today cars have material and immaterial values for human beings .some people only need the car to be flexible and they love it for its comfortness .other people love the cars for their special surface etc .cars are determining human beings in so many ways that no one could imagine to live without them .but cars have also negative effects , especially on the environment .because of the air pollution the governments want the people to reduce the car use .some cities have an alarming air pollution caused by the cars .thus , in the future a restriction should help to decrease the pollution .but would this cause a reduction of the cars in use ?in some ways this will be practicable because some cities do not allow its citizens to drive within the city .this surely reduces the cars in use .but not only environemental reasons can cause a reduction of the cars in use .especially the booming development of airplanes and fast traines decreases the use of cars .today people are able to get cheap flights which bring them faster to another point in the world than a car would .airplanes and fast traines offer the customer to travel a long distance in a short time and furthermore , in a comfort and cheap way .as oil prices are contantly rising a normal human being has great costs to travel by car .thus , airplanes and trains are accomodate alternatives to cars .concerning the mentioned arguments i can support the statement .in my opinion there will be fewer cars in use due to the alternative mediums - airplanes and traines .but this will not cause a reduction of cars , but only a reduction of the use of the cars .
