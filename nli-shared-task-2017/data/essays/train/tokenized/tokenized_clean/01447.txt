in general , to master of lots academic subjects is a good way to have a broad knowledge and might have a good carrier starting in the future .so many people like to broaden their knowledge in taking many academic subjects , but others do not want to .i prefer to make more subjects to advance my knowledge for a few reasons .first , it is not a knid of easy to enter a university , once entering a university , it provides a good chance to get more subjects than others cnnot have a chance to enter the university .if you take more subjects you would become more respomsible and more organize the timing .i took many subjects on the same semester so i make a wise schedule for myself , and i fell kinds of satisfiy by myself .thus , i think its a good ways to take more subjects to broaden knowledge .second , i could advance by meslef in other objects and help people in taking more subjects , for example , i do not need to take a course of medical beacuse i am major in agriculture , but i encourage myself to brave to take it , and then , my roommate got a bacteria infection in the midnight and i immediately to get a right medicine to help her to reduce the pain and then sent her to the hospital .miracially , i finally became a nurse because i love to help people and make them good healthy .for all of that , i do not mean my though was totally right , but i really enjoy and happy by myself in taking lots subjects in university .it is a good way to obtain knowledge and have a productive life .
