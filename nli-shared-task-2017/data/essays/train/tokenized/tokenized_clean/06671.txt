some people beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people do .others beleive that older people enjoy life more than young people .i beleve that young people enjoy life more than older people , i have some points suggests my opinion .first , young people have healthier bodies than older people and this helps young people to reveal the world by traveling every year to a new country with a new adventures while older people do not have the ability to travel too much so they prefer staying at home .second , somebody may say that older people can do whatever they want their sequence days because they are retired from their works so they are not busy .but still young people beside working and getting tired they can go outside every day like shopping going restaurants enjoy playing many sports like tennis , soccer , and basketball .young people s life is so interesting while the older people are so boredthird , young people have the ability to read more and to reveal new knowlege , while most of the older people must wear glasses and sometimes they get confused to read the words and to see them clear .also the older people are more angry and nervous while the young people are not .sadly , every individual will grow and rise till the death , i mean that the young people will reach the level of eldness , so i advise the young people to enjoy their life before getting older .
