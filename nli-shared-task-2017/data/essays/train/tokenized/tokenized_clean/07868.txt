there are many possibilities for young people to help their communities .they could engage in policies , give sports lessons , take part in the red cross or be active in their church .but , in fact , there are quite few people who actually do some of these things .what are the reasons for this ?one point could be that young people feel little responsibility for their community .they have to think so much about themselves , about how to plan their life and how to organize their career , that thinking about others seems not to fit in .they just live according to the sentence `` if everybody thinks of themselves , it is thought of everybody  .one should not call all of them unfair , some of them are simply overwhelmed by all the things they have to manage in their own life , so that they can not concentrate on others .and for some of them there simply is not much time to engage for other things than for school or for university .many students i know have to work very hard to be successful in their field of study , so that there is only little time to concentrate on other things .the time they have , they prefer using to meet friends or just to relax .on the other hand , not engaging in ones community is , of course , very comfortable .knowing that there are people who do the work makes many people think : `` well , why me if they do it so well ?and one may not forget that for many people there is not much that they regard to be worth to engage for .most young people in our society live quite well , they have chances for their future , the society they live in is shaped by a stable democracy .why fighting or engaging for something if everything seems alright ?another point i consider to be influencing is , that many young people would like to engage in their communities , but they just do not know how or who to ask .perhaps approaching students and proposing possibilities would make them think about getting active in their community .on the other hand , one should not forget all the young people who really sacrifice much time and nerves to serve their communities .there are always people engaging in a school or in different clubs who offer their talents and also their time for so many other people .so one should not forget to regard the stament in an appropriate way .
