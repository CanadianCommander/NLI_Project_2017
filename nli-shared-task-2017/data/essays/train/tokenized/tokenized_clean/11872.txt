i disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think that people can enjoy if they have enough ( i ) money , ( ii ) time , and ( iii ) physical power to enjoy their hobbies or things which they are willing to do .with respect to ( i ) money , it is the many cases that young people do not have enough money to enjoy their reasure time .on the other hand , older people have enough money to use for their fun .honestly speaking , my father have more money than i have .older people have deposited their earned money from their long time s working .and there is the national pention system in our countory , so older people do not have to spend their own money to live and they can get enough money from such pention system today .with respect to ( ii ) time , young peopele have lots of things to do , such as study , work , and local activities .in my case , i am working more than 200 hours a month , in order to get money required to pay back to a bank ( i borrowed some money for buying my house . ) .so young people do not have enough time to enjoy their hobbies .with respect to ( iii ) physical power , the physical power of young people is higher than that of older peopel .but according to the articles i read in a magazine , older people s physical power is getting higher and higher in accordance with the development or inovation in the medical business .so older people today have enough power to enjoy their hobbies like young people do .from above mentioned , i must state that older people enjoy life more than young people .
