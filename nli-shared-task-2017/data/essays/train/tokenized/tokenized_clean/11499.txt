when it comes to car use , the tendency seems to be upward sloping and that is why i believe that twenty years from now , there will be more cars than there are today ; but i believe that cars wont be the same as they are today .within the past fifty years , the number of cars has grown drastically worldwide .if we take a look back in time we can easily realize that during the 1950 s families were accostumed to having one car if any per household , while today , on the other hand , most families tend to own two cars .this growth pattern could have been caused by changes that have taken place in society such as the incorporation of more women to the labor force , but the truth is that today we have more cars than we used to .therefore , it seems reasonable to expect a continuous increase in the number of automoviles within the next twenty years .it is true that car use keeps incrementing , but it is also true that now people are more concious of the environmental problems than they were before , and that is why reforms are being put in place in order to reduce car use .such reforms include high parking rates and taxes on big automoviles , such as jeeps .while these reforms seem harsh , the number of cars has not been decreased substancially and that is why i believe that the tendency will continue to be upward sloping .on the other hand , while i believe that automoviles will keep increasing , their manufacture will have to be more environmentally concious and that is why cars will not be the same as they are today .a possible change which seems to work is the use of hydroelectric engines ( engines which are electrically powered ) .these vehicules utilize water tanks in order to generate motion .another posibility is incorporating sun pannels in cars , just like the ones which are now used in homes in order to obtain energy from the sun s rays .both these technologies , are less pollutant than the technology implemented in regular cars and that is why it seems reasonable that new cars will implement one of these two .in conclusion , i believe that the number of cars will continue to grow during the next twenty years , but i also understand that the situation is unsustainable as it is today and that is why car technology will have to change drastically in order to protect our planet from pollution ; therefore , cars will have to change .
