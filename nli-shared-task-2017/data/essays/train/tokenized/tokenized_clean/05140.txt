i do agree with the statement reported below for the following reasons :1. as i personally experinced in my academic history , facts are not easy to remember for a long time .this was expecially true when i had to study a lots of subjects at the same time for my exams , after a week or two i could no longer remember most of the facts i learned but on the over end i can still remember the ideas and concepts .a good example is related to my history class , i can not rember all the data or the facts that occured during the modern history , but i can still remember the ideas and the concepts that have been expressed in those time .2. ideas and concepts that you learn in class when you are a student are more usefull in the real life when you are not a student anymore .you can apply them not only in the subjects in which you have learnt them , but also to different areas .this is not possible with facts that actually can be applied only to the subject they are related to .3. students through the studing of ideas and concepts have also the great possibilty to improve themself by learning a new way of thinking and by having the chance to learn new concepts which have been experinced by great persons ( e.g.historical persons , scientists , etc . ) .expecially in this period of time in which young people follow wrong ideas expressed through the modern comunication system ( e.g. media , internet , radio , etc ) .finally , for the reasons expressed above i think that concepts and ideas are more important than facts , for a better future for our students .
