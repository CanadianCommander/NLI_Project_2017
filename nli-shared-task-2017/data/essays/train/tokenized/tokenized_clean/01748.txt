i agree with the statement .first of all , every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people .because they ve found a way to get richness and success while orthers are still stay poor in either their money or their futures .successful people usually think differently .for instance , an average person who makes about 50 thousand dollars a year would probaby save 10 to 20 thousand dollars in their banks .what a successful person would do is using the money to invest onther than put that much money into bank .that s how a small amount of money gets larger and larger .successful people think things in advance .they look at the market and they would know what hot deals are going on .they would find out which you can and which you can not do .they would figure out which worthes the risk to invest .in another words , they have the intellegence to distinguish good stuff and bad stuff .any way , successful people are usually business man .my friend john is a stock bloker who works on wall steet .he makes money only out fo look at how the stock goes .he usually works at home , seldom go out .but he knows every thing .he gets information from the internet .he s just more than intellegent .once he knows what the stock would go , he knows for sure .he s just like genius .successful people are bave .they would try things new , not afraid of the unkown future because they have the courage and the confidence to do their job good .the know the will finally win the game and make their life better .for example , my uncle lee is a very successful person .he makes a fortunes every year .he s always glad to try some new stuff even some of them are for teens .but he s already 50 .he s brave , not afaid of anything .
