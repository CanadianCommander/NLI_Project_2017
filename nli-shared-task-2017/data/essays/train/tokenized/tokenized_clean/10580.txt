i m agree with the statement above , because usually the companies want to have more costumers and they start the publicity for this .they just show in commercials the best things of their products , but they do nt give the costumer all the true .for example if you go to a fast foods restaurants , they have meals cheaper than meals that you can find in other kinds of restaurants .it s true it s cheap meal , but also is small , and it can affect the health of the costumer , because its nutritional facts will can damage the regular system of the body in the future .in other hand , if you go to the clothes store , obviously you want to see the best and the cheapest dress that they have , but the problem is , in some cases , that they do nt have your size , the clothes there is just for thin women and you ca nt wear it .they just show the price and how beautiful is the dress but they do nt say that the clotes in this store is just for `` unreal women  .i think that the owner of this types of companies are also costumers , and for this , they have to think like that .if they want more costumers , more sales , so more money , they have to know exactly what the `` real people  need to wear , to eat , or just to live healthy .i come from another country and the first time when i realized the way of i ll have to live my life here , i thought `` i m going to have many problems  , because in my country the life is slower than here , and we have time to think about ourselves .we have some more time to cook , to have a good times with our friends , but we also are more lazy than american people and just think about the party time .i think because american people do nt have enough time for cook or do differents things , they make everything easiest for everyone , and is why they just show the best of their products with do nt care about the things that can cause a damage ( the fry meal ) to the costumers .
