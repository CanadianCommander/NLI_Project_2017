many peole enjoy their lives and they all have differnet ways to fulfill it .enjoyment that young people can get from their lives is so much bigger and astonishing .old people can never enjoy their life as much as young people do because of their surroundings and age .the old think too deeply for what they do compared to young people .i am 18 years old now and i do not think much when i do something , which makes me enjoy my life more .young people often do what they want without thinking about the consequences it might cause .for the old , they always think about the result of what they do since they always have to take a responsibility in any situation .that makes their lives even more boring that it already is .as an example if you are a father of two young children , you have to nuture them by earning money and offering them many educational stuff .you always have to think about your childen .even if you want to give up your job and find some other job that you can actually enjoy , you just can not , for it is a big risk for you to give up your job .young people might have something to worry about but they can do what they want without being in a postion where they have to support someone so the change that young people can enjoy their lives is much greater than the old .as people grow older the abilities of their body can not but help being decreased .in nine cases out of ten old people are weak comapred to young people .they can not be as active as those young people who play soccer and basketball every day .as an example you are 60 years old man who has a son .one day you follow your son to take a walk .all of a sudden you son starts to run fast .it goes without saying that you can not follow him since you are old .it is something that you can not control ; as you get older your body is weakened .old people might have a great desire for doing new , but to do that they need to be in a good shape .in a word , they have to be healthy which is really difficulty for most old people .but for young people they are always active and they do not get tired easily since they are young .they have more chances to enjoy new things that they have never tired in their life before , which makes their life more intereting and exciting .some of old people might feel miserable as they get older and they are likely to find out that their life seems to be boring compared to young people .but they always have to keep something in their mind , which is everything actually depends on their attitude towards something .they can change their life in a better or a worse way .young peole might enjoy their lives more than the old ; however , that does not mean the old can not enjoy their lives .they need to stay postive and find some ways to be more enjoyful .
