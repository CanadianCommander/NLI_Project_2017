happiness is an interesting issue : do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?well , from my experience , i believe that older people are in a better position to enjoy life nowadays than young people .first , let s take an example .a lot of people may say `` living on an island in a warm place , far from the stress life of big cities , is like heaven.  and they add `` people who live in such place do not know the chance they have  .this example illustrates a major point : no one can appreciate his life when he has never experiment a hard situation .older people , from their experience , have an idea of the difficulties of life and when they decide to do something , they know how to enjoy it .people tend to enjoy more when they know things are not so easy to get .for instance , a child who uses to get expensice gifts does not know how hard her parents have worked to get their social situation .but if he makes things by her own , she would like them even more because she remember the difficulties and time she went through .second , nowadays , life is getting tougher for young people .because of today s economic and political situation , life beomes much more stressful for young people who have to make create their social situation .unemployment rate is high in a lot of countries like france and germany and young people have more difficulties to find jobs .moreover , because of globallization , companies have to face competition from the entire world .this situation leads to costs reduction in the majority of companies and a need to make profits .thus , young people have to face pressure coming from everywhere .they are not in a position to take time to enjoy life , because for a lot of them , they have to work , work , and work , and sometime rest .the situation is clearly different for older people .they are retired for some of them and they do not have to face all this pressure .they can spend more time on their passion and extra professional activities .third , the situation for older people is much better than one of those a hundred years ago .older people benefit from social enhancement .health care and health system have improved , and the life span has increased a lot in rich countries .people live longer today .thus , older people have more time for themselves .how about young people ?well , as said before , their new stressful life is not favorable for a healthy life .look at the amount of medication to reduce stress spent every year by young people !a research has shown that the best time to have a baby is ...retirement .
