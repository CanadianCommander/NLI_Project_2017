i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .when i was in korea , i took a trip with my family .we traveled japan .we were in a group led by a tour guid .they helped us a lot .first of all , we could nt speaking japanese , and we did nt know direction of their location .also , we worried if there is dangerous thing goes around city .however , we got a tour guide with our group member .she took us a lot of place that we did nt know before .also she took us a lot of popular place in japan and restaurant .we had a good time with our tour guide .they help people to enjoy their trip , also they are so helpful if we get in trouble with foreign language .secondly , if we travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can meet a lot of people as a group member .as we travel in a group , we were in the group with other family members .they also loved travel in a japan .we shared beauty of japan with us .a tour guide led us popular place and we took a lot of great picture from there .it made me one of beautiful memory .finally , a tour guide teach us to view world widly .they tell us and teach us different culture and different costume .they were not like teacher , but it seems more comfortable when i learn about different contry and their culture in the class .it makes me more enjoyable and more interesting .also it helped me to view world widly .i m getting more interest in other different country .i wish i could visit all of the place in the world .a tour guide makes people to learn different culture comfortably .it s really enjoyable when we travel in a group led by a tour guide .as travel in a group led by a tour guide , more safety and more enjoyable than when we travel by ourselves .we can learn different culture easily than by alone .it helps people to getting more interesting in different culture and country ,
