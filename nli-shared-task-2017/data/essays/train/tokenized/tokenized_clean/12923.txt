on the one hand , it s of course important to have a broad knowledge on many subjects because with a broad general culture it s possible to feel more concerned about more subjects , to exchange different points of view with many people because the morre the culture is high , the more you can share conversations with different people .a high general culture allow pople to develop theirself , to feel more secure when they are talking about something . ..but on the other hand , having a wide culture about only one subject has the advantage that people know on what they are talking about .in some professions like archeologists , historians , physicians . ..the people have a huge knowledge on their subject which can be very impressive .furthermore , in some professions like doctors , plane driver . ..it s important that these people know what they are doing and they know their job by heart . ..also , we can remember famous people such as einstein , freud , mozart . ..because they almost specialized their life on something , and they allow us to improve with their knowledge , teaching us new things that they couldnt have done if they did nt spend a lot of time on it .my opinion is that i prefer specialize on a specific subject because i think knowing a few things on a lot of subjects could be superficial knowledge .but of course if i specialize on something it does nt mean that i ll have no interest in other subjects .for example for me it s very important to know what happens in the world , to have interest in history but i specialized myslef since a long time on guitar .but i think it s a pleasure to know a lot about something , to be able to argue on a subject because you know it well .but of course , to specialize on a subject , it has to be a passion .
