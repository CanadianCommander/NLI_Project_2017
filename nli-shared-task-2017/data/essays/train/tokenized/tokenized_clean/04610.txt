in turkey , almost 45 % of total population is composed of young people .if there is a problem about young people , that causes big problems to be solved .nowadays , it is believed by most of the population that , young people do not give enough attention on their communities .first of all , it must be accepted that there is a problem about young people and tried to be solved .especially in turkey , we can not see any young people when some problems about social life or country are discussed .youngs think that `` these are unnecessary subjects and can not be solved by us  which is completely wrong .people are effected by various source of communication device such as tv , radio , mobile phones , etc .in the programs , it is always mentioned that being a rich person in an unfair and quick way is the best way .youngs do not want to study any more because of these programs .second , student population is very high in turkey .they are highly concentrate on their primary job which is finishing the school in an acceptable time .problems about social life and country do not bother them any more .education system makes students only `` living memorizer  instead of a researcher or a confident person .how can we expect a young boy/girl to be confident if he/she is grown up under pressure of his/her parents or teachers ?finally , reading habit is very low in young generation .it can be seen not to be related to this subject in the first sight but the more you read the more you know and if you do not know , you can not discuss or help .as a result , young generation is effected by some external factors and forced to believe and live in such a lazy and slave life style .the situation is valid for today but should be worked on it .turkish culture and traditions must be told young generation instead of the west world s .
