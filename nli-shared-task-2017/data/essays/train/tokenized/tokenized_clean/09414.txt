the issue of whether or not it is more important for students to understand concepts than to learn facts is a controversial one due to its influence on today student s education .on the one hand , learning without understanding is claimed to lead to make students only ` wise monkeys  .on the other hand , the current twenty or so generation is said to know far less than former generations and hence should largely learn class content by heart .on my opinion , i agree with the statement above and consider that understanding is a prerequiste to learning .the first argument in favor of my position is that understanding is a real reflexion while learning may be seen as a deshumanized task .if school education has to build tomorrow brains , it seems important that they can understand what they have been taught .the movie ` rainman  can be taken as an example : the story is about a very smart man , able to compute how many matches fall out of a box in seconds , but unable to communicate with the world surrounding him .students learning large amount of facts without being able to understand basic ideas could be seen as future experts jailed in a very narrow mindset .then , it has to be noted that leibniz is said to have been the last man knowing every field of knowledge .in the current century knowledge has become so vast that it seems hardly impossible to know everything in a specific field .one life is often not long enough for a specialist to lead all the research he wanted to .hence , it makes more sense to make students able to think with concepts they understand than full of knowledge they do nt even know how to combine the different elements .eventually , creativity is essential to cope with an unknown situation .while students knowing many facts could in a sense recreate learnt solutions , students having understanding concepts and ideas could be more apt to deal with the unknown and to fit an acceptable solution to the problem they cope with .as a conclusion , i think that understanding is a prerequisite to an intelligent learning .the former may not really be separated from the latter but i think that wise advises and concepts are much more useful for the mind than a huge amount of data .
