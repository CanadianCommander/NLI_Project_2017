i think the most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are .they make the ad or tv commercials intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of products .typical example is , i think , an advertisements of car .one commercial that i felt like i missed the poing was the one ; a man at the groccary casher looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to .he got vegitables and a pack of big in tofu in his cart and the other man has huge bulk of beef .after that he rushes into a car dealere and buys a big car .an impression that i had from this tv commercial is , `` get a big car , get your dignity .but the car eats gas like a monster .in these days , especiall after the midle-east crisis , the gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you perchase .more people concern about efficiency much more they used to before .i believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need .the ad does nt show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current .we , comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement .
