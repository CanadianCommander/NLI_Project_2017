i will agree the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .the people who try new things will get more chance to be successful in these new things .they also can build a good interest in their lives .finally , they can lead our society to a higher level .people try new things and take risks will have a higher chance to achieve their goals .they are the first people who take the opportunties to try and research these things .for sure they are so brave and never give , so , they will keep trying and trying until they finally work out they won goals .when these people finish they new things and risks , and success at them , they will enjoy the taste of them .this taste is what they are looking for while they are taking the risks , at last , they ca nt get out of this taste and keep trying other new things .for example , edison and newton never stop after he has invented light-ball .those people much be high educated , knowledgable and skillful .they need to use their skill and knowledgabel to solve the problems that exits during the research .on one hand , other people can use the new knowledge that they have found , and use this thing to up-date theirselves .on the other hand , those people have already high educated .they can open a course or a programe to our sociey and pass the knowlege to younger generations .basicly , that will blance the society and bright our society to a hight level .people try new things and take risks have more advantages than the people who only doing what they already know how to do well .for these people who keep doing the old things , out knowledge and society wo nt be improved .so i agree the statement .
