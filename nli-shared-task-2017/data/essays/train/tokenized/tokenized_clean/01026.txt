today , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the fact that there is almost not restrictions about some advertisement let big companies a lot of false and even impossible arguments to sell their product .also , they know how to touch people s thought with their different analysts .the most dramatic of all is the use of peoples symbol which misleads people  statements .the restrictions on televisions commercial are very small or do nt even exist .a company owner has simply to give the the money for the advertisement of the company .this advertisement will be accepted without any restrictions because the only restriction that we have is the nudity scenes , but we don ` t have to prove that what we said is true .we can take an advertisement which is about get slim .in this advertosement , you will see peoples saying that they have lost weight in 4 weeks .a man who will herd those talkings will be attracted to the products , but the people s talkings on the advertisement are false .the other probable element wil be the use of analysts .those analysts are very smart because they know what people want to hear .so , with only one speech written by them , they can make a product seem as fantastic when this product is not .as example , we take a man who wants a car .now , this man watchs an advertisement on which they say that the car make girl crazy , and even shows you a woman who is persecuting a man because of the car .the man will like to have this car in the minute following these advertisements .however , is that statemement in the advertisement true ?these statement is not .so , a lot of peoples will be fooled .the most dramatic thing about advertisement is the use of people s symbol or fan to sell product .some studies have shown that children under a certain age are more to do what their stars think is right .in this way , we can imagine a basketball player who is saying that a certain product is good .all the children who like this player will buy the products when they shall have an opportunity without any hesitation .unfortunately , the product is not so so good as it is supposed to be to finish , i would say that i agree with the fact that advertisement make product seem better than they really are .
