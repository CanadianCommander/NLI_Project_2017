both young and old people could enjoy life .it entirely depends on the individuals .this can be better described by explaining the terms ` joy  and ` happiness  .the chief reason for my view is that the way people enjoy their life entirely depends on the way they percieve happiness .some people tend to experience happiness even at their bad times .we see defense personnel of a country showing a lot of pride when they loose their lives in a war .this is unusual in the case of other individuals .the other reason for my view is that joys and sorrows are part and parcel of the life , and one has to encounter these two situations in a happy way .we see great sport persons on the television who , at worst of their times on the field tend to carry a smile on their face .some of them , winning matches even out of such situations .the reason being playing the sport in the true spirit by understanding the complexities of the game .others might argue that the way people enjoy their life is influenced by many factors such as their economic status , freedom and liberty .i.e in making their decisions , ambience , health status etc .but the point i emphasize in my views is that one can not have all the mentioned factors which are materialistic .every individual lack something .in sum , i concur that people who learn to get satisfied with what they have and who do nt obsess on what they lack tend to enjoy their life more .it is not the age factor ( .i.e young or old ) , but , it is the attitudes of the people which determine how much they enjoy their life .
