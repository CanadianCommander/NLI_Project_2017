i agree with the statement that states young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their own communities because i feel that the youth of the nation in today s scenario is more exposed to different things in life in terms of advancement in the technology and achievements in global comunications and world s infrastructure .the teenagers have greater accessibility to things in life than in early days .the question of helping the society or do something beneficial for others seems less important to them , for many reasons that keep them preoccupied and also for the fact that nowadays , most parents do not teach their children about society s development , hygeine and may also hardly find any peer groups who will be interested in any social activity .what keeps them involved in themselves and staying aloof in their own world is the improvement in technology and communication where most teenagers would want to experiment new things and the urge of trying various new gadgets and the resources for gaining more knowlegde where they can boost to their peers .the entertainment industry also plays a major role here where the youth would want to be updated with all da latest movies , t.v shows and music .the arrival of networking systems and the internet gives the youth more accessibility to things in any part of the world at any time .within clicks , the information is present in front of them and be it on any subject matter .the night life in pubs and clubbing is another method of socializing and keeping themselves partied with the high music blasts and tapping of the floor .the sports is anther craze for the youth to be busy involved into , be it formula1 race , football , tennis or cricket .therefore , with the entertainment packages and the encylopedia at their hand the youth nowadays hardly cares for their own society but themselves .it is so much possible that they dont even find the time for the ocassional get togethers within their own communities .leave alone communities , may be for their own family members .everyone is so involved in their own daily tasks and routine , that even though it becomes mundane at a point , the youth will definately keep themselves occupied with something new to explore and learn .but will not think of helping their own communities .the youth are not to be blamed here completely as it requires the awarenes and the sense of responsibility towards their own society which can be brought only by their own parents and elders and ofcourse the education that they are receiving .the shows on tv also to a certain extend do influence the youth .therefore , more shows and programs should be telecasted and more films should be made to bring about the awareness within the youth .as the society we come from protrays the kind of person we are and th eliving standards we have .
