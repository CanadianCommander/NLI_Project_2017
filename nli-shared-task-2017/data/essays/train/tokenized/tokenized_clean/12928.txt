i completelly disagree with this statement .but before supporting my opinion i should define what i understand for enjoying life .for me enjoying life means selfawareness , being aware of what we have and being able to feel pleased with it .according to my definition of enjoying life , the only requirement to do it is to have awareness .that means that not only young people can do this .adults could enjoy much more than young people .after all , they have accquired more experience during their lives and have gain more independency .people with more experience have , generally , a clearer idea of what they want and are in a more settled-down possition .while young people are just about to discover theirselves , and their sort of freedom cause a lot of anxiety .they are not sure what they want for their lives .they have to live day by day trying to find out wheter they want to study or not , where they want to live , etc .and this kind of situation brings them sometimes more stress than pleassure .young people have yet a lot to learn , about their lives and themselves .there is a well-know quotation that says that we do not value what we have until we have lost it .this usually happen to young people who , for instance , do not value their time living with they parents , thinking that life would be much easier or better by their own .and after they lost their parents , they regret not having enjoyed more time with them .once again , if you are not aware of something , if for some reason you can not value it , and this reason could be lack of knowledge or experience , how can you enjoy it at the most ?in conclussion , i believe everyone can enjoy life as much as anyother .it is an individual task and has nothing to do with the age , sex or culture .it is important for me to explain that with the examples i gave before i am not saying that adults actually do enjoy life more .
