nowadays most of the people could nt do without their car .there is no doubt that the grade of dependance upon the car varies considerably depending on the culture and the country we are focusing on .for example , in the american way of life a car is simply essential , while the citicens of amsterdam , for instance , make a greater use of bicicles than cars .however , we desperatly depend on something that must have and end and whose end is unlikely very close : oil .therefore , everybody would agree in the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .perhaps twenty years is nt a long time but i m sure that we are at a turning point .in my opinion there have already ben made incredible improvements that would have helped us to move towards ecological cars .however , i m certain that at this point it has nt been interesting economically speaking puting them in the market .more than once have we heard in the news that an engineer has finally discovered how to build a car that works with hidrogen or other organic materials .however , just as happens with the powerful industry of medicaments , sometimes an improvement is ironically not benefitial .i probably sound tremendously skeptical but i must say that i m hopeful that someday not in a long time somebody will make a car that does nt pollute and depends on a renovable good .that would definately cause an increase in that car s demand , what would mean a dicrease in the use of the traditional car .anyway , even if my best wishes do nt come true , i would still believe that in twenty years time a decrese in the use of the traditional car will occur in the developed countries .to ilustrate my point i will take china as an example .the population in china is huge and , while most of europe and north america has already experiences a crazy developing period that has lead them to industrialisation and our actual welfare , china and many other asiatic countries are now at that point .and , unlikely , we can not demand en ecological consciousness from them , when we ourselves have had non of it .and if all the chinese buy a car . ..
