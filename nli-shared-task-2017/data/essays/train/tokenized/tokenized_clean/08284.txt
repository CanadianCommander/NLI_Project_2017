in twenty years from now , the number of cars in use will be extremely high .there is no chance for having less number of cars .there are quite many reasons to support my statement .the main reason for expecting a huge number of cars in mere future is by considering the past records .the number of cars some years ago were very less .but today its number is almost doubled .every process future analysis is based on a `` hysterisis  curve , which shows the probability of any issue considering the past statistics .in the same manner we can have a histerisis curve for the usage of cars .it depicts a huge increase of number of cars in use in future .the other main reason is the increase in the population and their standards of living .the standards of living of people is increasing day by day .people are aiming high and acheiving high .every one is trying to reach the best position in life .a car reflects the status of a person in the society .so people are showing interest to own a car .its becoming one of their most important part of their luxury list .so it can be expected that every middle class individual owns a car in coming twenty years .this increases the number of cars used .the selling price of a car is becoming immensely low these days .its being reachable to every middle class individual .as the price is diminishing with time , every one is planning to own a car .even car industries are planning to reduce the price of the cars to increase their sales .this is to make them reachable to each and every person .for example , consider a television .television was a dream to every common man few years ago .its cost was around 3000 $ before .its demand was less at that time due to its heavy price .but today its cost came to less than half .today everyone owns a television .same is the case with mobile telephones too .in the same way we can say that a car becomes a part of life to almost every middle class individual .so , by considering many reasons and facts we can say that the number of cars that will be used in coming twenty years will be absolutely high .almost every individual owns a car in future .
