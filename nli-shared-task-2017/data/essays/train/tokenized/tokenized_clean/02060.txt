the thesis on hand is that succesful people try new things and do not only do things they already know .i think that this is true because it is a key to succes to make experiences and learn of your mistakes and problems and then improve yourself .first of all , it is very important to make experiences if you want to be succesful .when you try new things you will automatically make the experience if it was good or bad what you did .as a consequence you can improve your acting .for example , all ingeners are kind of people who try new things and do not always what they always know to do .this leads to very important inventions which would not have been made if people did not take risks .the best example is henry ford who invented a new kind a producing cars .this was risky but in the end it paid off and he was very succesful .second , if you want to be succesful you have to learn of your faults in order to improve yourself .when building a house for example , you will do some mistakes in putting all the stones together .afterwards the problem occurs that the house goes broke .now you can infer what you did wrong and the next time you will be more succesful .this shows that you can always be succesful by trying new things and learn of your mistakes .finally , if nobody ever tried new things humanity would still live in caves .i mean that every step forward is risky but it has to be taken otherwise there would be nor progress and no success at all .to conclude it can be said that succesful people try new things and are more likely to take risks because they will make valuable experiences and learn of their mistakes in order to improve themselves .this is a very important key to success .
