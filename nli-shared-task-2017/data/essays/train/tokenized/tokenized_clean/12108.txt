since most of our neighbours are pretty old people and since i did one year of social service in a home for the elderly , i think that i have worked with enough old people in my life to state that i totally disagree with the statement that says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think older people enjoy life in a different way than young people do .so if one compares activities young people prefer to do in their free time to activities that older people like to do during their spare time , one can easily see that old people most probably enjoy life just as much as young people .young people tend to go to bars or discos with their friends , for example .older people enjoy going to a restaurant with good friends or like to see an opera or a thatre play .i think that this is not that much of a difference in joy .it is only the type of activities they prefer that marks a difference .i would even dare to say that i think that older people have better chances and possibilities of enjoying life .since older people tend to be more experienced and therefore time-effective than younger people in many different areas such as cooking , housework , or even tasks at work , for example , they have more time to spare and for this reason more time to enjoy life ( if one suspects that working can not be any kind of joy ) .after retiring they also have a lot of time to do what they like or maybe even make dreams come true .take some of my neighbours , for example .after retiring they went on a trip around the world to see a lot of famous places and to experience different cultures for about eight months .younger people could not afford such an activity .they usually have nt saved enogh money and they usually have a job that wo nt allow an absence of eight months .to sum up , one can see that even when only having a rather `` time-based  look at the statement that was made , there is no chance of agreeing with it at all .it would even be unfair to say something like that because it implies that activities younger people do are more enjoyable than the ones of older people .but this is and always will be subject to personal bias and opinion .
