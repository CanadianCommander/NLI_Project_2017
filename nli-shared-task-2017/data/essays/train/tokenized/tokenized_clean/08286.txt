i disagree with the statement `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities  .you can find youngsters doing commuty services at college , at the welfare clubs and anywhere they find themselves needed .college is main area of such service centres .they have their own groups there that does works like collecting funds from students for a worthy cause , or conducting any event , may it be cultural or academic to raise the money for a need .i would like to quote something related to the recent `` tsunami  attack that killed lives of many .there were casualties and loss of properties and the poor people who live in coastal regions were badly affected .our college group , who wanted to help the victims , raised a `` contribute some and save them  event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty thousand .it would be small , when only one college is considered , but when all the colleges in that area are considered its a substantial sum .its even amazing how much such events in colleges throughout the country would have acquired .another instance to quote is the recent `` blood donation  camp that was organised by the youth club in my locality .the event was done with guidance and it was a huge success .people , mainly youngsters - both boys and girls participated whole heartedly .and it surely would save lives .not only at college or residential area , even at our workplace such services occur frequently - may be blood donation camp , may be raising money for a cause , or maybe visiting a hospital or an orphanage .these visits include spending time the children in orphanage and making them smile and doing cultural perfomances to give them a good time .or hospital visit - majorly to help in soothing the patients and hearing their problems .both visits end up in donations being made to them .these show that youngsters are doing community services very good .
