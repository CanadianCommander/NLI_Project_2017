importance of understanding ideas and concepts to learning the factsyes , i do agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more to be stressed upon than learning the facts .the `` ideas  are ones individual s .and `` concepts  are formed on the basis of the depth of research on a topic or a statement .concepts are the basic and easiest way to approach any diversity of topics .it helps to comprehend the subtle nuances conveyed in the text .once formed they can not be shifted into a new frame unless otherwise proved through years of regular study .as an example newton gave three theories of motion after proved and approved by other scientists also .einstein thought why an apple falls on the earth downwards from the top of a tree .he did not accept this as a fact but worked on it and improvised a mathematical approach to it .it was an idea that was hitting his mind and at last he came over with a genuine proof for it .ideas give birth to new inventions  .it is best said by some body .it is just important that how seriously we study on the topic and how far we prove them to be correct in a more logical way .learning facts is least important .it is simply getting the things into your heads without giving a thought to it .it is called `` cramming  .yes , one must be aware of the facts but reasoning is equally important .one must not learn but abserve them , analyse them and reason them so hat the same previously learnt concep can be applied without any panick .ideas and concepts are the basis to learning the newer and inventing the newer technologies .facts can be created as many times as we desire from its basic root .the beautiful boulevard of life is full of new experiences that further forms the learning or a concept .just enjoy the new experiences giving a logical thought to it .
