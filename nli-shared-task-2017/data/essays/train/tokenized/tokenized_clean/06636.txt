i disagree with this statement .first of all i think that the lack of help within the communities is a problem in general .it does not only concern young people , but everybodey .i think it is more a problem of peoples  state of mind than of young people beeing selfish .the overall attitude of people towards helping each other and puting themself up for something good has gone worse .most people are completely focused on themselves .they only care about their work , interests or their own problems .but in my opinion there have been many attemps to improve this situation .many companys for example expect from the candidates who apply for a job that there has been some kind of engagement , which is not supposed to relate to their education directly .that is why many students join organisations in their community , which purposes are to take care of other students or engage for social matters .this way they learn to take over responsibility and keep this state of mind up in their future life , teaching this to their kids later on .there are also some companys who support their communities themselves by making donations or supporting students , hospitals , kindergardens etc. in their communities in some other way .the value of the community and taking over responsibility has increased i think .the issue has become more present in the meantime .hectic and pressure are controlling many peoples  lifes .for young people it is especially their fear of the future .but eversince this way of living has occured , people more and more feel the need of comfort and support .the urge of having someone helping and supporting them , will hopefully result in a chance of mind .that is why i am thinking that there will be improvements concerning this issue .not only in young peoples  but everybody s mind .
