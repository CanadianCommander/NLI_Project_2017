nowadays , some people think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .technology is growing everyday and also transformation is improving too .this makes people use busses , trains , ships and planes .on the other cars are getting cheaper everyday with technologies improvement so everybody can buy a car today .today if we look to car prires , we can see that there are cars for everybody s budget .in my country nearly everybody know how to drive a car and they say that they ca nt live without their cars .they drive to shool , to work and also they are driving for hobby .when you come to turkey , you can see the families which have three members , have three cars .we can understand that cars have big part in our lifes .i think in twenty years everybody will have car and the traffic problems will be more than today too .car firms are improving their selves and they are producing more cars than last years .we can see that the firms such as audi and bmw are re-newing their models with new skills every year aproducing new cars although they .according to a article in the autoshow magazine the smallest firms are producing at least 350 million cars in a year and it shows us that trafic will be more crowded in the future .as a result there will be more cars in use than there are today .in my opinion goverments should build more roads .
