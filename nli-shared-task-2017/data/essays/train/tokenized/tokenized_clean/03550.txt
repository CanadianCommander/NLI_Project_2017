i agree to the fact that there will be fewer cars in a twenty years time from now .i support to this point because there has been an increasing amount of awareness about the rise in the number of cars in the city .the streets and roads have become more crowded and there is more difficulty for the pedestrians to walk on .there has been surprizing increase in the number of road accidents lately .not only this , more cars mean more pollution and more pollution means more global warming , which is a hottest issue in every country .becasue of the problem of global warming , people are favouring to the concept of travel through buses and trains .people going to offices have resorted to going more than one in the same car rather than each one going in his/her own car .this greatly reduces the pollution and expenses of a person , furthur leading to the decrease in the number of cars on road .the railway network connecting cities and metro railway network with a city is supporting to the travel of many people throughout the day .being cheaper than the cost incurred upon using own vehicles , people are resorting to such options .i oppose the argument of the increase in number of cars because of many of the reasons stated above .moreover , the increase in cars on the raod leads to havoc and doesnt give a good impression of the cleanliness of the city .recently , in new delhi , there has been an increase in temperature in the summers than the earlier years owing to more pollution in the city .after the starting of metro railway , many people use this reliable , safe and easy service making a commendable impression on other cities .this has caused an acceleration in the making such decisions to lessen number of cars on the road in other cities .concluding , i feel optimistic in the decrease of number of cars in use in a twenty years time owing to its much awaited advantages and long lasting effects both for a safe city and for a better nature .
