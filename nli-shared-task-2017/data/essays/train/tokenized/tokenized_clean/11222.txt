i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because media have a strong effect on people , and how much the product became a familiar to people it became better .as we all know that advertisements is an essential step to make any product to be success .it is also can be a misleading for people know nothing about products in market .the advertisements is using a simple way to get simple people are not aware if that product are good enough for them or no , and as a result of worldwide media now and the expantion of it become more easy to get people in traps of these advertiesments .as any company make good products or bad products all are seeking for binifits of these products .but the difference that good comapines are affraid on thier respective , rather than other company produce less qaulity items for market .if we take a soap product under consideration , and if we asume that there are two companies are producing such a material we call them x and y respectivly with good product and bad product .in the following situation we will see how that media will make the bad product of y better than broduct of x. company y choose a international program that many of people like to watch it and they like to keep watching it continously .they advirtise their product over and over for long time .which make people uncontionsly take on this product and being familiar with it .so when people go to a market and want to buy a soap as our example .the customers will find two products one is for x and the other for y , and because the strong advirtisement of product y the customer will choose the product y. even so product x is better than product y the customer choose product y .so in my opinion how much the advertisements of a products were good and alot .how much better the product will be better than reall is .and here become the role of customer in seeking what really better not what he saw in tv .
