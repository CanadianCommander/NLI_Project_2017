being successful in life is something that we all desire , unluckily only a few ones will manage to get it .personally , i think that success depends on many things and not only on taking risks because if you want to be the number one on something , you need to be born with certain skills , give the best of you and to make an important sacrifice .some people may agree in saying that being succesful means to break the rules , however you can not break any rule if you do not know how rules work first .i mean , if you want to be the best at playing soccer , you need to know that there are certain rules that you are suppose to follow , like team work , solidarity , understanding your mates etc .in this case , to think that you will become the best football player in the world by doing whatever you want and not paying any attention at all to any recomendation is absolutely nonsense .obviously , when you behave like this , you are taking a risk , but that risk is ridiculous and naive .i wholeheartedly believe that if you ever dream of being a successfull man , sometimes you will have to take a risky step , but that step can not be taken without having the previous knowledge about something or withouth being fully aware of the consequences .the fact that we live in a society that everyday demands more and more , makes us think that if we do not gain sucess we are nothing .nevertheless , success is not a matter of being the best at something , but being the best in all these small things that we do in our everyday life .to conclude , if you want to be successful take risk , but do not let this risk destroy your whole life .
