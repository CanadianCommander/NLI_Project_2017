i agree with the statement , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .broad knoledge on many accademic subjects play an imortant role in the future as ample exposure to all the profficional subject , get an analytical sills , know all the things about the society .in my view broad nowledge get only taking many accademic subjects offered by the university .knowledge is gain only by learning more things in the world .todays world is globaliged one thats why we learn more things .we grip on many subject we get ample exopsure greatly and easily .secondly , analyticall sills are use full for every person in the society they get by learning different subjects .they give broad variety of knowledge to communicate easily with the others .all accademic subbjects are related to the our proffictional programming .those are use full in the future .those subjects give thining ability to your mind .besides specialization subjects they give stenth to your mind .some times i thin that many of the academic subjects for upto undergraduate level are more usefull to get wide varitey of knowledge , after complition of undergradute , concentrate on the specialized subject that is related to our proffectional academics that time its gives an more information about specialize subgect and accuire good knowledge easily and quickly .more evere concentration also play an important role in specialized subjet .in sum of all the above important points , many academic subjects give broad nowledge than the single specialized subject .many accademics provide skills , good knowledge thinking , strenthen his education period .so it is better to take many subjects .
