famous french army general and president charles de gaule once said :  the best ways of studying how to command is to study a broad of knowledge of many academic subjects  .why did he say that ?and is this only good to learn how to command , or is this true for everything ?that is the question to answer .i would say it depends on what one s expect it s knowlege is needed for .on one hand , if it is for everyday living , i suppose this is very right : for exemple , during the day , we all meet many people who with we talk about very different subject ( economics , social issues , work , family or simply last night tv program ) .in this case , the more on different subject we know , the more people will appreciate to talk with us .if someone wants to know your own point of view on an specific event , and if you answer him  i do nt know and i  not interested in that  , we can guess he will not ask you anymore . ..ther is anothere exemple : most politics program are based on economic or social problems to solve .if you do nt have any idear about it , how will you understand the debate , the different opinions ?and how then , will you make your choice for the next vote ?moreover , i beleive , we all still have a child slleeping in our brean : so like children , we like discovering new things , being curious , this is another good reason to study many acade ; ic subjects .on the other hand , i beleive it is difficult for a teacher or a scientist not to specialize in one subject .same thing for peolple who have very specialized jobs such as engineers or finance administrators . ..how would these people be experts if they had not specialize in their owm specific subject .how would a teacher answer to all the questions student ask him every lessons ?as it seens impossible to specialize in all the subjects , i suppose these teachers , scientists or expert have no choice .however , i beleive , they still also studied other subject , even if it is not with the same accuracy .also , i think they are interested in many other subjects and they can talk about other things than their owm specific subject .i think there is no better way of studying , it depends on what you will have to do later in your jobs .but me , i definitely followed charles de gaulle advice . ..
