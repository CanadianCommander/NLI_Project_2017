the author suggests the young people enjoy life more than older poeple .i neither agree nor disagree with the statement .i believe it purely depends on the mind-set and the personality of the individual himself than it does on his age when it comes to enjoying life .a pessimist in his prime would surely not enjoy life as much as an optimist who is in his old age .generally considering , a young person is not burdened with responsibilities and thus has a carefree life compared to the one led by older ones .thus , he would enjoy his life more than does a older one .also , enjoyment is an abstract word .one may find enjoyment in partying , hanging out with friends doing all sorts of carefree stuff while others may find enjoyment in their work .thus , it is hard to say a person is fully happy when he is in a community gathering enjoying himself .also .it would be incorrect to say that a person is not enjoying when he is seriously involved in work .it just depends on what one thinks is enjoyment .as it is , young age is the most enjoyable part of one s life as a man is healthy without any ailments or diseases .thus , even in medical terms , he is well equipped in young age and thus , can enjoy life more .when one grows older , one may find fulfiling his responsibilities to be a happiness .thus , he will be happy and may be more happy than a young person as he has no more responsibilities to fulfil .some people enjoy challenges .thus , when such a person encounters challenges and finds all possible ways to win the situation and starts applying these to his problem , he may find his life more joyful and more enjoyable .i will conclude this essay by reiterating my stand that , enjoyment of life depends on the perspective of the individual than it does on his age .
