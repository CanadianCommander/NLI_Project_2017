we all love advertisements .one the one hand women like the nice jeans advertisement guys , on the other hand men like underwear models in the same way or even more .but , are we really influenced by advertisements ?do they really make us feel that some products are better .in fact , do we really taste mcdonald s in another way if we have seen an advertisement before .do we really feel better if we drive a bmw x5 , which is delivered fresh from the enterprise in munich !i m of the opinion : it depends !refering to the two examples from the introduction , i want to explain why i think , that it depends if advertisements make products seem better :firstly , i want do deal with the mcdonalds example .i claim , that we do not taste a big mac in another way if we see an advertisement .the reason is that you feel or taste food and things like shoes or other things that relate to your body .consequently , i think you can not betray your body .indeed , i believe you can do it for a short period of time , but if you bought the wrong size of a pair of shoes you will have to confess to yourself after a certain time that it was a wrong buy .i think eveybody of us has bought at least one time shoes or a pair of jeans which did not fit , but we wanted to say to ourselves they are just perfect !on the contrary , i claim that if you buy a car , advertisements make it seem better .just think about the nice winter landscape , the car drives with his four wheel system through the snow like it would be a normal street .you would love to say that this is your car .in fact , i learned at the univerity , that especially car manufacturers are often placing ads in newspapers and television , just to make their buyers secure they did the right thing .hence , car manufacturers do exactly what is stated in the question of this essay : they try to make a product seem better through an advertisment .also of my own experience , i can say i have experienced that a product gets better through an advertisement .everywhere on the university are ads of ibm , and i glad i have an ibm laptop , because otherwise , i would ever feel like i have a bad pc , because nowhere is an ad of it .to conclude , i want to summarize my opinion .an ad just can make a product better if it does nt harm yourself in a way .all personally related products can only be made better for a short time period , whereas other , just technical things , like cars , video games or even a microwave can be made better through an advertisement .
