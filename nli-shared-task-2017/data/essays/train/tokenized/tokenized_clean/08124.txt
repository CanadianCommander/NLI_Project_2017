as far as i consider , in now a days young people have no enough time to help others or to their communities .how ever there is no time to eat food also .in that condition how they help others .in the developing country like india young people have so many responsibilities .so they are bussy with their responsibilities .avery person has his self duty .for instance , a college students are bussy with there daily appointments , that means daily work with their books .in adittion to that a b.e student has no time to take his tiffen also .he is bussy with his collage work , he is having alot of work i.e.lab work , record work like that so many affairs are there to him .and next coming to the point of young people , those are going to their duties , having full of work tension in there officies , so they can not also help others .a very person in this world is full of work .in order that bussy they have no time to help their communities .some people have intension to help others , those are called samaja seva , with this they can help others , but they are affraid of others .others means they are roudies .the people who wanted to help others has to face some problems .that why young people can not show attention to help others .more over , helping others is a good habit .if we `` helping one person that leads to help other two persons  .this was said by south indin mega star in his film .that film story is full of same concept .i think at this movement south indian people are started to do helping others .in the world like india , peoples are sentimental .they can help us to each other .but they are fully engaged with their work and responsibilities that s why the young people is not showing interest on helping others .finally i conclude that , in present days young people really have no enough time to helping communities .
