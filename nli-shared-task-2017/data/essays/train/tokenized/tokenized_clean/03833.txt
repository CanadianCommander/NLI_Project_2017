the immense growth of advertising in the last decade or so , is indisputable .the phenomenon of ` implicit learning  , as coined by psychologists is not only exploited here , but also used jointly with techniques that influence human decision-making , making the advertised products seem more attractive than they already are .there are several ways in which advertising could influence decision-making by presenting products in a more desirable way .while watching tv or travelling on a train , the advertisement itself is the first thing that attracts one s attention even before the product is on display .we find certain scenarios more interesting and laughable or enjoyable and catchy than others .the use of memorable and easy slogans , although how annoying they may be sometimes , are retained in memory like no other information .the repetitions of those slogans , along with greater and repeated exposure times , is a key factor in the retention of a certain product in memory .no matter how bad the product or the slogan might be within aesthetic guidelines , people remember !on the other hand , the advertising community will know their audience better than anyone else , especially if the commercial becomes successful in selling the desired amount of their product .there are certain types of ` appeal tactics  that they use such as presenting a certain character trait belonging to the audience , followed by how the current product will help enhance or complete that character trait .by playing on insecurities or the ` coolness factor  , advertisements could push their way into the decision-making process .a product could be presented as someone s long-waited-for solution to all problems , whereas it s someone else s ego-booster .the advertising world has also technologically advanced itself in order to get better access into one s mind .the use of multiple media sources such as tv s , radios and newspapers give more than one dimension to advertisements themselves , hence making their products more desirable .the tv in particular is a great stage for that purpose .commercials can now use greater graphic design and animations to be more interesting and attention-grabbing .products look more colorful and the effects are more intense .for instance , a washing powder could be demonstrated in so many different ways such that even the molecular construction of it is conveyed .the video presentations that follow are interesting and convincing , making the products look much better than they are .consequently advertising enhances product desirability in multiple ways and usurps many techniques that visual technology , in particular , offers .this leads to better advertising skills and more convincing results in order to make products more attractive .
