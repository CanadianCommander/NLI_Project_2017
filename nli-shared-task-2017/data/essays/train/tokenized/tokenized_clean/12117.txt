trends of consumption societywe live in a material world .this world has been like that after the invention of equipments which help traders to reach their consumers much easier .advertising became the most important equipment as it is recognized to be aiding in sales ; making no difference if it is a good product or not .therefore advertisements are making us to think the product is just perfect .advertising is the best selling technique for a product in the market .for the producers to earn more , consumers should be convinced that there is no problem with the product .even if a product is good enough for the specific purpose , when it is introduced as having few bad points besides lots of good points producers will loose money .this is not desirable , so the producers find an easy way out : misleading their consumers through advertisements !it is harder to convince a consumer than to make him have a negative attitude towards the product .the reason for the preparation of misleading advertisements is not one-sided .it is a relation of effect and fact .the consumers are mostly willing to see better and better products .they regularly want to see new and perfect material .they can not stand seeing bad points of the things they consume .this is the famous trend of consumption communities .everything that the members of the society face with should be good looking .most of the time they do not even bother about the idea of being cheated .they ask for it so that they accept it with the eyes shut .advertisements making the products seem much better than they really are , are just the consequence of developping consumption idea .as long as there is a demand for it , producers will not hesitate to cheat on their consumers .this is the basic deal .
