i agree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .i say this because of the following reasons .1. young ones will be having a lot of time to have fun when compared to the older ones .the older people will be busy in work and they will not be having that much free time which the young ones get .even though it sounds rude it is a fact .2. the young ones obviously will have less responsibilities and works to do .but the older ones will be having more responsibilities and works to do .they have to maintain their houses .do their works without rests inorder to survive with the family .here the young ones dont feel this responsibility .they are free they can enjoy in their own ways .it is obvious that as age increases responsibilities increases and also the burden of work .3. statistics say that young ones are very energetic and enthusiastic and its obvious that there is adrenaline rush more when compared to the older ones .but the older ones are not that energetic and not that enthusiastic just to mention not in all cases .there are also healthier old ones who are enthuisiastiv and energetic but i mention on an average basis .4. a older guy will be restricted mostly to office doors , research labs , industries and other organisation s .they spend a lot of time over there .but coming to the young ones they enjoy leaning in school because the education is combined to entertainment to make edutainment .in college also the learning would be interesting makes the student to say `` wow  where as the older ones say `` oh no  with the burden of work .again i mention many of the old ones enjoy their jobs and work they get involved .5. kids enjoy their times in school they play , learn with nothing to feel responsible and they are the free birds they can do what they wish in proper sense .teens enjoy their times in college by learning , playing sports , having chat with friends , they make love with people around them .they have parties , club activities and many more to enjoy .they have a lot of free time to develop their skills , involve in their subject of interest .they are free birds .in the case of older guys they can do this only on one condition `` if there is time  .conclusion :**************i do believe that anyone can enjoy their life at any age if and only if they have the heart to do so .i have written in favor of young ones because i felt that it is happenning most in my society .one should have the heart to enjoy every moment .one should feel that life is beautiful .every moment is precious .life is precious gift .
