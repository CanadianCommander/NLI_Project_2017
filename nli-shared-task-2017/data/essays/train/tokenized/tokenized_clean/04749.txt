especiallz the elderlz often complain about the younger genreation .in their opinion the zouth does no longer spend much time of beneficial things to their communitz .i think that s true .in the following i want to point our = t several reasons why .first , there is a more severe competition among young people on jobs than in the past .nowadays the youth has to work harder to obtain their goals in their professional life .as a result activities that do not reward in the short run , like helping in the community , are no longer on the schedule of the youth .despite the honour of politicians and new laws to strenghten the juristical position of voluntary work , many abstain from it .second , in my opinion people are now more individual than earlier .young persons occupy themselves with tv or video games .spending their time alone with no , or little interest in other peoples affairs seems to be more atrractive .this egoistical behaivior can be found in a current published  shell studie  .as the study points out lesser and lesser young peole are enganged in public interest activities like foodball clubs or scout organisations .finally , acoording to the study we can assume that more persons are not willing to work hard for other individuals .as a result , oing something to your commmunity is always connected with some labour .most citizens think to lead a foodball club for kids , for example , can be no fun at all !it is generally thought that having a beer in a pub or at home is more valuable spend freetime .but is it really ?i think not , working with children is quite satisfying .monitoring their progress and celebrate victories with the team is real fun , as i know from my own experience .to sum up , a fully agree with the statement .besides political ambitions are visible , only view individuals are engaged in helping their communities .
