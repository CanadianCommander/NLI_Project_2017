i disagree with this statemant which says that understanding ideas and concepts than learning facts .when you listen to somebody s lecture or opinion , you might have questions about it .then , you might start researching what the fact is .imagine that you are in class , being taught about history .your teacher tells you one event with reading a text book .you become interested in that historical event .it is prooved the event is true , i think , however , it is not the only anwser , because no one saw it acutually .you can start research to find the fact .you might get much defferent information about it .that is the fact about that historical event .however , as you learned the fact , you can have your own opinions about it .i believe that having your own opinions is the most important thing .understanding the ideas and concepts is impotant , because it gives you a chance to have questions .learning facts means that includes understanding ideas and concepts is more important .moreover , you can see the fact and have your opinions about matters .
