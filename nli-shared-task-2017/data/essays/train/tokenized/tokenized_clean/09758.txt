the life is a relatively short period for some people .however , if you succeed in achieving the benefits at any age , it will no longer be a problem .enjoying the life at older ages will bring you the feeling of a long life .it also comes with the question of the difference between young people and the older ones about the enjoyment gathered from the life .as far as i m concerned , older people enjoy life the way it has to be and it brings them many advantages against younger ones .at earlier ages , people are not even aware of the time passing rapidly and have the lack of experince which will let them enjoy the life the way it is meant to be .on the other side , being older gives you the comfort of knowing what to do and where to do .especially after retirement , you have nothing to worry about whereas younger people feels the pressure of the responsibilities against their families and also the dilemmas they usually come up with .moreover , older people do know how to spend their money to get the most of it .in addition to what i ve said before , of course there are many disadvantages of being older which maybe seems to badly affect your life .nonetheless , if you have the right point of view , you can easily see that those are not even taken into consideration .for instance , being less energetic is an important lack against the younger people .however , if you use it efficiently and effectively , it wo nt be a problem to cope with anymore .with that in mind , if you care for yourself enough , you can also stand against health problems longer than you think .in conclusion , i completely disagree with the statement provided .older people really know how to enjoy the life .
