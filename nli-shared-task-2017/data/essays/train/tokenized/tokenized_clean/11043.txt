young people have future .i agree this statement .now i am a person who is thought young people .i enjoy my life now .may be i will have some problems in the future .these troubles will cause difficluty that i can enjoy the life .now a days many older people have these problems .on the other hand , young peole have a long future .most of them will live longer than older people , so they can plan many things what they are going to do in the future .this is also means that if they have a trouble , they have enough time to solve it .for example health problem and finance problem .at first , ususally young people are healther than older people .helth problem is seriou and it aboid happy life .in my experonence , my grandmather always suffer from her disease .because of this disease , it is hard for her to walk aroud her house .she can not go to shop to buy food .unfortunetly , recently sometimes she can not go to toillet on her own abilliy .she always says that she wishs , she can go back her young days .many japanese old people say that how your health is when they met some old person .the second , older people can not work , so they have to consider about their finance .they have to manage the money .it is stress for them .however young people can work well , because they are fine .they do not have to care about it .also it is easy for them tothem to rend money .in conclusion , i do not have a serious problem that she older people have now , but i will have soon .what should do is not only enjoying this life but also prepare for the future .therefore , i suppose this statement is true .
