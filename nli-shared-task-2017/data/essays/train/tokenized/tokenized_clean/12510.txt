there are many people prefer travelling alone , while some prefer travelling with group .this preference depends on people s character and the way of their life .if i go somewhere i would like to be with my friends .i think traveling with group is the best way .one reason i beleive that is , it is very difficult to make new friends for me .i am very shy and not talkative person .traveling would be enjoyable with somebody who l can have a lot of thing to talk and share .otherwise it would be so boring .i have not traveled by myself until i came to the us .after that trip , i decided that i will never travel alone anymore .i thought that this flight would not finish .another reason i think group trip is the best way is , it makes be more confident .trying to new thing in new places makes me anxious ; however , if l have a friends next to me , i can do whatever i want .it gives me brave to do things which is in my mind .this life can be enjoyable with some crazy things and that is what we always do with group of friends .finally , friend can make any places enjoyable .even if there is nothing to do , talking with friends makes us happy .i can not have fun if l go to the italy to see rome or go to switzerland to ski .these thing can be enjoyable just with my friends .there should be worse situation .for example , if l go to the place that l have not known before and i do not like it , it woulde be so boring .however the group of friends can reduce that easily .
