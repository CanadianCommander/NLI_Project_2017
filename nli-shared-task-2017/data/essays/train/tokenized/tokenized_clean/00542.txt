i think older people should enjoy life more than young people .old peopl usually retered their jobs , so they have a lot of time .moreover , when they was young they were working hardly for many reasons .therefore , i think older people can enjoy more than young people .people usually said young people can to everything but older people are diffcult .however , i do not think so becouse my grandmother is always enjoy her life , for example , she learnes song , it called shigin in japan , and tradidional japanese dance .she stareted to learn thesethings when she was a 65 years old , but she can learn new things and enjoy these things .moreover , other my grandmother learn to sing a japanese song , for example enka songs , and plant vegitable and flower in her garden .she like to take care plants and eat freash vegitables .i think old people want to do new things becouse when they were young people they usuaslly could not to do anything to theirself .garbament could not allow free when during or after war .after war people always to work very hardly .they did not have a enough money and did not free time .however , now to change the enviroment , so they can to do anythings if they wont and have a money .when older people was young , they could not to have free time and could not to enjoy their lifes for working , but now they can have free time and to enjoy their lifes .therefore , i think older people shoul enjoy life more than young people do .
