i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i think that this statement is true because often when i watch an advertisement i think that the product seems good but when i saw the same product for real , i think the opposite .however , i is the aim of advertisements to make products look good as a result people want to buy the product .first i think that advertisments never represent the truth and i am often disappointed when i see a products by myself .for instance the last advertisement that i saw was one for food , some kind of bread which seems to be so good and tasty .as a result when i went to the shop i had a look at that bread but when i found it i was very angry because it was nt the same that on the advertisement .i know that advertisment are often opposite to the reality but somtimes i like to think that it would be what i was espected to be .thus sometimes i try to see if advertisements join the reality .then i know that the aim of advertisement is to make people dream so i can understand why there are often far from the reality .moreover people like to dream behind advertisements and like to think that life could be better and could tend to be the one they see in advertisements .nowadays , there are a lot of softwares to change pictures and make them look what people wanted to .as a result we are used to transform the reality and to brighten it and we are used to see the things as there are not .the fiction has barely take the place of the reality .therfor it is hard to know whether people have adapt themselves to advertisement or advertisements have adapt to t  people s expectation .in conclusion i agree with that statement but i do nt think that i can blame advertisers for that .
