in our society , we can see that many successful people who are succeed with the coming of new things .there is one statement saying that successful people try new things and they take risks rather than just doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with this statement .my reasons are as follows .firstly , if one people wants to be successful , he must create new ideas and create new things in his research field .creating new things means having risk at the same time .no one can predit what will happen next .we can see that the abundant knowleadge we learned in university are ordinary and need to be combined to create something new .if one only do what he has known to do well , nothings new will come out .as one example , we all know how to use internet to communicate , now we can chatting through pc camera and some chatting software , but before , we only could use internet to communicate through forum which was boring .the people who invented the software and the hardware did know how to create new things rather than did what he had know how to do .the software might be at risk of letting out personal information at first but it was resolve finally .then , the software benefits many people using internet to chat .secondly , ordinary things have no attraction to the public .people like to accept new ideas and something strange to people s everyday life .successful people tend to make new things to enrich people s life and at the same time , they like to take the risk .if they just do what they have known to do well like most of the ordinary people , they can not succeed .in history , there were many scientists who had denoted their lives to some scientific experiences .their goals were to invent something new to our society and made them benefit for people .what is more , the confidence of taking risk for something demonstrates one s ability which is better than ordinary people .not many people want to take risk for something .so , that is why some scientists succeed .we should increace the confidence to take risks for new things in order to create new things for our society .so in all , in my opinion , successful people will succeed when they try something new but not to do what they had known to do well .if one wants to succeed , the ability and braviation of trying new things and taking risk is necessary .
