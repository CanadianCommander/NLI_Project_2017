although some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i strongly prefer to travel individually .in my opinion , travelling in a group offers several drawbacks .first of all , travelling in a group prevents you to discover things by yourself because you always stay with the group .in addition , you always rely on the guide .in contrast , travelling individually allows you to discover places alone .for example , when i was in egypt , i noticed that the local population was nicer when you were travelling alone than when you were part of a group .second , group travels have the same schedule .they usually eat at the same time .in addition , they always have the same food .besides , group members should stay together .that means that you can not really be independant .whereas , travelling individually can let you more opportunitues to discover the local food , local monuments which are not described by a guide .furthermore , you can choose to visit the monuments when there are less people .therefore , i think that you are in a better position to appreciate the sight seeing .third , i think that group travels are too noisy and are sometimes very disrespecful towards a culture .as a matter of fact , i notice that the group tends too be very annoying .on the contrary , the individual tourist will try to fit into the environment .he generally shows more respect toward the local population and shows more curiosity .besides , travelling individually can offer the possibility to be in contact with the people of the country .in contrast , when you are in a group , you are less curious to go talking with the local population .finally , i would say that travelling in a group led by a tour guide can be the worse way to discover a different country and another culture .
