most advertisments really let products seem much better , than they really are .advertisment is one way to win new custumers .in order to fullfill this task you have to convince the custumor with arguments , but are there any good arguments for a chocolate bar ?most times buying vegetables would be the better choice .so advertisment uses the art of persuasion to win a custumor s heart .therefore you can not only present the good sites of a product , for example how great a chocolate bar delivers your daily needs of calories , or leave some fact out like the risk of cancer related to smoking a cigarette .often you have to add something to a product , which does not really exists .you may add a health factor to sugar coated cornflakes , because there some vitamins in them or give a product a social touch by supporting projects in the third world like evian water tried by their last campaign .but the most effective way to let a pruduct seem better is to make it absolutly necassary for the customer s happieness .if the customers does not purchase it he never gets happy .the product has to complete his life .for this you have to wake new needs with advertisment .the need to be cool is one of it , it is just the simple need to divers from others and only the new product helps to reach this aim .the best example for this is a new cell-phone .it provides a lot of new functions , but if everybody else owns one too , it fastly becomes boring .the ability to differ from the mass is only possible with a new one .this is the time when advertisment triggers .it presents not only the usual features of our new mobile phone it also shows how `` cool  the new product can be .another typical example for this way of creating new whishes is perfume advertisment .they try to tell , that the human wish of beeing accepted or having sex is only reachable with buying this kind of perfume .if really helps to attract a new partner is quite unsecure. a lot of other factors are also involved in the advertisment the perfume gets more abilities than it really has .so the product seem better than it really is
