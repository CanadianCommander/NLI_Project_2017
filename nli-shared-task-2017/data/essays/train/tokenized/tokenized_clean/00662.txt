these days , less and less young people are willing to give time to help their communities .this is because students simply do not have enough time to spend other than studying .moreover , students tend to care less about others nowdays .first , students spend so much time on their study that they do not have any spare time to help the others .many parents think that it is better for their kids to focus on their school work in order to enter a good unversity .according to a survey , more than a seventy percent of highschool students had not enough time to do other things beside studying .this proves the fact that even though some students want to participate in their volunteer work for their community , they will not be able to because of their limited time .therefore , young people do not spend their time volunteering because they do not have enough time .another reason is that the number of young people who care about other people are declining .their interest is only focused on their own success not on their communities .many experts say that a lot of mass media such as televisions and newspapers are responsible for this .they show the importance of winning the race only .they convince people that helping others is a waste of time .thus , more and more students are usually interested in gaining money or getting a good carrier .students are not interested helping others because they think it gives nothing in return .the young , therefore , are not willing to help their neighbors .this is because they scarcely have time to volunteer .moreover , even though they have time to help others , some students do not feel the nessesity of volunteer work because they do not think of others that much , these days .however , the decreasing number of volunteers is very tragedic to the society .we should make the young to care about others more to make this world better .
