many people are afraid when they try something new .on the other hand , some people enjoy the afraid feeling and the risks .many times , the some people , who try something not familiar , could be successful , fortunately .in my opinion , trying new things is effective and essential to make one s life and others  lives successful .the first reason why i think trying something new is right is that it needs to be brave .even though there are a lot of damages and risks as you try a new thing , the difficulties probably can give chances to your life .bravery is one of the most important factors in order to not only be success but also live confidence .in that , trying something new means the person is very brave , which need to be self-esteem oneself .i believe someone , who loves oneself , can enjoy his or her life .in addition , trying something new gives more oppurtunities .if you do what you already know how to do well , you would probably do not fail .however , you can not success as much as you want , because the ordinary thing is for everyone .the new things are only way to get more oppurtunities .for example , bill gates is the richest person in the world .however , at first , his company was not that much wealthy to make him the wealthiest person in the earth , because `` computer business  was not famous , then .fortunately , gates chanllenges into the new field , and he attains his goals and helps other humans to enjoy computers .finally , trying new things makes the world improved .when people who try new things success , it means the world becomes more comfortable .such as many inventors , scientists , or artists are the person who do express their idea in a new thing .because of their bravery , many human beings  lives become more convenience and interesting .successful people who try new things should be honoured by other people .i also want to be a successful people in order to improve not only me and but also other people .even though the first time to try new things is hard , i will not be afraid of doing that .for thes reasons , i think trying new things is effective and essential to make one s life and others  lives happier .
