for me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in only one subject .because the more knowledge we gain the more opputunitues for having jobs we would have .having broad knowledge is the key element which we can gain jobs .for example , i want to study accounting at university , and later i will have got the cpa .however , i will choose to study how to direct film as my subsidiary major because if one day i am tired with my carreer as an accountant , i can stil choose another job as a director .secondly .i think when we gain more knowledge we can learn a lot of beneficial things of those knoledge .for instance , when we learn about the history , we can learn about the major facts or issues that happened in the past , we can try to circumvent those malicious facts such as the ww2 and other disasters , and we can make some improvments from those historiucal facts .thirdly , learning more things can give us another aspect of viewing the world .from learning we can not only gain the knowledge from the academic subjects but also expand our minds .for example , when i was a child i viewed everything in the world with a narrow mind , but since i went to the high school i leain conclusion , i agree on that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic sujects because it can give us more advantages than it gives us drawbacks .
