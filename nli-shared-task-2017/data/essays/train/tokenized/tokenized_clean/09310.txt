i agree to some extent that old people may enjoy their life better than young ones .mainly probably they have achieved important portion of success and dreams they have been eager to procure .or simply because they are financially independent .they earn money and they support other members of their family .they may be also the source of advice and wisdom due to their experience in life .all these things may be true but i am sure as far as i know and have experienced that young people enjoy life fully .they benefit from every aspect of pleasure that it hasfirst yong people enjoy great deal of freedom which was not available to them in the past .the freedom of wearing the fashionable clothes that they liked .the freedom of being late at night as well as having aboy friend or a girl friend .in arab countries for instance the previous generation did not enjoyed that .and now merely in few cuntries in the middle east or north africa where people can enjoy having partners .second , young people enjoy their life through the new facilities available like cinea , theatre , night clubs , traveling abroad and studying in foreign countries .now we spend our holiday in very exotic areas in the world just we precise our destination and everything will be done easily .the chance of studying abroad is very possible and feasible today .i am 27 years old now and i visited england and i intend to visit america whereas my father for example has not leaved even for a neughboring country .so really young enjoy their life
