do you know this situation ?relaxing in front of the tv , watching a good movie and in the most exciting scene . ..advertisement . .. !watching it you will recognize that all products are shown there , the best , the healthiest and the chaepest .but are they really that good , advertisment is promesing use ?if you ask me , they are not !take for example pills or cremes that promise you not get older and look like an fivteen - year - old - teen while you are an 50-year old grandmother .this is , short to say , a lie .tests have shown that these cremes and all this stuff does not work and does not help you , to look younger and fresher , as it was promised .one of the best examples is the new coke zero .less sugar , even zero sugar but with the best taste you can imagen .so drinking coca cola will not longer be bad for your theeth and shape , the advertisment is telling us .but this is untrue .replacing the original sugar through chemical reproductions , the new coke affects in the same way our theeth and shape like the old one did .in addition to that , in germany there is at the moment a run on products indicating to you and shown in serveral advertisments , that after consuming them , you are feeling better and fitter .so called wellness-products .in this case the problem is the word wellness is not saved and everyone is allowed to use it .so now many producers in germany put the word wellness on their products and sell it to the people .people buy them , hopping to feel better but nothing will happen .wonder why , it is the same product as it was before only with an changed name which include wellness .so i think almost every product shown in television seems much better than it really is .consumers have to fight against this , because everyone has an right to know what is in the products and if the are helpfull or not .
