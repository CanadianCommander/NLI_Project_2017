i have a opposite opinion to the idea that after twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i have three main reasons for my opinion .first , cars are convinient than other vehicles such as airplanes and bikes .it is true that airplanes could travel faster than cars but it is not a vehicle that everyone could easily operate .in addition , i think more people are going to use cars replacing bikes .for example , when i was in hurry to school , i had to ride my bike since i did not have a car .it took me long time and i was late , so i have always hoped to have a car since then .other example is that when i took a train to go to the concert hall in suburb area , because it was rush hour , i had to be in overcrowded train .i did not feel good being smashed with lots of people .furthermoer , i had to walk to that concert from the train station because there were not any public transportation near that concert hall .this experience made me think that cars are more confortable and convenient than any other transportations .second , new technologies have made cars improve .some people argues that cars pollute air .however , since the technologies have developled electronic cars , it will not be bad for the environment .for example .i went to one town in switzerland , where only electronic cars were allowed .not only cars but public buses and trains were running by electricity .not until i found the electronic cars did i think that cars are not going to give bad effects in environment .finally , the price of the car will certainly go done .it is much cheaper to buy a car than in the past .this means that it would be easier for people to purchase a car .for example , if the car price goes down , people in developing countries would be able to buy cars .because the climate is bad in most of those countries , people would be happy to ride on a car rather than to walk on hot desserts .for the reasons above , i am convinced that more people are going to use cars in twenty years .
