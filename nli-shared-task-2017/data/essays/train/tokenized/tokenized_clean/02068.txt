although there are reasons to disagree with this statement , i agree with .indeed , successful people try to do a lot of new things .there are a lot of reasons i will support this opinion .first of all , if you want to be successful you have to be better than other people because that is the definition of success .in order to be better you must actually behave in another way than other people .then you have the chance to succeed .if you hope to be successful without doing things in another way than other people you have to be better than most of them .this is a very tricky task .that means that probably more people are successful who are risk-loving .a famous example is bill gates who was a highly talented student .however , he was not only better than other students he took also risks rather than the other students and founded a small company with the name microsoft .today , bill gates is the richest man allive .second , if you take risks it is highly possible not to reach the personal aim and you may fail .however , if you do not take risks it is not possible to reach high aims at all .maybe the possibility to fail is higher but it is also higher to reach your personal aims .finally , you must have the attitude to improve you characteristics all the time .that regards technical skills , for example to handle computer-problems , as well as social ones like the behaviour in groups .the willingness to improve yourself together with the the personal claim searching always the best alternative increases the probability to be successful .in conclusion , although there are a lot of risks trying new things and to behave unusualy , it is the only possibility to be successful , if you do not only trust in winning a lottery , because you have to be better than the others .
