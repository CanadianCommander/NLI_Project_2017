i think it is pretty hard to say this in general .maybe it is true for some people but false for others .but for the first part in life it may be true almost for everyone :let us start with the childhood age , usually the youngest one can remember .apart from several people , that go through rather harsh times during childhood ( divorce of their parents , deseases and so on ) usually people enjoy life to the fullest in that period .you have a lot of spare time , school is not so important to you and you do nt care about the future too much .so normally , you life a live that is free of sorrow and worries .after that , during teenage , it gets more complicated :many people get a little bit depressive , it is not called the difficultest age for nothing .in that phase of life , people usually do nt enjoy it that much .but there are always others , who go to parties a lot , and fall in love for the fist time and all that , so these ones will enjoy that time a lot , maybe even more than childhood .i am not sure which one of these is the bigger part , but i think , in general , most people would say , that this age was not as good as childhood .then , after graduating form high school , one either starts to work or begins to studiy at college .both ways of life have in common , that your free time gets more and more limited .either you have to work from nine to five , or you have to learn and pass compicated examinations .many people in that age are getting concerned about future .they may have fear of losing their job , or failing in some tests at college .besides that , in that age , you have to organize your personal life at the same time .there i think of founding a family and raising own chidren .so more and more your time gets less and your worries increase .but maybe there is light in sight at the end of the tunnel :there is a whole lot of people who start to enjoy life the most , when they are retired .they then have plenty of time again , and they do nt worry too much about the future anymore .so basically i would for most people it is enjoyable at the start and at the end of there lives .maybe like walking through a valley .but of course there might be very much exceptions to the ways of life i mentioned above .for example some people are either lonely or very sick at the end of their lives .in that case , there is no doubt , wheather they enjoyed life more when they were younger .
