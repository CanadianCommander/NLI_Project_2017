there are a lot of larning styles .depend on the purpose , the leaning style would be different .each person has different poit of view ; however , in my opinion , i agree that to understand ideas and concepts is more important that to learn facts for students .i believe that the important poimt of learning is how we can use that knowledge in our life .if we ca nt use the knowledge practicaly from study , it is no meaning .i think that to understanding ideas and concepts will help to use the knowledge more efficient way .first reason for my opinion is that we can learn a lot of things more deeply from understanding ideas and concepts .for example , when i learn history , if i think about the reason and concept , such as why our ancestor had a war or why they made a the low , i can learn a lot of things from the past .i believe that such a knowledge would be help to choose for the future .the second reason for my opinion is that it is more easy to memorize .for example when i studied to enter university , i just memorized a lot of knowledge such as historical date or vocabraries , however i forget these knowledge easily .i believe that if i did nt think about connection about facts , it is easy to forget and such a knowledge will be patent knowledge .if we think that we better use our knowledge more practical way , i think to understand ideas and concept is necessary .from understand these things , our knowledge will be use usuful things .
