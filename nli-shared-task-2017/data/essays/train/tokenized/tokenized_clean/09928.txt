regarding the statement , i disagree with the statement .i believe that people should study one specific subject for their knowledge and it make your life enrich .because you can learn a specific subject deeply that you are very interested in .also if you have a lot of knowledge for specific subject , it will be your asset and you can be a specialist at work .first of all , you usually select a major from your interest .it indecates that you are interested in your subject basically so you can learn lots of things from the subject .so once you can enjoy to learn the subject then you can also get lots of knowledge .on the other hand , if you learn many subjects that you are not so interested in , i suppose that it could not be useful knowledge .secondally , it would be expand your career options if you could get a lot of knowledge of specific subject .according to the recent news pepar , called nikkei , many companies tend to hire specialsts than generalists .because specialists already have knowledge for specific subject so a company does nt need to provide a training to them .but for generalists , they need get training when they start a job to get specific knowledge and skills .for conclusion , i would like to say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject that makes your life meanful and enrich .
