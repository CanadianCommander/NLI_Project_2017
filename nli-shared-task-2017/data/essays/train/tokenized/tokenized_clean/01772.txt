what is fun ?is it having no care in the world or is it having responsibilities that you enjoy ?there are differences in opinion of what fun is for various people .usually , the age at which one is young , free and ready to face the world is considered exciting and more fun .the question is , are we ready to say that older people can not enjoy life ?i do nt think so .when we are younger , in most cases , we have no responsibilities and only ourselves to think about .this leads to concentrating on only our needs and goals and hence attaining happiness out of it .but also , at this point in life , we need to think about the future and plan accordingly .this may lead to intense competition in academic life and a general stress .this is definitely not true always , but in most cases it usually tends to have a balancing effect on the fun , challenging the notion that we have more fun when we are young .once we grow older , have a career and family , our responsibilities are increased .this does not mean we can not have fun .by weighing all factors and getting into a career we love , we can do something we enjoy .and having a family can only be a good thing because you will have people who love you and care about you .sometimes we wonder how it is possible for many people to be so active and remain happy inspite of busy schedules .it is mainly because they enjoy what they do and love facing challenges .even after retiring and getting old , we can do those things in life that we always wanted to do , like reading our favorite books , going to our favorite places and experiencing life as never before .i think that the fun is in enjoying the little things in life that bring happiness , and having a positive attitude .therefore , if we finally define fun as enjoying what one does , i do nt think there is any difference whether we re young or old as long as we experience life in the way we should .
