nowadays , in korea , i think many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .instead , they spend their time on their own tasks .i d like to give you some of examples of young people in korea .the first example is that many young people say that they are helping their communities .they claim that they go to orphange or public places such as post office or police station in order to help their communities .actually , they are not going to the places in order to contribute to society .they volunteer in fake in order to get scores or fulfill the time required to go to high school or colleges .if the required time of volunteering is fulfilled , they do not volunteer any more .the second example is that , in korea , when a social matter occured , many young people protested against it and they continually protested until it was improved .however , nowadays , most young people are ignorant of the social matters .they only pay attention to their own .because of that , there are many social problems unsolved throughout the country .though the some young people are really spending time on helping communities , most of the young people do not help their communities .they only do their tasks .they do not give much attention to their societies .i think the main reason for this is that the ` individualism  which was spread to young people from european countries or america .we , koreans , should follow our tradition , which put a lot of emphasis on helping communities .if we behave like this , our country can not develp well .if we want to make a better country , we , young people should spend some time helping to the communites .these kinds of activities may not be hard .we can pick some trashes scattered in the streets or we can help disabled people in the road .we can give some of our money to poor people or we can visit hospitals or people in need once in a week .these might be not tough .instead of spending time on ourselves , we can help communities with those kinds of acitivities .through our efforts , we can make a better world .help communities !
