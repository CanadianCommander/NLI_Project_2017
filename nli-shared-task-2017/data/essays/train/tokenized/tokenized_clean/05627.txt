being old does nt mean anything , many people are old and still have fun .i really do nt agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .being young you might have more energy than a old person does .we all know that being young is a very good , we can go out and play football or basketball without worrying about breaking a bone .old people can also do that , but they just have to be more careful than the young ones .there are many old sports player out there still left in the world .for example there is brett favre who is hitting 40 pretty soon .i know that is nt really old , but in football that is a pretty old age .many old people can be very active in other business espically the arts .we all see many fashion designers , actors , and novelist who are all pretty old and still making good movies and writing good books and making beautiful clothes .helen mirren is a good example of an old actress who knows how to have fun .her performance in this years `` the queen  has her for a frontrunner to take home the academy award .many times its usually the young ones who get crtical acclaim for their performaces .you also see many old actor hitting the clubs like lindsay lohan and britney spears without their underwear on .you see bruce willis and george clooney who still hit the clubs .you also see many old fashion designers , who still make the best gowns for people to wear .many people might like zac posen or proenza schouler or the newest fashion designer that just graduated from parsons , but in the end people still like the old fashion designer such as oscar de le renta .in the end , i do nt agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .
