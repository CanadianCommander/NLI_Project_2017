do young people enjoy more than older people do ?to answer this question i must specify the meaning of `` enjoy  .enjoy is the ability to make the best possible use out of a given situation .enjoyment to one person might be different to another .a person might enjoy a particular thing while the same thing might be annoying to another person .young people enjoy in a different mannner than the older people .to the young enjoyment might mean partying , listening to rock , watching a horror movie etc .but to the old enjoyment might mean something else .they might enjoy visiting their grandchildren or might want to visit a park .there is enjoyment in both the cases .nobody can say that since the young person went to the movie he enjoyed more than an old person who visited a park .it is a general misconception that only young people know how to enjoy .the intensity of enjoyment varies .for example , a dangerous roller coster ride may be a pleasurable experience for some youngester but may not please the elderly .if you ask an elderly person what makes you happy or what gives you the most pleasure or rather what gives him enjoyment he might disagree with the views of the young generation .this does not mean that what the youngster likes should not be classified as a mode of enjoyment .it means that the way the older people enjoy is just different the way a youngster enjoys .eventually i would like to conclude by saying that i disagree with the topic `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .many people believe that what they enjoy the most should be applicable to others as well .but that is not true .people should understand that the mode of enjoyment for everyone of us is different and we should respect that medium whatever it may be .
