it is difficult to answer this question .young people have all their lifes ahead , everything is new .they have their dreams that they hold on to , and they are , usually , full of hope .older people on the other hand , have learned a lot already , and acquiered some wisdom .they see life and certain things like love less complicated .they had their experiences and are much cooler than when they were young .but young people have the advantage to be healthier and full of power and strength to live their youth and to make experiences themselfes .older people are more likely to get sick and to feel tired and weak .so maybe their bodys are not what they used to be .but the expierences they made and what they have learned about life and about themselfes helps them to take it easy .their mind is stronger .a old man laughs about this childish young guy who is so desperatly in love that he is not able to eat or to think , because he can only think of his girl .but he also envies him for being so strong and active and to have such intense feelings .this is something he lost on his way becoming a mature man .being young is an adventure , and you may enjoy it or you may regret it .it is full of action and impressions , but for me , maybe because i m young and have not experienced being old , i still believe that the future , in wich i will be old , offers me plenty of happyness .it will be different , though .i am quite sure it depends on every single person whether they are happier when they are young or old .but i have to admit , that even if i think that it only gets better , most of the old people miss their youth very much .but it can be joyfull to remember to !i think you should enjoy every age .but as the youth is more intense , i think that for most people the youth is the part of their lifes that they enjoy the most .
