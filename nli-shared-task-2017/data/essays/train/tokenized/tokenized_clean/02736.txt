i completely agree with the statement : even though facts are important , i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .in facts , sometimes ideas and concepts are behind a fact , they are the main causes of them : understanding them is the best way to have a real comprehension of the facts .i will show two examples that can support my opinion .in a scientific theory , for example the theory of gravity , i think that the most important thing to know is the main concept of the theory : an object is attracted by the center of the earth , because everything in the universe has a force of attraction because of its mass .this is the concept , the basic idea of the theory : understanding it it s more important than studying the formula .once i have understood this concept , i can study the facts : the formula of the earth s gravity , how scientists discovered this theory , what experiments were made in order to demonstrate it et cetera . ..in the same way , i think that is more important to understand ideas and concepts also in other subjects .for instance , it could be really important in history .for example , when someone has to study the period of the fascism , in italy and in europe in general , i think that a good comprehension of the fact should focus on the societies in these years , on the economical conditions of these countries after the i world war , on what people though after a terrible event that happened in europe before .facts , dates , events , are important , but in my opinion come in a second time .if a student does not understand that fascism can occur when a man with a big personality has the power where there is a particular , social and economical situation in a country , he will not understand the main causes of the event .on the other hand , if he understand it , he could understand the causes of fascism and why some european countries have had a dictatorship after the world war i .in conclusion , i think that ideas and concepts are fundamental in order to understand the causes of something , then facts derives from these causes .
