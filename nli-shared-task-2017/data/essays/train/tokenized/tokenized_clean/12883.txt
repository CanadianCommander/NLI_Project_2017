what is advertisement ?you developed a great product ( in your opinion ) and you want to promote it .that is the basic fact of advertisement .a good marketing specialist would do it aida-style .aida is a process in marketing .it includes the following steps : attention - interest - desire - action .the first point is getting your attention .therefor he must do something special like a big presentation or something else like a campaign ( e .on did something like that .it was everywhere in the media and no one knew it ) .if he got the attention , the interest must be build up .the following step is : advertisement .in advertisement he wants to show us that product from its best side .he counts up all positive skills and gimmicks .he shows anything in the product that is better than other products and so on .the next phase is building a desire for your product .best example for something like that is apple , who made a fashion brand out of ipod .in the last step it is up to you : you have to buy the product .sounds good so far .the problem is that there is not only one company and one product , there an almost uncountable amount of companies and products and anyone wants to sell their products .in some markets , where there is a hard competition , there is more promises made that can kept .this leads to a bad image , because if you buy an expensive product and it is working for only a few weeks , you are not a happy customer .if the number of unhappy customers grows , you will be soon a unhappy company .a few years ago advertising played not the role as it does today .the companies realized that their image depends from their products .they invest very much to make their products the best on the market , so that they can show us , that it is the best product .
