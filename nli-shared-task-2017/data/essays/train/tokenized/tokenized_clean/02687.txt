on the world market more and more new inventions and trends are available .there are some people who like to follow new trends and others who prefer to stick to more traditional things .both sides of the question offer advantages and disadvantages .some people are more afraid of uncertainty , that means they like to do , use or talk about things they already know in order to be sure about the outcomings .they do not like an unknown situation with unpredicable outcomings .this behaviour can be positive as no or only predicable risks are taken , but also a bit boring as there are little changes .the other group of people is more willing to take risks and try new and unknown things in order to improve their living situation and to be more successful .this kind of living behavior can bring a lot of advantages .first , you can not really proceed in your life if you do not give new things a chance .there must be room for inventions , otherwise it will be hard to keep path with your social environment .to underline my opinion , the example of a mobile phone is used .when it was first launched , many people were sceptical about this invention .those who were open enough to try it , had the risk about spending too much money as they choose the first and only tariff which was higher than other suppliers , but they were connected to the world .another example is the internet .it changed the whole world and people belonging to the group not willing to try new things have disadvantages .they are somehow disconnected from the rest of the world .in a business environment companies without the internet could not be successful and could not survive .second , people trying new things can have more fun and changes in their lifes .as they are open to new things they have the opportunity to discover so much more than the other group and find more opportunities to be even more successful .being careful about new things is important , but not adapting to any changes can be harmfull as well .in my opinion , everyone should somehow listen to an inner voice about how far one would go and how many risks one would take .but not moving and always keeping to old things can not improve a persons life .therefore , to put it in a nutshell , eveyone should try to keep path with its social environment in order to be successful , but not taking any risks one is not ready for .
