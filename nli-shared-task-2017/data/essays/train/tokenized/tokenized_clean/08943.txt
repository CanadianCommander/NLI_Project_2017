will there be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years time ?to answer to this question and determine whether i agree or disagree with the statement in question , first we must consider how several aspects of the world in which we live are going to develop in the future .factors such as the world fertility rates , oil prices , development of poor nations , technological improvements and damage to the earth , have to be taken into account .we must consider how these various elements will change and interact over twenty years , affecting the numbers of cars in use .it has been proved that world fertility rates are rising , specially in non developed countries .this means that the world population will grow during the next twenty years .thus , probably , there will be a greater number of potential car buyers .however , if large numbers of the world population remain poor , they will not have access to cars .the development of poor nations could raise the standard of living of people which are now poor and can not afford to buy a car .this means that in the future , large segments of the population of countries such as india or china could be using cars .however , this process is uncertain .on the other hand , factors such as oil price increases or damage to the earth may the cause the human being to focus on other possible ways of locomotion more cheap and enviromentally friendly .perhaps , in twenty years time cars will not exist any longer and we will be using other machines thanks to new technological advancements .in my opinion , there is a great possibility that emerging nations such as china and india will one day increase their number of car owners .the development of their economy is raising very rapidly the standard of living of their populations .in addition , their fertility rates are high .all this combines to make it very possible that they will have large numbers of car users in twenty years time .i also believe that human beings will still rely on cars to travel in the long term ; despite the improvements in technology .so , to conclude , i do not agree with the statement proposed .
