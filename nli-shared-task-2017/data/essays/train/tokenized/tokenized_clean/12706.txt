i agree with the opinion that one need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specified knowledge of one subject .there are two main reasons ; one is that the modern society needs someone who has multiple backgrounds , and the other is that one specific academic subject is limited to define the complexed reality .most of all , as a society is getting developed and modernized , it needs someone who has multiple knowledge of various subjects .as someone who is specialized in one specific subject has a limitation to utilize his knowledge and experience to other parts of the society , his value in this society will be reduced .for exmaple , my uncle , who works for samsung electronics , majored in computer science in university .because he does nt have any knowledge about the business and economy exept for the specified computer subject , he could nt make success when the company offered a good position in the business planning team .in addtion , one specified subject ca nt explain and define the complexed reality .in the past , it was possible to analize a natural or social phenomenon by using a specified knowledge and theory .however , in order to analize and define a modern phenomenon , we have to mix the various academic backgrounds and knowledge .for instance , when we analyzed the main reasons of imf period in early 2000 in korea , we had to utilize such many academic knowledge as politics , economics , socialogy , statistics , international economics and finance to get the correct answer .as a result , having abroad knowledge of many academic subjects is very essential in that the modern society needs someone who have various academic backgrounds and the complexed reality is hard to be explained by one specific subject .
