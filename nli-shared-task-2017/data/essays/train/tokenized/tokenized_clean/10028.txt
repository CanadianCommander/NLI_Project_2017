my opinion is disagree .i think young people should help their communities .i have two reasons .first of all , young people in other words , students have much time than working people .after school , many students have a part-time job for earning money .it is important for them to do a part-time job .they can buy many cloths , shoes , snacks , and so on .but , i want to recommend them helping their communities .this may free .but , they can know new things which do nt learn in the school .for example , they can know about old people .there are various people in communities .so they can talk with who they do nt usually talk .old people know many things than young people .secondly , young people live in their communities too .not only clean their own house but also a park , a road etc .m
