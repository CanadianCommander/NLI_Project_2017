every statement has two sides one is negative and other is positive .but i will take a balanced stand for the above statement .in twenty years there will be few cars in use , if technology advances as rapidly as one can think .on the other side , there will be more cars in use than today .firstly , if government tries to emphasize only on the profit making tasks then there will be very few cars in future .the people who are already in power tries to overcome the middle class and low class people .they will try to be at the highest level .on the other side of the coin , if goverment make some policy that rich people can own limited facilities .then other middle and low class people come into limelight .so they can start thinking of facilitation .secondly , if government concernd just with economy , then we can say that there will be fewer cars in the future .to maintain the system , government needs financial support also .if every one tries to buy a car , then there must be lowest economy level .it can cause the problem of valueless resources .thirdly , as the technology advances , rich people try to get the latest facilitation .but middle class people remain with their old cars .this advancement can be in face of less expensive things .so that other people can also purchase the same latest technology car .in sum , i conclude that the number of cars will be fewer if currency value will be higher .this number can be increased if currency value will be less .so currency level is dependent upon the economical state of the country .if the government is well concerned about the the growth and developement of the entire country then there will be higher numbers of cars in the furure .
