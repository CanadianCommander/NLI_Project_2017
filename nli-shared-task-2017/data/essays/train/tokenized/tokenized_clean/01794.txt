in the recent years , i ve travelled a lot around the world and learned about many different nations .i ve travelled mainly to the united states , europe and around the continent where i live , south america .many times you get lost or bored beacuase you are in a new place and with people you dont even know .so , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .tour guides are generally very experienced people and often know a lot about the place you are visiting .they know very well , and have studied the different places you are visiting , and also , they will answer any question you would like to know .for example , i went once to a guided tour with some university friends to sao paulo , brazil .this experience was amazing because in only six days i could learn a lot and maybe more of the history of the city than some native brazilian citizens .many people think travelling with a tour guide is too expensive , but the experience is worth of it .if you travel with a large group of people , you can divide the cost of the tour guide and you ll definetely enjoy your trip .also , when you travel with a large group of friends , you will have remarkable and unforgettable experiences of it .finally , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because tour guides are very experienced people , you also enjoy the trip a lot with the group of people you are travellng with , and this way of travelling is not so expensive .i ve done this a lot of times and it has worked out .what you can learn from a tour guide and the moments with your friends are memorable .
