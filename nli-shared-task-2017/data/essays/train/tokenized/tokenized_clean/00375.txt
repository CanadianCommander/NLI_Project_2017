i agree with the statement as it says , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are three advantages .first , as you traveling in a group led by a tour guide , tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey .for example , if you want to go sightseening , a tour guide will escort you to the sight .the tour guide will be resopnsible whatever traveler wants to do .they just don  have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activities .espeacialy when they can not speak english or german or whatever the languages are spoke in the country where they travel to .second , since go traveling with group , they will definately get along with each other and have fun .if traveling alone , it wo nt be able to have much fun as traveling with group .third , traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone .of course a tour guide knows about the location where is not safe enough to go so they wo nt go to the dangerous side of city .ever since transportations developed amagingly , the world gets closer .we can go to the another side of world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there .it used to take about two , three months to get to the other countires .the world is getting more dangerous , most of people have guns and knife .so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler .in my experienses , i have gone to australia by my own .it was still scary to go there by self .espeacialy in town side .when i went to town , i lost my wallet .i did nt lose my passport , thougt .so ever since i believe traveling with a tour guide is better and safer .
