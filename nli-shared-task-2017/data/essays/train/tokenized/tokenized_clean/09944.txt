i disagree with the argument that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years down the line than there are today .i can attribute a number of reasons to support my agreement of argument .the most important reason i consider is the recent technological advances to use non-conventional enery sources instead of conventional fuels like gasoline and diesel .although i agree that there is decrease in quantity of oil pools one can find out whcih are used to produce petroleum which in turn is used to extract gasoline and diesel , the main fuels that run cars today .further , scarcity of petroleum has lead to an exponential increase in the growth of petroleum product prices which directly affet the consumption of the product .we can see in the current times , petrol prices are rising at brisk rate and the trend will follow in the future also because of the limited availablity of petroleum resources .however , there are steps taken by companies , independent researcher to look for the non-conventional resources of enery like hydrogen , electricity as future fuels of cars but the experiments have not been successful commercially .i am sure that twenty years time is considerarably good amount of time that the non-conventional sources of energy will completely replace the exisiting conventional fuels .i assume that non-conventional fuels will replace the existing fuel technology in the future because they are easy to use , pollution-free .automobile manufacturing companies like gm , toyota etc. are looking forward to welcome these new non-conventional fuels and their research and development groups are persistently working on prototypes which are small boxes that can easily be replaced in existing cars .existence of this box will imply that we can just have this new box fitted and use different fuel and there is no need to change the car .that s why i think number of cars twenty years down the line will not be fewer because of the existence of non-conventional resources of enery and the adaptation that the vehicle manufacturing companies are doing to their products .
