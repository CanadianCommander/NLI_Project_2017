in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is definetly a very important advantage in life , but you should have also a broad knowlegde of other academic subjects , too .it is necessary to know about other academic subjects to use your special knowlegde in an effective way .for example , a manager has to know about much about politics , computer science and mathematics to use and handle his specific economic knowlegde .if a manager only knows about economic , he could nt do a good job .another advantage of broad knowlegde is , to use it easy in your normal life .it helps you having a good conversation with your business partners or other persons .when you only know about your own specific subject , it is not possible to talk with other people about their problems or the news in tv .on the other hand , concentrating on one special subject can help raising the career .for a scientist , for example , it will be a good choice to concentrate on only one academic subject , because he hardly can use other knowlegde in his job .when the scientist does nt get deep into his subject , he ca nt do a good job , because his task is , to find new things and think further than other people did before him .another advantage of specializing is , that you can be the best in your subject if you only concentrate on this one subject in your life .it is not possible to be the best in computer science , when you are focussed on other subjects at the same time .as a result , it depends on the person , his attitude and his job , what his best way of education is .for some people the best way is , to have a broad knowledge , and other people should better specialize .in my case , the best choice is to have a broad knowlegde , because i am still not quite sure about what i want to be in my life .after making a decision i can still specialize on one specific subject to be good in my job .
