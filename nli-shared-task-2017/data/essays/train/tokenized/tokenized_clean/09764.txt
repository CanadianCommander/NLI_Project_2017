the question wheter or not there will be fewer cars on the road in the future has been discussed by many articles .i do not think that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than today .the reason why i think the number of cars wo nt decline is based in the function a car has and the benefit of a car that humans apprecciate about owning one .it has to do with the attitude most humans seem to have , concerning cars .many people love their car and have almost an emotional relationship with it .they think of it as prestige and status symbol and use it for expressing themselves and making a statement of who they realy are .other poeple like the most about cars that they give them the opportunity to be flexible .a car gives the freedom to visit a place whenever the driver wants to and also gives the freedom to leave a place when wished .people reach freedom through cars .freedom is one of the most important values of western society .it is something that we do not want to give away .when we think about reasons why there could be a decline in cars on the street in the future , we often think about the often mentioned oil-scarcity or the dependency of western countries on oil-producing eastern countries .i am aware of the fact that those things are important and difficult to solve .but what makes me sure that the number of cars wont be reduced is the faith in new innovations .i believe that one day we realy need to find something new , there will be a new invention .one example for this can be seen in the case of the vw lupo , which is a car model that only uses up five liters of fill on 100 kilometers .this model was released shortly after oil prices rose up high .some articles sayed that vw had the car ready and was just waiting for the right opportunity to bring it on the market .i could imagine that car manufacturers also have the right idea of how to make driving possible in a true clean way , without pollution-causing engines and without using regular fill .furthermore , i think that once such cars are invented and accepted by a bigger part of population , they will be produced on assembly lines and in high ammount .this would make them available for many people .concluding , i think that the number of cars wo nt be reduced because people dont want to give away their cars , which gives new innovations the room to create a new car that can be driven without negative effects .
