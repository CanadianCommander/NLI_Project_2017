this is a very common question in pedagogical circles .sometime , it can become a very political questions .in fact you ca nt really decide to learn with one method .a student who understand the ideas and the concepts behind a course will have a good grade at the final exam .this method of learning allow a student to develop its own comprehension of a course .he can develop some `` ways of doing something better  .if he understand the course , he can also anticipate the next class subject for example .he can also ask some interesting questions to the teacher .in general , this method of learning develop the student s brain .he will be more reactive .for example , in a mathematic course , it is very dangerous to learn facts only .you need to understand the underlying ideas behind a theorem to understand it .years ago , i once decided to go to a math exam without praticing and understanding the course .the result was naturally bad because the professor wanted us to understand totally the concepts of his course !at the opposite , learning facts can be also a good manner to learn .some courses can be very complex and with very little time so the best manner to finish the course is to learn theorems for example without demonstrate it .also , in certain domains , like history or geography , you can only learn facts .there are not many things to understand .you just have to learn .in high school , i had a history exam .i just learned all the notes i ve taken during the course and i finally had a a-grade .i really think that understand ideas and concepts is the most efficient way to learn .i had the chances to have a lot of professors who teached like that .but in some really special courses , simply learning facts can be the best manner to succeed !
