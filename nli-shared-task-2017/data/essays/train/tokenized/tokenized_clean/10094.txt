i agree with this statement .advertisements only state the advantage of products .if the products have bad point , we ca nt notice it , because advertisements can hide the problems of products .there are many advertisements in our life , for example firstfood restrants , newspaper , magazines and so on .advertizements appeal the many good points of products to attract customer .if the products do nt have any advertizements , customers ca nt notice the existance of products even if products are new one , customer may be not able to recognize it .it is the big problem for the seller to sell the products a lot , so advertizements really affect the products to seem much better than they are .advertizements appeal the good points strongly , so they do nt state the bad points , even if the products have problems .many customers often see the good points of the product when they buy something , so they do nt take care for the bad points .therefore , if rthe company appeal the products with advertizements , customers ca nt notice the problems more , and customers think that the problems seem much better than they really are .advertisements really affect the products to be seen much better than the real .in conclusion , advertisements are the good factor to make the products seem much better than really are , because they can appeal the good points of the products , even if they do nt have .also , they can remove the bad points of products when they states , even if the products have issues .therefore , advertisements make products seem much better than they reall are .
