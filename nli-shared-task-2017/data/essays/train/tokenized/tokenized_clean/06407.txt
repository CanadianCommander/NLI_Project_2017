i agree with the opinion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better that just having studied one specialized subject .i believe that knowing many academic subjects widely would help people understand more about what you really want to learn .people can get many points of view from that .for instence , when you are studying economics you can not forget about international relationships which can change economy of the world .also you have to think about how thinking only about good economy system may causes bad effects on the natural environments .people can learn more about what they are majoring by knowing other academic subjects .there are also other reasons .not studying other subjects , which you thought not interesting may took your possibility .i had a friend who thought she does not good at mathmatics , but she gave herself one last chance to study mathmatics in the last year of high school .she ended up with finding that she actually like to study mathmatics .she have found her new possibility .to decide not to study a sbject with first impression of yours can be dangerous sometimes .you may miss your favorite subject .futhermore , studying many subjects widens your future .if a person only knew one specific subject , you may have a few choices of jobs .if a person studied many different subject , then those subjects can give him a lot of opportunities to think what he really want to do in the future .when i was younger i had a totally different job in my mind for the future , but studying many subjects in high school and university has changed my opinion many times .it is because i have found other possibilities for the future by studying many different things .to study many subjects will take time and a lot of effort .however without studying them you will never know your possibilities in the future .it is not too late to study specific subject after you have studied different things .
