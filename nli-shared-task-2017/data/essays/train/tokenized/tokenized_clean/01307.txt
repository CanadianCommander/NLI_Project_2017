i strongly agree with the statemet that advertisements drive us to believe their products are better than the truth .it s surely a way to attract more people to buy the products .but sometimes , the products are really make clients disappointed .for example : once a day , when i was too young , a university student knocked my room door while i was lonely in the house .she recommanded a type of shoes were very good .it could prevent from humid and firing .then it was magically to see while the skin of shoes , it did nt get firing .then a young girl curious as me thought it was very interesting , as a consequence , i bought it .but only after some days , i found the shoes have nt good texture and destroyed by walking .then from this advertisements , i take a lesson : do nt believe adversisements !when they claim some aspects are really good and attractive , it means in other aspects , maybe are controversal .when the claim something is high technology , maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed !but can we prevent the advertisements from daily life ?certainely not .watching advertisements is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of world .and some advertisements are too artical or storical which attact people very much .like microsoft s advertisements of pentium 4 .they tell us a new generation of computer , though the high-technique such as computer , mobile , mp3 improving very quickly .but they are the fashion .and for me , i think high-technique and make-up things are toys .they are changeable like the toys i play during my childhood .and they can be the discussion topics .it makes us more interesting .though their price are not reasonable .afterwords , though the advertisements always give us products not as good as they claim .but as a daily information , we ca nt get away from them .in a global world today , we also get benefits from advertisements .
