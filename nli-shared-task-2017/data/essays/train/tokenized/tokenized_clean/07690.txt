i agree that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide even though some people might prefer travelling on their own .first , people can make new friends in the tourist group .when one person travels alone or with his or her family members only , it is quite possible that he or she willl get bored .if people travel in a group , they can meet different people and make new friends with the group members during the trip .generally , tourists will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provides adequate time for people to get to know each other and make new friends .second , to travel in a group would bring more fun .when people travel alone , they might feel it is a pity that nobody shares this experince with them .while in a group , people can share this wonderful experience with the group members .the lasting memory of travelling would be enriched by the happiness added by the group members .third , it would be efficient and organized when the tourist group is led by a guide .the guide would arrange the travel in the best way , which means travellers need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travelling .travellers do not need to find information themselves and they do not need to worry about where to sleep at night , how to find the direction or how to take the transportation .in addition , the tourist guide can provide adquate information for the history and uniqueness of the scenic spots .the tourists only need to listen to the guide and enjoy themselves .because people can make new friends , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , i support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
