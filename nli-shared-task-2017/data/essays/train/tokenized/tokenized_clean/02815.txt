i do agree with this statement , because i think it is easier to use something you learned in your everyday life if you did understand the idea or the concepept of what you learnd .for example if you learn something in physics , like electricity , you learn these formulas and you can for example say , how high the voltage is or something like that but if you are not understanding what you are doing you ca nt keep that in mind .that s the way it is with me , i just can remember stuff i really understood .i am a trained vet nurse and i learned a lot about so many different types of animals but you never can help them fighting their deseases if you are not understanding the whole system of a body .and it does nt help you just to learn it you have to understand it .the understanding of a concept gives you also the possibility to transfer things you learnd for something special to other things happening in your life .like in maths if you are not just learning that facts to use it in school you can use it in your home for example to reorganize your room in a better way by using formulas you learnd .i think the best example to see how this works are kids .you tell them that the fire is hot , so that is a fact .and they know the fact that the fire is hot but they ca nt understand what hot means .so in most cases the kids touch the fire and then they know what is meant when there parents say `` it is hot  .and they can transfer it to every other thing in there everyday life like the oven .if their mother says it is hot , they do nt dare to touch it because they understood what is the meaning of hot .so in the end i think it is always better to understand the idea of what you are learning , because just in that case it is easier for you to use it in your life and it is so much easier to keep it in mind .
