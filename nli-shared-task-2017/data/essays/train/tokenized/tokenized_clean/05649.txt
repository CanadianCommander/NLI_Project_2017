giving a real contribution to the community is an important social aspect .in my own opinion the time dedicated to this purpouse should take a part in the life of any of the members of a community .i disagree with the statement because i think that young people nowadays is the most invoved in helping their community .many of my friends give their contribution to different social assotiacions and they do not earn money for that .they simply do that because they believe in the importance of their help .i think that young people is more involved in helping communities rather than grown ups .this could be ascribed to the different amount of time which they have .grown ups are more likely involved in career and in family so they are not able to dedicate a large amount of time to this purpose .instead , young peole has more free time and , in addiction , less worries to deal with .therefore is reasonable that they use this chance to help other people in the community .however , acccording to me there is also another reason for young people is larger involved in giving their time for the health of the community .a young man is tipically more idealistic and full of enthusiasm .therefore we can immagine how a boy can enjoy the idea of helping people spontaneusly .on the contrary a father might prefer to use his time and his sources to help his own family .in conclusion i think that young people firmily believe to share their time and sources to help the community .the result , can be seen in all the widespread activities and no profit association that we commonly meet .therefore i am pretty proud of the way the people of my age deals with the need fo help in the community .
