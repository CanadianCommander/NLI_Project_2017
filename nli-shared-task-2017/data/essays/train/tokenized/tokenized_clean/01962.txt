nowadays , people are used to living with their car in such a daily way that most of them could not act without it : going to their job , doing their shopping , and so on .on the other hand , the increase of oil price seems to lead people to think of using their car less .as a consequence , such a controversial situation can make us to wonder what the future is destined for cars .to my mind , even if ecology may act so that in twenty years there is fewer cars , there will be as many cars as today or even more .first , in my opinion , we must consider the situation in states which are developing , in order to have an idea of the future about such technologies .indeed , in countries such as india , people ca nt afford a car for every members of a family yet , like it is the case in the united states , but in twenty years the state will be more developped and the citizens might have more money and thus might be able to buy more cars which stay a sort of myth of success .hence , even if new better technologies were put in place , they would be too expensive for the developping states , and that s why i believe that there wo nt be fewer cars .secondly , the habits and the economy are not to be changed staight away and people may be going on buying cars .as a matter of fact , people are used to driving themselves everyday and everywhere ; as a consequence it would be difficult to make them to use other means of communication .for instance , although students have a large access to bus and metro , parents still buy a car to their children for their majority in the united states ; more than an indispensable object , it is a symbol of freedom and of wealthy .otherwise , the factories are not also ready to give up their usual product , and this all the more since it is very expensive to look for new system of communication .therefor , i think that the car is so integrated in mentality that it will take more than twenty years to change is place , and so people will still buy cars .finally , from my point of view , news technologies will permit to improve cars , in particular about oil necessity and pollution , however they wo nt lead to the end of cars .indeed , i think that scientists will find new manner to make the car to function but i fear they wo nt find such a revolutionary means of communication that people will no loger buy cars .for example , even if tey find a new product , they would have to adapt roads , to make it not too much expenseive and to answer to all the demands .it seems to me that is more o project for fifty years than twenty .for all these reasons , i think that they will not be fewer cars in twenty years ; this useful tool is part of our life for still many years .
