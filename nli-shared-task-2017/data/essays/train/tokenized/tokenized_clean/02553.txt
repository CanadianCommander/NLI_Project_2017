global warming , cold , the ozone layer becoming thinner . ..etc .what do you think is causing these problems ?yes .it s mostly because of cars .we all know that cars are polluting environment and causes many diseases .and yet , we re still using cars very often .why ?it s because it s fast and comfortable when it takes us to our destination .i disagree that there will be fewer cars 20 years later .in my opinion , even the time goes to 2026 , the cars will still be our number one trasportion .there are some reasons why i think this way .first , cars are very fast .it s much fast than running and walking and biking .even though there are buses and trains , it s crowdy and also too big and slow for us to use for our daily lives .but cars are different .it s fast and comfortable .it can took us to the destination in short period of time .unless we can invent transportation which is as fast and comfortalble as car , i think we will still use car in 2026 .second , cars are private for one or one s family .you ca nt really talk private things in the bus and train because it can annoy people around you .also , you ca nt really talk privately since there are many people listening .however , in car , you can talk freely since there are only your mate or your family in the space .not to mention that you can use car anytime you want .third , cars have unique design .some rich people even collect many cars .unlike other transportation , you can decorate your car in what fassion or color you like because it s quite small and cheaper than the other transportation .nowadays , as technology developed , you can also do many things in car .for example , you can listen to music , watch tv , cook some food , etc .i think even the time flows 20 years , we will still ca nt find transportation like cars , which has unique design and many uses .i think cars are great transportation to humans even though time flows to 2026 .but , polluting the environment got to be stopped .many scientists are developing new ways to find resourses , such as solar energy , wind energy , tide energy and so on .i hope to see a wonderful car without polluting air in 2026 .
