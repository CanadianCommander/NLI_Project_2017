old temples , beautiful japanese trees , and traditional japanese snacks and food .kyoto is one of my favorite places to travel .on the contrary , tokyo is where modern lives of japanese people can be observed .high buildings , crowded streets , and fetid smells of smogs .but what if you do not know anything about japan and would like to travel ?would you rather buy a tour package led by a tour guide ?the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide because of lack of personal preparetion , flexibility , and personal experience .the first reason that a tour guided by a guide is not recommended is that people tend not to prepare by themselves .it is true that a guide knows the places the tourists will go and prepare plans for them .however , it is very uninteresting for tourists to go places without personal preparation .for example , if you are interested in japanese history and go to kyoto , it will be a great pleasure .rather than the guide telling you what happened in horyu-temple and why kinkaku-temple was constructed , if you learned by yourself and are interested in , it will be more great excitement to go there .in addition , lots of information are easily available online or in books , you do not have to get a tour guide to travel around .thus , you can prepare by yourselves to fit to your own interests and excitement .the second drawback of a tour guided by a guide is lack of flexibility .the plan is so rigid that you do not have freedom to spend your time as much as you wish .the guide shouts , `` get off the bus at 2:15 pm , and come back at 3:15 pm .be sharp ; otherwise , other people will be annoyed .how does it sound ?on the other hand , if you find a place is so boring and have to stay for three hours because of the schedule of the tour , how do you feel ?in addition , the plan of the tour does nt necessarily reflect your interest .mostly , the plan by a guide is so generalized that the places you will go are more likely famous places .for example , i went to france primarily to see the iron chuck which is the standard of measurement because i am interested .is there any tour like that ?lastly , the first and second disadvantages of a tour led by a guide strongly relate to lack of personal experience .if you prepare by yourself and go to the places to learn something more , the journey will be very brilliant .if you have a travel desined by your own tastes and favorites , the journey might be difficult but be unique .if you find the place uninteresting and dull , you can change your plan .if you find a better restauraunt to eat , you can just hop into the restaurant .all these experiences will be so precious , personal , and luminious .in conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide due to lack of personal preparation , flexibility , and personal experience .yes , travel with a guide might be safer and knowledgble , but getting personalized and unique experience in travelling is the most important .
