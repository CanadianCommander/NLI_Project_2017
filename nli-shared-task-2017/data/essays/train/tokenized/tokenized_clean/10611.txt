there are certain considerations which everyone takes into account to answer this issue .people may think about how useful is a car for themself , does it make my life easier and if he or she can imagie to live without a car .the most of the people would more or less think that the values above are important to them .when someone asks his  herserf the question : `` do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?the answer depends on a lot of factors such as his own experiences he had with cars in the past .after stating that everyones opinion can differ about this , i am confirmed that the amount of cars which will be used in 20 years will increase .i guess it is a broad accepted agreement that cars makes life easier .they can take you to far away laying places in a pretty luxurey way .and the way of traveling must be convenient for the humans .futhermore , you konw , it is a fact that the amount of cars still become bigger .a lot of people ca nt imagine a life without a car , i assess that they depend on the existence of cars .for exaple , today i came from stuttgart to heidelberg to take part at the toefl .and if i had nt taken the car , i would have spend lwice the time in a bus or on the train .ok i agree that this is a question of luxury .but do nt want to miss it .as an engineer i think that we are able to find a new method to get the cars not as harmful as they still are , for nature and for our nature .you know i mean the smoke which is caused if you take a car .and if the gazoline or oil becomes less , i gess , we will find a solution .the last thing which came up into my mind is , that germany has a great automotive comanies which are interested in selling cars .
