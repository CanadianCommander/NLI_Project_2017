advertisements usually make products seem much better than they really are .when a person walks down the street or is walking around in a mall , they are able to see all kind of flyers that exageratet the best characteristics of the products they are advertising making them look better than what they are .from my personal experience i can say that this is true .once when i was around twelve a company called me to see if i wanted to do a comercial for a new cookie that was going to be sold in panama .since i was a kid and they were going to pay me , i said that i would do it , no problem .when i got to the place , they handed me a script , i was suppose to eat the cookie , and it didnt matter if it was good or bad but i had to pretend that i liked it anyway .i went to work with other kids that were going to make that cookie look good .when we started filming , instead of handing us regular cookies out of the box they were special cookies , these were taken appart and they had been added double fudge , so they lookked better , and they were made presentable by some guy who was fixing the vanilla fudge inside the cookie with a knive .instead of us using normal cookies from the package , they had to make special cookies that looked better than what they reallt tasted , because i can surely say that the cookies looked good but they didnt really taste that good .not only this happens with food but also with toys .for example the hot wheel comercial for kids look great .on tv you would think the cars are able to do flips and land back on track and keep going no problem , but once you buy that item , the thing falls appart .the wheels of the car start falling , it jumps out of the track to never land on it againa , and to put the track together is almost as hard as trying to build a rubiks cube .in conclusioin items in advertisements always look better than what they really are , so people can sell them .this is a selling technique , but you have to be careful , because you can exaggerate what an item does , but you can make it up .therefore , to be able to sell something , in the advertisement it has to look better than what it really is , and that is what people usually do , and based from my experience i think that is exactly what goes on .
