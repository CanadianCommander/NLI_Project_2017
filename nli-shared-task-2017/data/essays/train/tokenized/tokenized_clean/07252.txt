the idea in question is that whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities or not .i personally feel that the statement is valid and absolutely true .the benevolence and the kind of caring that young people posses have dwindled down the years .firstly , young people are faced with stiff competition from their peers nowadays than they previously faced .this requires them to work very hard in order to earn a decent job and to even have a dignified life .young people of late , being over burdened , are obsessed with their own lives and the adage ` the survival of the fittest  is becoming more and more appropriate and hence they have very little time to devote to the society .the community matters are clearly second preference subjects for them .secondly , set aside the young people , the ethical and moral values and feelings of attachment with society have reduced over the years in all people both young and old .today , we boast of internet facilites and other advances of technology that help us to easily keep in touch with a large number of people but we are hardly bothered about the person who lives the next door !all segments of the society , whether young or old , have become more egotistic and insouciant to the needs of their community .and hence young people have naturally followed this trend of being indifferent .lastly , the communities nowadays are many times larger than the communities that had existed previously .in older communities , every member of the community knew every other member and they coexisted like the members of the same family .but in modern times , small communities are replaced by gigantic metros and cosmos where millions of people dwell and hence the community , which is typically a small congregation of people with shared interests , is displaced by huge groups of people that can no longer be logically called communities !people have diverse interests and thus there is a drastic decrease in their interdependancy and the need to co-operate .thus , young people who are a subset of the these people have become naturally inconsiderate about the needs of their communities .to sum up , i feel that the statement ` young people nowadays do not pay any heed to their communities  is indubitably true .young people in the modern times have become narcissitic and more selfish .they put themselves first and are more concerned about personal gains rather that progress of the community as a whole .
