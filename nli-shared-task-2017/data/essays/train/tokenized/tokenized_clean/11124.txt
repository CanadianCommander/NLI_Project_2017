yes , i agree that students must have to understand the ideas and concepts .but not by simply learning the facts .by understanding the ideas and the concepts one can have the ability to improve his grasping power and the creativeness , because when a student learns only the facts he can just have some information about the topic but he ca nt even know the concept behind it .but by understanding the ideas and the concepts some kind of inventive thinking can be improved by that student .for example , while doing work on maths , if a student just learns the formula to solve that problem but not the concept it makes a big difference .but by learning the concept the student can work freely not only on that problem but can also have some idea on related problems too .now a days in this fast generation students are being very fast .so they need to know well about the ideas and the concepts in every aspect .well by knowing only the facts on any aspect makes the students to have some book knowledge but that is not sufficient for them they must also have some ideas and concepts too .in any aspect like software and computer , the student must and should have the idea about the whole system and also the concept for well use of the system and the software .its merely waste of matter that if the student just learn about the system and the software .its the only way for building up proper skills in a student is to understand the ideas and should have proper concepts also .so , according to me i feel that for every student its more important to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
