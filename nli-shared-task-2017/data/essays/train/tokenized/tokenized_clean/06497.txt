we see uncountable several advertisements in our daily lives .people use many tools and methods in order to send information contained in several advertisements , and spend much time and money in order to make them attractive to purchasers .why do they fervently make their efforts to make that many advertisements ?that is because the advertisements have huge influences for customers .then , what is my opinion about the statement ?i strongly agree with the point that most advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are because many skills for making advertisements have been developed , and production of advertisements has a clear purpose .firstly , we should pay attention to the development of various tools and skills for production of advertisements .many people may feel the fascinating development of advertisement making methods , such as computer graphic design .in my case , i esperienced that advertisements make it possible for products to seem better than real one .i ordered a brand new mp3 on web site .it was awesome , and looked the best among which i had ever seen .i ordered it without hesitation , and i received it a few days later .however , the mp3 looked so poor .it was not what i had seen on web site .however , unfortunetely , it was exactly the one which i ordered .i came to realize the power and ability of advertisements .secondly , i believe that the statement is a main purpose of advertisements .many people , who request advertisements or make them , try to achieve that purpose .they spend huge money and time in order to make a great advertisement to make their products seem better .according to the principle of market , if advertising company do not make a good advertisement as much as it accomplishes the purpose of the advertisement , any advertisement can not survive .therefore , as a result of that , we would be able to see gradually developed and attractive advertisements .in conclusion , i am sure that advertisements can make it possible for products to seem much better than its reality .
