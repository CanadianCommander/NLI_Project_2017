gone are the days when grandparents were taken in charge by their children .a lot of people are nowadays under the impression that young people are less and less helping their communities .however , in the view of the actual situation we can say that the community life has deeply changed .thus , i think that young people are as involved in this community life as before , but in a different way .firstly , we must consider the every day life of the young people , which enable them to help their communities .for example , there are a lot of jobs that are directly related to the community .the growing part of ageing people in our society brings out a need of assistance , this trend generates jobs , which can be considered as helping the community and are really favoured by unemployed young people .this way of helping is all the greater as it is supported by the government : it created some jobs of educators in suburbs .these jobs are designed for young people they know well this environnment , and are really helpful for their communities .secondly , there are a lot of young people who are working as volunteers in caritative associations : for example , a lot of students want to give a sense to their life by this way .some french caritative associations like emmaus or secours populaire are now overcrowded by volunteers who want to act for social reinsertion of homeless people .the recent demonstrations of young people in france also demonstrate that they want to be concretely involved in the evolution of their society .this fundamental possibility and this political awareness shows their great desire to help their communities .the young people are currently helping their communities in a different way than before : they are now quite independent , and they are no more asked by their parents for help .nevertheless , they choose to be involved in associations or they favour jobs that are useful for the community .
