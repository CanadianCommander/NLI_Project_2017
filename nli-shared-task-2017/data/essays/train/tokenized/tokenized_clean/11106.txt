the question asked is if students should focus on learning facts , or rather on understanding ideas and concepts .this issue has a big importance because it is linked to the teaching style addopted by schools and universities , as well as , to the learning approach that students should choose .in my opinion learning concepts and ideas is better than studying facts .i belive it is not effective to learn facts because facts are generally linked to one particular situation or experience .many times this facts are from the past .on the other hand , concepts and ideas can be applied to a bigger number of cases and during a longer time .for exemple , what happened during the second world war is already in the past , but the concept of war is common to many situations of this type .based on this idea , i am convinced that it is more effective to understand concepts and ideas .furthermore , it is reccommanded to study concepts because the prcess of understanding a concept stimulates and develops thinking skills .for instance , when a student concentrates on the concept of accounting rather than on memorising the balance shit , he or she will be able to understand much more , like the idea of imput and output , in general .due to this fact , i think that studyig concepts is superior to learning facts by heart .finally , i believe that concepts are easier to memorize than particular facts .because concepts can be associated to so many situations and to so many mental images , they remain in our mind a very long time .moreover , concepts tend to become part of our mind , of our permanet way of thinking , but facts do nt .for exemple , if we understand the concept of trade , there are so many situations we can link this to , like ancient silk trade , slave trade , modern trade , so on .because of this , i prefer studying concepts and ideas more thad learnig facts .in conclusion , the facts that concepts can be applied and linked to more exemples , that they stimulate thinking and are easier to remember , demonstrates that studying concepts is a better option .i believe that while studying a concept , a student reaches higher levels of intelligence and of efficiency .
