ever consider that what the world will look like if there is no expert on medicine , computer sciece and engeers ?why would a company hire someone if he or she just have a general knowledge or without certain special skills ?can you imagine the rapid development of morden sciecen and technology whithout specialized knowledge ?i really believe that people should have sbjects in specialized field .firstly , mordern society need a proper distribution of worker groups that have special skills and serve as special purpurses .in fact it is the experts from differen areas that give us the life facilities .if all the people have a general knowledge in our society , there will be specialized madical services , convenient trasport system .secondly , it will be very helpful for people to get a job if he have been trained in special areas .certain companies deal with certain issues concerned with our life .if you have a very deep and specialized skills , you are more likely to be heired by a company .on the other hand , if all the people have the same trainning with the same background knowledge , it is hard to say that company will benefit from their stuffs  comman performance .finally , the constant accumulation of knowledge of certain specialty need the constant effort that experts have to contribute .every single acdemic specialty need new improvement of its own .if every one have the same background , it is hard to believe that science will be going on .in fact , knowladge of special field brings a much deep understanding of certain area .however , people should , in some distance , have a general information about what the whole world is like .a general knowledge will cast some ideas to special area .for example , biologists get the concept of computing the huge information presentede by thousands of billions of dna code .and also , a broader interesting about the world will give people a more freer and opener mind .but if we caculate the whole advantages of speicial subject , i would claim that special trainings should be obtained , only for the benefit of the society and ourselves .
