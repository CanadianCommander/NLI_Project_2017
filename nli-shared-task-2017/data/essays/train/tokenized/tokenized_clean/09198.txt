it is difficult to become an expert in one specific subject without a good knowledge in other different subjects , but it is unproductive and unuseful towards society to have a general knowledge but not the possibility to get a specific role .attending the architectural university i have realised how many other disciplines this subject can refer to , history , geography , medicine , astronomy , maths , physic , chemistry . ..and many more .so my profession will be one and well defined , but it will be the result of differents studies .in conlusion i disagree with the statement proposed , but i disagree even with its opposite , i think the truth is to be found into the middle .
