i firmly agree with the statement that knowing several subjects and being polyvalent in various fields is much more important that specializing in one topic .in nowadays society , things change so fast that the minute you start a career or a specialization , the minute the facts and figures of the subject have changed .this essence of broad knowledge is what makes people succeed in the world .unless you are 100 % sure that you vocationally want to specialize in a subject , the risk of not finding a suitable job because of the deviation of job offering is too high .both in terms of time and money .for instance , imagine that you decided to study telecommunications sometime around the internet boom .after you completed the 5 years of hard work , you get out to society with high hopes and great expectations and suddenly you realize that the world has no need for telecommunication professionals anymore because the market crashed down !then you would most probably regret not to have chosen a more general engineering diploma such as an electronical engineering degree .take the example of a devoted music student that really loves to play music to the point that he drops classes so he can go and play his music .perhaps , he will become a succesful singer or solo player , but the chances that he fails are there and when that really comes true , he will not be able to attend university classes because he did nt passed highschool .good and innovative ideas often are the result of composing other ideas .if on one side , you know how pollution of carbon dioxide is chemically produced and on the other , you are an expert on plant species , perhaps you can find a way to create a system to purify the air in the world .and moreover , if you have skills of marchandising and marketing , you can probably be in the forbes  next month main page .think that you can always specialize in the future .going from the trunck of a tree to the tip of a branch is easy , but getting from one tip to another tip is , literally , as going back in time .
