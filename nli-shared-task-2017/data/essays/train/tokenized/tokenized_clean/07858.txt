personaly , i prefer to learn broad knowledge , and i believe that broad knoledge would be helpful for a person anytime .therefore , i agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject .of course , i guess other might explain equaly valid for learning one specific subject only .in fact , i am planning to enter the phd course in a guraduated university .for phd study , we need specific knowledge and it is better to know specific research area deeply than to know wide area thinly .however , even if i consider the above goodness , i believe that it is better for all people to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .why i believe this is follow :first , i think all most all people do not deep knowledge so much .on the contrast , broad knowledge is neccessaly when a person face some troubles which are unfimilire to solve it .whenever we live , we can not do well if we do not our various knowledge .that means we are children .a child can not live alone if their parents do not help her or him .second , i believe that it is essential for researcher also to have wide knowledge .for example , when i could not write a research paper well and stoped my idea , i will read books or watch tv .sometimes i can get useful idea from media .in addition , if i have broad knowledge , i would be able to discuss the problem on research by various aspects .that s why i prefer to learn wide academic subjects .considering the above all reasons , i agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject .
