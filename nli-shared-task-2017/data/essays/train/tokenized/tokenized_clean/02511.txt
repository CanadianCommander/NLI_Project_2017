`` young people enjoy life more than older people .that is a statement which i do not necessarily agree with , due to a variety of reasons based on the sheer wording of the statement , as wellas other issues like the current circumstances of individuals , their definition of `` enjoying life  and what activities it involves .the very first issue that needs to be addressed when discussing this statement is how we are to characterise the `` young people  and the `` older people  ?does young mean children , aged 1-12 while older is above that ?or does young include all pre-adults and older include those beyond 21 ?the terms `` young  and `` older  are very subjective and therefore greatly limit the credibility of this statement .in order to be as precise as possible , for the purposes of this response , let us assume that young people fall into the age bracket of one to twenty nine years of age , while older people are above thirty .the pleasures involved with enjoying life for young and older people vary tremendously , based on the stage of life in which they are .for instance , a child could derive immense pleasure from spending a day on the beach , simply building sand castles .on the other hand , an older person could derive even more pleasure from driving a million dollar sportscar .how can we measure the relative enjoyment received ?therefore , without being able to do so , it is impossible to make a claim that young people enjoy life more than older people .it is possible to argue that in general , the pleasures of the young are more simple and pure as they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have jobs to go to every morning and a family to support .looking at it from this angle makes it seem like young people have the better life .however , another way to look at it is that at a younger age , people tend to have more restrictions placed on them , like parental rules , school codes etc , while adults or older people are free from such restrictions , to a certain extent , which gives them unlimited access to enjoyment .older people also tend to have stronger financial capabilities that enable them to enjoy many perks of life that youngsters do not have access to or can not typically afford .therefore , for the above stated reasons , i can not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because that involves having to make many assumptions which are unrealistic .it all depends on the individual himself/herself , the circumstances in which they live , their likes , dislikes , their personality traits and so on .a child could enjoy his life just as much as an fifty year old adult .there is no limit that can control such a feeling and so agreeing with the statement is completely out of the question .
