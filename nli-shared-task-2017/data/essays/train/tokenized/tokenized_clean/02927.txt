moneyhuman beings live on the world for thousand years , but they all live for the same thing , to earn money .every morning people go their jobs to earn money .everyone has a different job suach as ; cooker , teacher , driver , ...etc .also there are people who owns a industry .they produce different products on their industries but they all try to produce the best of it .there are also people who cheats while they are working .for example they show their products much better than they really are like some newspaper publishers .some publishers says that our newspapers have different subjects or different aspects or topics for news , but when you buy that newspaper you see it that they are the same with other newspapers .to sell their products they lie to people to show their products much better than they really are .i disagree to this following statement because those people who are trying to earn money by showing their products seem much better than they really are cheaters , and those people are not working on equal way .i mean everyone is equal on the world and no one has a right to lie to sell more prodcuts of they produced .this is not fair .this is the reason that i disagree to the statement .maybe the reason is those people make products seem much better than they really are to earn more money by making people buy their products but this can not be an excuse .i belive that people must not cheat or lie to earn more money , because these things can cause big problems to those people .for example if people learns that industry owners are lie to sell more prdocuts those people stop buying those products so those industry owners stop earning money .
