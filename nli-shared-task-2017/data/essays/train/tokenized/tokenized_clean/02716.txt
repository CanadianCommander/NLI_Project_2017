young people are usually the subjects of criticism .older generation tend to criticize the younger people mainly for the cultural differences created over the course of time .for instance , it is not difficult to hear complaints by older people that younger people these days are less polite and that young people are blamed for destroying the right usage of words and instead , creating slangs .however , these are problems simply created from discrepencies between generations .the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities also is one of these unjustified criticisms or simple misunderstanding .for various reasons , whether it is from warm-hearted sympathy or simply for college admissions , young people nowadays actually spend more time in social services .they also tend to participate more as a community member due to increase opportunities for them .in the generations of grandmothers or even fathers , there have not been such vigorous demand for good education .as the generation moved on the the information age , better education is highly preferred against primitive education .the general trend of the united states is moving toward marrying men with college degree ; a recent study showed that those without graduation certificates are having much more difficulties in marriage .due to this increasing demand of higher education , young people these days are preparing to receive better education in more famous colleges .the colleges insist that students should demonstrate not only academic abilities but also their participation in communities and social services .in fact , i have seen some students in my high school with more than 300 hours of community work .when i went to a camp , i met a girl who was awarded for doing 1000 hours of community service .although there is another hidden purpose of getting advantage in admission to better colleges , as a whole , these young people are helping their communities more .in addition , it is important that the definition of helping the communities is not limited to mere social services .helping the communities might mean serving as a part of a club , or even attending certain institutions .compared to the past , there are many more opportunities for young people to be involved as a member of their communities ; for instance , there is well-known club called interact club that help the society through activities like fund-raising or car wash .attending institutions such as libraries or working as internship in local hospitals , in the long run , produce much more educated and experienced people , which is beneficial and helpful to the communities around them .it is true that there are several traditioned ruined due to the rapid rise of young generation ; yet , it is not right to criticize the young people blindedly .though it may not be from the warm-hearted sympathy , younger people tend to participate more in community service for the admission and are more of direct parts of the society due to increased opportunities .with increased propaganda or campaigns on televisions that people who are warm-hearted and know how to appreciate the communities around them are more preferred over cold-hearted selfish people , there is no doubt that the number of people helping their communities will increase even more in the future .
