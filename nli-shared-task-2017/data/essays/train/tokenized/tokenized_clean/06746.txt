i think that succesfull people always try new things and take risks .as a matter of fact everybody can do what he already knows .it is very easy repeating something many times , it is like to copy ; but every man is able to copy .and how can something that everybody can do getting you to be a succesfull people ?i think the answer is that it ca nt .moreover nothing can be done radically better whitout making a change .without changement there could not be innovation and improvement .i think it is the same in the human condition : a person will always remain in the same condition without trying new things .that is not a characteristic of sussesfull people that , instead , always try to improve their condition .naturally taking risks is not a synonimous of having succex .someone succed in improve his condition , on the other hand another man fail .but to become a succesfull man it is necessary to try .however this imprevedibily is another point in favour of my theory .if try new things would get automatically to a succex condition , why some man do not try them ?the answer is simple : there is the risk to fail .fail means get you in a worse condition .and only a few man can risk to become in a worse condition .so only few man become succefull people .in conclusion only try new things can change man condition .it could become better or not .changing it in a better way means improve your condition and improve your condition makes you a succefull man .
