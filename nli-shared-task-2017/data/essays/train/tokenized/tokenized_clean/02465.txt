with a broad knowledge you can understand the world and with a specialization in a subject you may be the most recurred person in the whole world .which path should one take ?that s a topic that many young people deal with .let s discuss some relevant points .having a broad knowledge of many essential subjects , such as history , mathematics , biology and language is not only important in order to climb the latter of education but also for the development of one s ideas , personality and tolerance towards others .you can be able to understand the world , draw conclusions and interrelate the different subjects , and therefore have a deeper and more coherent view of things .for example , if you have learnd about darwin and his theory about the `` survival oh the fittest  and have a knowledge in history you would know how this biological theory applies in society , in which powerful and wealthy people rule most of the time .on the other hand , being specialized in one specific subject could mean being the most known person in that area and people will recurr to you more than to anyone else who does not have the knowledge you have on a specific matter .you may not understand the whole world , but have answers to questions and are able to analyse things that no one else could .for example , if you have a unique disease , a bacterial infection , you would recurr to a specialist in that area and not tho your grandfather that has a very broad cultural knowledge .in my opinion you should nt choose one path but both .throughout your whole life you should be interested to expand your broad knowledge , let it be by studying or travelling .it is indispensable to know about many subjects in order to understand each of one , since everything interrelates in one world .broad knowledge is the basis of your futher area of study that you may want to pursue if you are interest in a specific matter .
