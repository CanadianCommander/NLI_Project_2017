in my opinion successful people try new things and take risks rather than simply doing work on things that they already known .in my opinion a successful person is a one who never stops working and who has a eager to discover new things not just by stoping after some successful work because he know the importants of success .a person is successful when he sets the goals and works for them to achieve .once if he sets the goal , he gets organised .by talking about his gaols with some other people whom he knows he may get help like suggestions and assurance from them .in this way he achievs his goals by puting a lot of hard work in it .after achiving a goal he automaticaly shifts to new thing in order to continue his success .i mean they are ready to take risks on there further work .by doing like this they can get grip on there goals or subject on which they are working .this also makes him to get prestage in socity , he might become popular on his work .he might get money in the form of rewards and awards .successful people never forgets the steps they were followed .this makes them to stragule in new things and makes them to risk .if they work on what they already known instead of taking risks and trying for new things , they become unpopular and they forget about goals and hard work , this makes them lazy .because of this fear they always works and takes risks .
