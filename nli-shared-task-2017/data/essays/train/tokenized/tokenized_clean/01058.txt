despite the fact that each people has his own way of learning and understanding , in a general point view , i think that best results can be obtained by focusing on ideas and concepts .that does not mean , however , that facts should never be dealt with .the best way is certainly finding a compromise between the two approaches .ideas and concepts are , to my opinion , the most important part of learning , like the foundations of a building which is growing bigger and bigger .theory is the first brick you can build on .moreover , ideas and concepts tend to be universal - i think a good theory is evaluated to its degree of universalism .in a way , we could say that theory precedes the facts in that it aims at explain , and sometimes predict them .therefore learning and understanding ideas and concepts is important because it permits to think from a general point of view , without being tied by circumstancial conditions for instance .it gives students ability to adapt to a broad range of situations .on the other hand , i think it is not possible to only rely on theory .facts must be used to endorse - or refute - theories and , to my mind , theory alone is worth nothing : everyone can build theories but we should be only interested in ones that have direct links to observable facts , ones that use those facts to give more credibility to the general statements they posit .facts are essential in testing theories since they represents what has actually happened which give them strong credibility and thus they are key elements of a theory s validation .as a conlusion i would say that both are importants - ideas and concepts on one hand and facts on the other hands - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing .however , i think there could be a chronological aspect : it would probably be more effecient to work on ideas and concepts before dealing with facts .
