it is said that `` youth is the best period in life  .but few may argue saying that the older people also enjoy their life spending with their children and grandchildren and experiencing the freedom a teenager gets .however i agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do and i will explain my view in the following paragraphs .firstly , young age is the time when they have time to go out with friends and party around without any sense or fear of resposibility .they can go for trecking and can visit beaches and swim in the beach which usually a older person will not be able to do .the youngsters need not worry about their health and will not have to carry medicins wherever they go .here comes the older people who will always have to think about their health and necessary medication .also for heavy journeys which needs lot of strain they need a youngster to take care .but a youngster would love to go for long journeys with more fun and enjoyment without much pressure .i saw my grandfather who is very healthy and more funloving when he is home but he gets very much strained when he comes out with me .he is as active as i am but he doesnot have as much energy as i have though he wants to enjoy .he can watch and enjoy but he cant jump and have fun the way i do .being a young girl i think young people have more ways to have fun and enjoy life than older people .they can go for concerts , plays to have fun .but older people will get conjusted and will not be happy with the loud sounds in the theaters .we can get adjusted to any environment and get along with all friends without any place or accomodation problems .i mean we can do nightouts with friends and go for night shows which is rather difficult for the older people .young age is the precious time and have to be enjoyed to the fullest .because as we grow older we will have resposibilities which will not let us enjoy to our extremes .older people s health will not let them enjoy .so according to me young people will wnjoy life more than anybody else .
