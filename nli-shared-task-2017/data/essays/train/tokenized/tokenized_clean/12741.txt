in today s society it is nearly impossible to hide from any kind of advertisements .not only tv and radio are full of advertisements , but also the underground tube , the newspaper , the walls of buildings and almost every internet side .this makes people buy things that do not need .if they see this wounderful and extraordinary new cheese on the colourful magazine page they can not resist .but is the cheese as good as they think ?normally not .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .that is why it has become a rentable buisiness .there are not a lot of good products on the market , but everyone wants to sell his products equally if it is good or bad .so if you produce a cheese and it is the same cheese as everybody knows it over years , but the people do not buy it anymore , then you need a new advertisement .most of the products are either new , nor good .what sells them is the idea of the advertisment .another point is the customers behavior and his shopping habits .in a regularly supermarket the customer may choose between several products .if he wants to buy bread he has almost twenty breads in front of him .now there are two kinds of customers .first the ones who relate on what they knew - they will always buy the same bread .second the people who have no idea of what to take .they will have a closer look on the different products and in the end choose the bread with less fat or whatever attracted them .in this case advertising helps to take decisions .but is the bread better , because it is said so ?nobody knows .to come to a conclusion it can be said that maybe a really good product needs no advertisement and that is how you can find it .but in the modern society it will be difficult to sell something without any advertisement at all .the people are used to it and maybe they even want to belive in what it is said on the colourful magazine page .
