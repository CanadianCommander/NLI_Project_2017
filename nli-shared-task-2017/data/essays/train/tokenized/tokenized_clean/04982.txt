while there are arguments to both , according to me , i believe that people , who are succesful , tend to take risks because they often develop new products and are requested by big companies .on the other hand i have to admit that also a more passive way can lead to success .above all , statistics show that the most succesful people in business are people , who had an invention or did something that was never done before .every year a list with the richest people on earth is introduced .chiefly all people mentioned there created something new .bill gate , the inventor of the famous computer operation system windows , for instance was the first man , who created a platform , which can be used to on home computers .now he is the richest man on earth .furthermore , i believe that big companies looking for employees , who are able to invent creative methods in order to run the business successfully .if a person tries out different ways and takes calcular risks it shows a certain kind of inteligence .moreover , a person , who tried a lot of different things in life has a bigger experience .for that reason big companies might prefer someone for higher positions , who may experienced certain crises in order to prevent the company doing steps , which leads to the crises .a friend of mine was working during the boom period of the it/companies , and made a lot mony during the development of the internet .even , if his firm broke down this knowlege he had accquired during this time helped him to get another job .however , i can imagine why people might think that people although can be succesful even , if they are not risky .my father , for example , never did something else in his job : he only checked the financial bookings .he did it for almost 40 years .day by day he did the exactly the same procedures , but during the years he became so skilled doing this that it is really improved his career .he started at the bottom and was only responsible for the booking of one particual sort of products for one district .nevertheless , he made it to the top of a big eletronic company in germany .generally , i support the idea that people , who are more risky are more succesful in earning money than people , who doing what they are used to do .on the other hand , i have to admid that if you do one special jo very god you can be succesful , too .
