i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .because i believe that in the business world , the sales men always want to make money in the market , they have to make the products look more attractive than they really are .there are my reasons as bellow .first , in the competitive real world , the business man are always tring to make as much money as they could .in this manner , they have to convinced customres to buy their products .how can they achieve their goal ?they will try to over describe the function of the product as it really does .the product looks more attractive in the advertisment to persuade the customers to buy the product even they really not need it .for example , i always buy some stuff that i really do not need .why i still buy them ?because of the attractive advertisments made me believe that the products are more efficient than i can imagine .second , the business man have to make their spending and income get balanced .they spend a lot of money on advertisment , such like on the tv shows , newspapers , magazines , and even on the radio stations .if they do not over describe how the product is greater than the others , the customers would not purchase it .in addition , the sales man have to spend money to hire the designers who create the advertisments .for these two reasons , the sales man have to make more and more money to compensate the money they spent on the advertisments .to sum up , i believe that the products seem much better in the most advertisments than they really are .we usually found out what the real product is after we bought it and used it .it wastes customers  money to try it if the sales man could truely describe the poduct on advertisment .
