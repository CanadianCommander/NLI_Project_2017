young people and old people have different life styles .as far as i am concerned , young people has more methods of enjoying life than old people .in the following paragraphs , i will reasoning and provide examples to support my opinion .young people are full of energy , which means that besides their study and work , they have much more energy to have fun .young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and fun .at night , the dancing bars are full of young people .they dance , talk to each other and drink together .during the holidays , young people drive to the mountain or the sea shore for hunting , canoeing or hiking .because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work , they can not spend as much time as the young people on the holiday travels .they normally stay at home and watch the tv or chat with their old friends .young people have more new methods to enjoy the life because their brains run faster than old people .because there are a lot of pressure from the job , young people need more methods to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged .young people develop new methods everyday and then spread them all over the world .they practise new methods of entertainment and discuss them on the network .on the contrary , old people normally stick to few kinds of entertainment for a long time and do not want to try new methods .old people know how to enjoy life and they have their methods of enjoying life .but comparing with the young people , they spend less time and energy in enjoying the life .from the above discussions , it is safe to conclude that young people enjoy the life more than older people .
