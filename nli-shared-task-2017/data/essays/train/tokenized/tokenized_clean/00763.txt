in my point of view the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts is right to a certain extend .the purpose of education in my eyes is not only to teach scientific facts to students , but also to convey the concepts of the political systems and set of values of your society .in order to do so it is important that the students develop the ability to understand different ideas and concepts and get to know how to critically deal with ideas .this will help the students to understand why it is important fot them to study hard and gain more knowlege in certain areas .by understanding the purpose of their education , students feel that school it is not something which is imposed on them , but will help them to deal with educational challenges in their future life .however , the base for different ideas and concepts are usually facts .in order to understand ideas and concepts it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of facts .without these facts , students can not understand where these ideas come from or how they have been developed in the first place .however , teaching only facts can not be the aim of an education .if you teach students only facts there is a high probability that they will feel bored .it might be difficult for them to understand the reason why knowing these facts can be important for them and how these facts might help them in their future lifes .to summarize this i think there should be a balance between teaching facts and teaching ideas and concepts to students .they are both necessary to complete a good education , but i think conveying ideas and concepts should have the priority in a teaching concept .
