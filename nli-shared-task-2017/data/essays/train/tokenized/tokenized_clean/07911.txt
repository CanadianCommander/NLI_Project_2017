the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is although a little extreme , yet correct .i agree with this statement to a large extent .firstly , young people living in this world of capitalism , are very materialistic .success today is judged by the amount of money , or luxuries of life that a person has , and the young people are greatly influenced by this fact .young people work towards getting glamourous and high profile jobs .they concentrate mostly on personal gains and do not give enough time for community activities .secondly , some young people are influenced by the violence and crime depicted in films and on television .a lot of crimes nowadays are committed by young people .these young people are unemployed and have a tendency to commit illegal acts for money .some young people are influenced by radical ideologies and join anti-social , and terrorist outfits .some might argue that young people do help their communities by helping and working for non-governmental organisations such as the p.e.t.a , old age homes and orphanages .yet others might cite that some young people are involved in developmental activities for their communities and as such , are not absolutely materialistic .these facts are true and factual , yet in my opinion , there are not enough young people involved in the noble and social activities stated above to fully support and generalise the claim .finally , a lot of surveys conducted by various agencies clearly show that the young people prefer money , social status , sex , glamour and a strong education a lot more than they prefer helping their communities .some young people do have a desire to help their communities , but do not take the step towards realisation of this desire due to a lack of time and commitment .to sum , most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .some help their communities , but in my opinion the majority do not help and this is the reason why i feel that the statement , although a little extreme , is still correct .
