imagine the earth has nearly 7 billion inhabitants .almost 60 percent live in asia , which is a growing market for the car industry .yes , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .according to the market in asia let us assume that almost every citizien has a car down in asia .the car industry is going to be as happy as they were never before .for instance they are going to raise their annual income to a never forseen hight .which is good for the economy of the whole world .because the rate of unemployment is going down enornormously .and every person who is working for the car industry will benefit from that boom .firstly the employers live more savely because they are going to have more money to spend for luxury .but what is more the surrounding economy like the travel branche or the apparel industry is growing too .these are just two examples i like to indicate .on the other hand all these cars are going to cause havoc to the environment .most importantly to the air because the cars producing a lot of chemical stuff like co2 which will harm the atmosphere .according to the atmosphere which is our weather kitchen .it produces rain , snow and even oxygen , without these elements we are not able to live .to put it in a nut shell even if it rains the rain is not free of chemical combinations .so the rain causes harm to the forests and animals and yes even to the whole mankind .unfortunenatly none of our well payed scientists have discoverd a system to prevent acid rain , which is the main problem to the environment in which we live .so it is our task to save the nature for our fellowers .to ensure this task is going to be succesful we have to put more money into education .let me sum it up , more cars of course , but not with more danger to the environment and mankind .let us build even more environment friendly cars , like hydrogen cars or with solar power .than there will be no harm the the atmosphere and everthing is okay for our future genarations
