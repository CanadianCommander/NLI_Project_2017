i agree with this statement .today s life it so annoying and stressing , we must give some changes to our daily rutine , we ca nt be of only thought , today we live on a multicultural world in wich we must rescue something of each culture .with this statement i do not mean to be a musulman or a catholic , but i mean to respect diversity .we live for our work , for our job and our bussiness , i belive it s alright to test new things , new feelings , and maybe be happy with them .i ll use myself for this example .i am a studen of odonthology in a recognized university in chile , my mission is to fulfill what my parents and me want , this is . ..finishing my career as soon as possible .it s my goal too , but to my goal i add many more activities .for example i like sports , i love sports , i m a basketballer , and a soccer player too , besides tracking running in school .i know i passed to another part okf my life but i wo nt give up sports on me .it s an emotion that fills me when i m on the court , specially on the zone .i just love it .i think i am a sucsessful man .risks perssue me , because i have few time to study , my university is quite difficult , and sports for me now . ..could be a bad choice .the big problem , or the great disscusion is that i love sports , and i m not able to leave them apart from my life .and this essay s awnser is quite simple , i belive we have to fight for the things we want , that sometimes we have to be ambicious and work as twice as we are doing now , because 10 years later i do nt want to regret that i took the wrong desition .i m not willing to make that error , i m choosing both my career and my passion , sports .
