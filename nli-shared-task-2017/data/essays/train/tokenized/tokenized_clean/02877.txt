i agree with the statement that young people nowadys do not work hard to help their communities .i think they spend their time doing other unimportant and useless things such as playing games and killing time .they also make the community worse in sum cases such as playing loud music in the middle of the night when everybody is trying to have a good night s sleep .they act agaisnt the society s interests and add to the noise pollution .there are several reasons that contribute to such behaviour of youngsters .these include peer pressure , stress thorugh family problems , child abuse and so on .friends may think thst it s ` cool  to smoke , drink and do drugs .they think that breaking rules is the way to gain fame and popularity among other members of the same age group .troubled childhood may add to such behaviour too .some youngsters may be facing a lot of pressure from family members or through child abuse .this may lead them to remove their frustrations on their communities by troubling them and disturbing them by breaking the rules .they may go terribly out of control and rebel arnd the age of 12-20 years .youngsters may not be willing to help their communities because they might think that it is boring and montonous to help out their communities .also to fit in to the ` group  , their behaviour pattern changes which makes them less co-operative .they try to distract and destroy their community by playing horrible loud music , blowing horn for no particular reason in the middle of the night while having fun with friends .they may throw litter unneccesarily across the area and spoil the environment .they may destroy habitats of certain species and cause them to become extinct .the society can try and bring about a change in todays youngsters through love and guidance .older people can try and make freinds with the youngsters .this can be done by frequently holding a community meeting .for example , every month a community conference can be held specially for teenagers explainig to them the consequences of not handling their community in a proper way .drastic action can also be taken such as by complainig to the police should teenagers behave in an ill - mannered way .parents can treat them strictly for improper behaviour .
