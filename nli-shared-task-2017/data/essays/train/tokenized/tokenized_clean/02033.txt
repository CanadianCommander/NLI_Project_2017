did one ever asked themself the question how the world would like in twenty years ?i guess everyone did .i am asked to write an essay about the following statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .today it is the year of 2006 .twenty years from now would be 2026 .popular thoughts against cars are that they are not good for our enviroment ( ozon ) so that it would be much better for the nature if the people would use trains .as well as the argument that if one takes the train one will not have to mess with traffic .those ideas might contribute to the statement that there are going to be fewer cars in use than there are today .in my opinion i do not think that there are going to be less cars in use .a car is a really nice way to get from point a to point b. one is not dependent on the bus or the train .it is nice to have the opportunity to use public transportation but one also has to rely on them .most of the time the bus does not drive when one wants to be at a certain place .for example , if a student wants to be at school at 8.00 a.m. but the bus only arrives there either at 8.05 or at 7.35 , he will have to be 5 minutes late or wait for half an hour .having a car is much more convenient for that matter .i am sure that people will not stop driving cars because of them harming the ozon .people destroy nature all the time .people already know about the problem and do not do anything about it so they will not stop driving all the sudden because of that matter .if one takes a closer look at the argument that traffic might people hold back from using cars , one can see that a train or bus has its places where they need to stop and their certain routes .by taking a bus one might even waste more time than being stuck in traffic .it always depends on where on lives though .i would recommend taking the train in large city like nyc .but taking the car outside of the city .i came to the conclusion that one needs to differenciate between the city and the suburbs/country .i think that in twenty years from now cars will be used fewer in the cities but in the suburbs just as much as today .
