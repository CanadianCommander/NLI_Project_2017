i have been working at a fast food chain for two years .because i have the most experience with the job than most workers , i train many of the trainee .as i taught , i made them learn the concept of making the product than to learn the facts .one day , when i was on my break , an angry customer came to the store .he explained that the trainee gave him a drink with milk powder , when the customer was allergic to milk .the trainee made an excuse that she did not know what the powder was made from .then , i noticed the importance of facts rather than the ideas and concepts .learning ideas and concepts may be a great place to start the education , but facts are also very important for a student .for example , a curious student may be working on a experiment using acid .the teacher may tell him the concept that the acid in the experiment is dangerous .but , since the student is so curious , that he may try poring some acid on his finger , to see what happens when you get an acid burn .soon , he would be suffering from major chemical burn , and be taken to the hospital .as it is said in `` pandora s box  , we are born to be curious .once we learn the ideas and the concepts , we must satisfy our pleasure by learning the facts .i can not say that ideas and concepts are not important ; we need them to learn .but just stopping at the concepts is not enough .we must proceed , and get better understanding by learning the fact .ever since the incident with the customer , i learned a lesson to teach my trainees the facts including with the product .now that i think about it , who would train the trainee the facts if i did nt share my knowledge now ?
