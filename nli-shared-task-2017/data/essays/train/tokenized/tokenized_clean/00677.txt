i agree with the statement ` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .also , young people do not have to give time to help their communities .nowadays , people are busy to live .they have to work for their family and themselves .it is hard to earn a living .people do not have enough time for themselves .how can they help others ?if they have enough time and money for their communities , it is okay to help others .however , if they do not have time and money for their communities , there is no way to help others .human beings are born selfish .they first think about themselves , their family and their friends , not the people who are not related to them .when there is enough time and money for them and for others , they may help others .but helping thier communities is their choice .it is not people s duty .however , some people think it is our duty to help others and help our communities .it sounds good , but it is hard to do .for example , a person who has little income which barely afford his or her family take time to help the communitiy .it would be good for the community , but the person s family will not eat their meals .helping their communities can be possible by the people who can afford their family first .helping their communities is not bad .it is good behavior , and also it is for all people , not only for one or two .but to help their communities , the first thing to do is help themselves and their family .helping their communities from the heart can be done just when thier family is happy .to help from the heart ,, people should take care of themselves and their family first .
