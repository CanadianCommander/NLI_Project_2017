there are so many subjects which entices our concerning during study in university .it is not a matter you re bachelor or master or doctor .the real essentical of academic subject , knowledge itself , is interesting and attracting for human .but , i do nt agree with the assetion that we must boraden our knowledge better than specialize in on specific subjec .i will give you a two reasons .first , there is no such easy academic subject which can conquer in one or two decade .almost every academic subject needs one s whole life s efforts .most important thing to become a intellecture is concenturation in one specific subject not become a know-everything man .actually , human can not kwow whole things of the world .for example , there is a person who i know .he studies philosophy and he also eager to know lot of things about the non-philosophical things .it is not a bad attutude i think .but , he did nt get the degree in year what he plans to get that because of that eager distracted his concenturation .second , the society wants the person who has knowledge which is specialized in one specific subject .if he knows lot of other knowledge , of course it is a good things .but it is not a primary but secondary .people who are talent in one specific subject can works as proffessional .but the person who know many things but not specialized is not a proffessional .for example , there was two friends of mine .the one of them was talented in many things .he was a good singer and good dancer .he also studed well but not the best .when he became a adult , he get a job .but it was not a specialized job .the another friends was talented in only school study .but when he became adult , he got a job in a specialized area and he got a lot of salery .to sum up , very essential respect of academic knowledge does nt allow multi-studying .because the ability of human is so limited , we must concentrate in one study .and the society need proffesional person not a know-everthing man .
