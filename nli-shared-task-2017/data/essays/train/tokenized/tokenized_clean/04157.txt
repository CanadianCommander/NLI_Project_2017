i agree to the opinion that it is more imoortant for students to understand ideas and concept than ot os for them to learn facts .understand in the ideas and concepts are the base to know the facts more deeply .for instance , if a history professor teach the facts of the art in ancient egypt like people made pyramids and buried king s mummy in the tomb which walls were painted with narative story .it is difficult to understand why ancient egyptians made pyramids and burried king s mammy , and the walls inside the room are painted with narative drawings .if the processor give students the concept and ideas of why they made pyramids and burried king s mummy in there , it is more fun to learn the facts .for instance , the pyramids are used as king s tomb , and it was the symbol of power at that time .inside of the pyramids are constructed to protect the king s tomb .the narative paintings on the wall are painted about the life of the king and god they worshipped which is for amusment for the king s life after the death .if the student understand the concepts and ideas , they will understand deeply .also , it is easy to make them interested in the topic because they know the basic information ( ideas and concepts ) of the fact .in addition , they can learn facts independently because they know the concepts of the facts like how it is made or what it is for .understanding concepts and ideas give students various ways to learn the facts , and they can have own opinions about te topic .therefore , it is better to forcus on understanding concepts and ideas that learning only facts .
