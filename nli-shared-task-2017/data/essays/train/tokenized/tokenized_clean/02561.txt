when youth of the past decades are compared with the current young people , a dramatic result appears , which is that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays .in order make this comparison , we have to examine how it was in the past , and how it is now .most of the nations have young heros in their histories .to give an example from turkey , consider ataturk .he was very young , when he joined the army .he was about 20 years old , when he decided to do something in order to increase the overall living standards of his own community .ataturk is only a single example from the thousands of the young people of that time , who fight to death or thought about solutions to the problems , which their communities are facing .it is very clear from the historical events that youth of that time had serious concens about their communities .when we examine the young people of today , we come up with a whole different picture .again to give an example from turkey , i can say that there only a few young people who are concerned with the current problems in their community .we see that , our young people can kill someone else because of a soccer team , or a girl .other than that dating with someone is more important than the hunger of the community for most of the young people of the current time .it is very frustrating to admit that we are rather living in our own worlds , as individuals , rather than living in the real world as communities .eventually , it is very easy to say that the young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .they are not concerned with the problems of the society and they do not tend to do anything even the community faces a serious threat .
