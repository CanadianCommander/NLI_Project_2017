travelling in a group led by a tour guide can have disadvanntages and advantages .i prefer travelling without a tour guide or even without a group .what i like about travelling alone is that you can make every decision very spontaniously .you can choose where to go next and what to visit each day depanding on the weather , your mood or your finances .in comparisons to travelling with a tour guide , which contains a very rigid schedule without any leeway , travelling alone is preferable if the target of your trip is pleasure more than obtaining as much information and facts as possible .a different perspecitve is travelling with a tour guide provides you with detailed information about cultures and history that only experts can deliver .and you do not have to invest as much time to plan out your whole trip .the trip has already beplanned by the tour guide .this can cease in a deeper insight with less effort .on the other hand travelling independently could open opportunities that tour guides can not offer .for example , two summers ago i traveled to spain fore two weeks .in those two weeks i learned more about cultuer than every expert could have brought to me .i got to know a local girl my age and we became good friend .she invited me to her families house for dinner and even to a wedding of her sister .i gained a deep understanding of the intrinsic cultural differences as well as differences in every day life .a neagtive point of travelling independently is that it involves more effort .i you want for example not to stay in one specific town , it needs a lot of encouragement and knowledge to find out bus schedules and upcoming fees .and at the end the trip might not even be worth it since you do not know what to expect and where to go .
