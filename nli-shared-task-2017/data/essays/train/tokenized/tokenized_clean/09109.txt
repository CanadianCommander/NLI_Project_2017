i would totally agree that most advertisements make items appear much attractive than they really are .the most impartant reason is that marketing makes use of or subconcious feelings and desires .another reason is that products show just convenient aspects of a product rather than a natural mix of disadvatages and advandateges .first of all the success of a product is determined bz its advertisement .initially the product is just a product , an object which has many similar competitors .but when the marketing section begins the product develops to a subject which incorporates a specific feeling or soul .let me explain this examplatorily .when for instance nike tries to sell some new shoes thez are firstlz nothing than shoes .and what makes them different from other shoes ?and how are people able to distinguish them from others ?the companz which advertises the product tries to arouse a awareness of a specific group in society like e.g. young basketball players .the advertiser try to give their product a soul or feeling which automatically rises in a person who sees this product in the media .thus the adveertisers attemp to render their customers an opportunity for identification with theri product .in this case we can imagine a young boz sitting in front of his tv and watching this new ad and feeling the same as the people in the ad feel .so , it is possible that whenever he gets this feeling he rememebers those nike shoes he saw last time on tv .based on this example i would saz that product sellers make to a certain extant use of the feelings and thoughts of their customers .the customers watch these kind of ads and absorb the message behind it unconsciously , which can lead them to buy a product without knowing why .i think that this depicts that we are somehow controled by the ads and the media .and this is really scaring me that i m unconciously doing things i would nt do under normal circumstances .another example which shows that ads make products seem better than they are , is the successful marketing of alcohol and cigarettes .we all know that these products are heyardous to our health and can cause death but especially young people are capable of being seduced by these kinds of ads .the do nt show the inconveniences of smoking like its smell or unsociability but more important is that thez do nt show the hayardous effects this item could ahve on our health .besides the inscription on the cigarette packets there is no information given about impacts .in mz oppnion ads just trick customers to buz products which are worse than thez seem .
