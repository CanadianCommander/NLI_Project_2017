i do nt absolutely agree with the statement .i study at university since i was 19 years old and in these three years i ve understood how has been important to have choosen one specific subject to study .usually the most important universities offer a lot of courses : each one belongs to a specific subject .for instance , i study `` transport and logistics engineering  , that is a particular aspect of the world of engineering .this does nt mean that i do nt study the basic subjects of engineering ( as mathematic analysis , phisics , statystics etc . ): i study these subjects the same , but perhaps i study only their basic aspects .if i had to study all the aspects of all the subjects , i think i would nt have the time to do anything else , because it would require me too much time .consider that now i study 8 hours a day at university and 6 hours a day at home .moreover i spend 2 hours to go to university from home : how could i find the time to study every particular aspect of every subject ?i think i would become mad ! .so , i think that knowing a lot of things is beautiful , but at the end it is impossible .this is also because the university try to prepare students for the job they will do in the future .this job usually belongs to one or few subjects studied at university .so why do i have to study more and more subjects ?i talk you about my experience .the aim of my course is to prepare students to solve transport and logistics problems within a few time .this is very important for us , because in this way we avoid to study some subject and instead we can concentrate on the most important ones , in other words the most `` operative  ones , that comprehend the knowledge that actually we must have when we ll do our job .for all these reasons , i confirm that i completely disagree with the statement .
