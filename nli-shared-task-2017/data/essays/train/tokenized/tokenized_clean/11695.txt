in the past in each scholl or university there was not specific subject , but the students had a knowledge of many subjects .today the number of course at university are increase because they would people specialized in one specific subject .in my opinion is better to have , in the first year of study , broad knowledge of generic materials , than specialized in one specific subject .in this method students are increasing their culture in their material very rapidly with very strenght ideas .another point of this system , are that could incresing new post of work and new type of work .to complete my opinion , i agree to spend part of study for stage , it is more important because it is between study and work .in summary today students can specialised in one specific subject , but the world of work remain too far , during this specialisation .
