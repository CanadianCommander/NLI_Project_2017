in the last few years technology is updating itself rapidly .to follow the new invents become very difficult nowadays .especially one of the main problem which we have in our lives is transportation .the scientists are trying lots of things to help all the world people about this problem .can you imagine what will happen10 years later ?if technological investmesments go on rapidly and scientists work so hard , it is not a different evnet to become having fewer cars in twenty years .first of all , let us look at the devolopment which have done in the last 10 years .ten years ago , it was not thought that everyone would have mobile telephones and comminucate to each other without any cable .perhaps the people who heart that had a smile on their faces because that is not posible for them to have anything like this .when it comes to fewer car event , this is not impossible in this view .the other thing which we must consider is the way of technology about transportatin .although many wide any confortable roads are done , there is still no solution for this problem .but in last years , the number of travellers increasing faster than before .so , investmens will be much more on air transportatin .as we see in cartoons , this can be possible , too .on conclusion , we can say that , because of unexpected fast devolopment about technology , the use of cars will probably decrease and instead of that the air transportation , it will probably be choosen by many people .if you see some flying cars on the air a feew years ago , do not be afraid .that day probably is this day .
