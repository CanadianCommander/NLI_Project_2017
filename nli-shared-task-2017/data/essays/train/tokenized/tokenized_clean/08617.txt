in the modern society , many things have change comparing to the past .the korean trdition for hleping other have dissapered but instead we developed a new way of helping our communities .so i disagree with the opinion .there are three reasons why i dissagree with the opinion .first , the traditional way of helping others have changed into various types .for example if you dial a certian number you can donate small amount of money or there was this event i went .it s the program to feel the starvation , uncomfortable house and all the pain that the children in the third world countries are giong through .i donated some money and starve for 24hour .by doing this i help a child to eat three month of nutritious meal .so even though i did not visit a orphanage and did the cleanings and reading children stories i helped my community .second , the student have nowadays have to serve their community at least 20hours to go to high school or university .many people say that the true meaning of helping other is what comes out from your heart not the grades .but because of this system i learn the joyful feeling of helping others .after than i did more of the helping community more than the school required and i stared to get involved in many charity groups and jion unicef .third , because of christianity , many students donate their money when they go to church and participate in activies to help the other in their community .for example , my friend goes to church every weekend to give food for the homeless in park .it is not only christianity that encourage helping others many kinds of realigion encourage students to serve the community .just because some traditions has chage it does nt mean that the young people do not give enough time to help the others .so because of these three reasons i disagree with the opinion .
