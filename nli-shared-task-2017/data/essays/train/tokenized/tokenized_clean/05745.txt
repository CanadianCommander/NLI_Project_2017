i completly disagree with this statment .i truly belive life can be enjoyed by a person of any age .first of all i belive that just like their are allways different views of life their are also different ways of enjoying life .for example for a kid , a life full of joy may be deffined bye the abillity to run and play .for a teenager joy may be in the art of being in love or taking risks and learning .then again an elder may expirience the same ammount of joy than a young person just bye laying down on a hamac on a sunny afternoon to remember beutifull times , or to read his favorite novel .for example if i was an elder i would love to recall my past expiriences whith woman and tell them to my grandsons .and the stories of grandma and i to my grandoughter .and then again as i am young their is the beuty of learning and expiriencing what i will later tell my grandchildren .their is a time for everything and in these times you may enjoy life in manny different ways .
