i am agree with the point that the it important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the factthe main resion behind of is that if a student want to be last long good students then in that case he/she will has to learn the basic things behind , which will still with his for whole life and when ever in the life he will be needing it will be just recalled by him .only those people can perform well in the platform of the life who was a good student in the past .what i think is that only knowing the fact is creating the shortcut to learn the things , ya it helps sometimes but not always that why it is very much nessary to learn the things by the understanding the ideas and the conceots .in future what will happen that if a student was not a good student in the early stages then in that case he would be also not a good teacher , i.e. he can not explain or transfer the fact to the others .and to support my openion i am taking my own example - when i was a student in the college ( engineering college ) then in that case my favourite topic was the explosive and rock type ( mining engineering topic ) .so , i took that topic with very much interest and the result is now i am getting today when i joined a company then it was a co-incident that i was putted in the drilling & blasting department and on the 14th day i had managed by owm a blast in that perticular mine .and very soon i got the authorisation of the blasting in that mines in the 6th month , which is record for that mine , which only my personal openion .so , here all credit will automatically go to those classes where i was provided the idea and the concept of the thing .so , i am thankful to my proffesor who tought me so well , and i would like to pray with the god to provide the professor of that kind to other students also .so , students should pay attention in the class .
