as we all know , creative people succeed in our society .i agree on the statement ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .basically there are two reasons ; for new inventive ways , and another chance of getting failure .firstly , you can have better solutions if you try new things .if you recall all the inventions in this world , those were invented through the attempts to try the things in another new way .successful people also try new things to have new inventions of their own .since the creativity is the key to the succeed in these days , the chance you can be successful is up to your creativity , which means , trying new things with probable risks .secondly , you can have the failures to learn from them .even if you had failed in the attempt for a new way , you are still gaining something from it : the evaluation skills .you can evaluated the process yourself and find the new other ways that will not repeat the same mistake .and if you succeed , you can have another new way of your own , which you know so well since you invented it .for conclusion , i think if you want to be successful , you should be creative enough to undertake the risks that can be follow your creativity , because in that way , you can have your own solutions to be successful , and that you can learn from the failure if you had failed .
