i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from today .the question at hand is highly controversial as many people believe otherwise due to various reasons such as increasing pollution and fuel costs .however , i still believe that the number of cars on road will increase .going by statistics , there is no sign to show that car sales is decreasing .every year , more and more number of cars are being sold across the globe .the rapid rise of several coountries such as india and china will only increase the car markets for the manufacturer , leading to higher production .thus , there is no indication whatsoever to believe that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .also , due to the generally risng standards of people , and the car manufacturers desiging and manufacturing cheaper and more efficient cars give rise to the speculation that as more and more people are able to aford a car , they will go ahead and purchase one .one another major reason for this the rapid increase in the number of roadways avaliable in the world .more and more number of countries have now started building broader and smoother highways .thus , improved infrastucture is not only an indicator of the trend that more people are going to invest in cars , it is also an incentive .many people might feel that due to the increasing awareness about the negetive effect of cars on air pollution and the rising oil prices , the number of cars may decrease in the coming years .however , most of the companies have already taken a note of these factors , and working their way around these problems rapidly .hybrid cars had already hit the road a long time back .cars are also being developed which run on alternative fuels , such as edible oil and cng ( compressed natural gas ) .these new innovations will make sure that the enviornmental pollution is kept under check and at the same time , the cars become less dependent on oil .in fact , various research institutes across the globe are trying to harness the solar energy to drive modern cars !given the present trends , and the efforts made by research institutes and car manufacturers , i believe that number of cars on roads will only increase as the years pass by .
