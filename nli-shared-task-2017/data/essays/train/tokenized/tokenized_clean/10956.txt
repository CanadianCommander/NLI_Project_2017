i agree with the statement young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .young people of this modern world do not care about the communities around them and being a human being it is our prime responsibility to help the communities .as man is a social animal he tries to live in a society and mingle with the rules in a society .the young people nowadays have changed a lot due to the freedom given to them and independence to do any thing they wish to do , the young people are least bothered about their communities .instead of helping the communities when they are free they go out and have parties with friends .the young people are given the financial freedom by their parents to such an extent that they even never bother about their parents as well as communities either .moreover all the youngsters are not alike , some people are busy in their studies and jobs and they do not have much time even in spending with their family and also with their communities either .so they will be unable to give enough time for their communities .the young people nowadays do not try to take any responsibilities which they think are not necessary .the young people more often think that it is not necessary for them to help their communities and go out and enjoy with their friends when ever they have some free time .nowadays the young people are interested more in refreshments they are required from their daily routine work and get relieved from their responsibilities instead of helping their communities .in contrast some of the young people inspite of their busy schedule find some time to help the communities and they fell that helping their communities brings a change in their routine work .this is the case of few people who still fell their moral responsibility of helping , where as most of the young people nowadays fell no responsibility about their communities .some of the young people are only concerned with their job and their family and nothing else .so young people must soma have find time to help their communities .
