there are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better , but others prefer to travel single instead of tour guide leading .but i would have to say , if i was faced with this issue , i would probably follow the tour guide s leading in a group .in the following discussion , i would like to reason and provide examples to support my viewpoint .no issue is more important now than the one that refers to safety .history witnesses and presents many examples , that travelling by oneself may meet some dangers or troubles .for example , we go to a less level country , such as china , and take money on hand , this behavors may suffer some dangers .or when we travel an eurpeon country with unpolited dressing .do nt you think the examples quoted above are very persuasive ?convenience is another head and chief reason that i have chosen to put it here .it is no better illustration that can demostrate the view .if the trip is not convenience , it will take the travellers too many energy to enjor their trips .even familier as a couples .they will be unconvenient on a busily trip .superior as leading by a tour guide , leading by tour guide or deciding trip by self also has own demerits , too .deciding trip course may spends many time and may lose something interesting .leading by a tour guide may lose one s freedom to find something else beside the tour .nevertheless , the advantages of leading by a tour guide carry more weight than that of the disadvantage of leading by a tour guide .so the most striking conclusion is obvious .to sum up , given the reasons discussed above , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive , we can safely to reach the conclusion taht leading by a tour guide in a trip is more safe and convenience .in fact , not only do i prefer to travel leading by a tour guide in a group , but also prefer to hire a personal tour guide for one s own tour guide to serve himself as well as possible .
