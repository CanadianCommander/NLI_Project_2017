i completely agree with the statement .it is clear that everyone s life is full of obstacles and problems and often we re not be able to prevent them by accurate projects or by putting ourselves in certain conditions .owing to this fact , people who experiment many difficulties in their lives and can get over them , even not easily , are more prepared when any other obstacle occurs .in addition , who have the luck to try in his own life a broad variety of experiences have surely a more flexible mind that can help him solving problems or getting higher places in the society .for example , a man who has tried different jobs and has learned many different skills , would surely learn and do faster a new work than another worker who just applies for it and who never experienced other jobs .so , people who like adventure , new experiences and thing they ve never do before will most probably gain much more skills and ways to get over problems than other people ever could do .since those are the most required characteristics in all activities of the society , those people have great chances to get succes in their lives .even the attitude to take risks is a fundamental characteristic to be successful , because if you never try other thing , you will surely stay on your current state of life and you ll never have the opportunity t get higher .moreover , take risks teaches you to accept both winning and losing , that is the most important lesson one should learn in order to achieve any kind of objective .on the other hand , people may have good reasons to not take risks and to not experience new things , such as family , studies an other thing that may be much important that have a successful life .
