the issue of whether we should travel in a group or alone has been widly debated spcially after the events that happened around the world .some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .other people like to travel alone and without a tour gide .both approaches have advantages and disadvatages .although , tour guide gives more and easy information about the places , socities , people , and the history of the country that we visite , i would rather traviling alone and without tour guide .some people may argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .it is more easy to descover ; so this argument goes , the places and avoide any trubles .however , traveling is an enjoment that icloudes discovering new things and knowing different people and get in touch with different culturals .therefore , if i travel in a group led by a tour guide , i will be controlled by the guide s directions and i wolud not be able to act and get in touch with others by my own way .moreover , travel alone or with a good friend not with a group that i do not know provides me with a uniqe experience .for example , three years ago i traveled to the united arab emirates with my best friend , jack , .eventhough non of us use to live or being there before , we had a very good time and experience .we rent a care from abu dhabi , the capital city , and we almost went every where in the country just by using the mabs and asking people in streets .in conclussion , i believe that traveling alone and without been attached to any group gives the most wonderful experience in the life .
