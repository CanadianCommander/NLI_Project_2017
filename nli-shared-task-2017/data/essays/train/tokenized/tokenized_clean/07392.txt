supposedly , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .the truth is that both having a broad knowledge about a cornocopia of subjects and specializing in one subject are very important factors to being successful in whatever a person does in his life .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help you along in the future .it will help to develop yourself as a person like it will also create many interesting conversations in life .for example , if a student is spacializing in art when he is asked a question about modern tecniques , it will be important for that student to know about historical events , not only in the art world but also what was going on in the country he or she is speaking of .it will be vital for that student to understand the politics of that time , the hardships of the people , and many other contributing factors that are involved in the development of the tecnique in question .another example to why knowing about different subjects is important is to make yourself more educated and impress people when you speak because they get an image of you as a person that is not ignorant .specializing in one subject is also a vital factor in life because it is easyer to find a job when one has speciallized in one subject .people still need specialists to work on their equipment and to run their companies .for example , if your computer breaks down you will not ask someone who knows about computers but doesnt know how to fix it to reppair it for you , you will ask a specialist , someone that knows alot about computers because that is his strong point and he can fix it for you .but nothing sais that you cant be a specialist and have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects .in conclusion , both factors ( having a broad knowledge about many subjects or specializing in one subject ) are vital to having success in life .both will help you mature and decrease your ignorance level and both will increase your wisdom and your educational level .
