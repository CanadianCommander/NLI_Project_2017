the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  contains a lot of aspects which can be analysed .first of all , i do not agree fully with the statement given .these are some predictions of what may happen in the future with our everyday transport :in twenty years  time technology will have advanced importantly .nowadays , the population in becoming aware of the earth s environmental problems .a great amount of the society recycles , and does not waste energy .many scientists are investigating new ways to save energy .and cars and transports in general are one of the most polluting producers .is there a non polluting substitute for them ?today , many investigators are looking for an alternative to cars that will not destroy the earth .there are already some cars that work with petrol substitutes , but they are not very popular .if we found a way to preserve the environment without not using our cars , there would not be fewer cars in the future , but safetier for the planet .some examples of non polluting transports are becoming popular in many parts of the world , like bycicles .many people , mostly persons who live alone or without children , take their bycicles to go to work or the city .but this alternative can not be accepted by everybody as there not everyone lives alone or in the city .in my opinion , the only way the number of cars will decrease in the future is with new technological inventions .maybe in twenty years time we will all travel around by private planes , or by flying skates . ..who knows ?it all depends on our future inventors and their imagination to create an easier and less polluting way to travel .
