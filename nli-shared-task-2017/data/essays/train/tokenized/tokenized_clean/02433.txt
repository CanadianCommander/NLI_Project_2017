i think it is very possible to be decreased the number of cars or vehicles in the very near future .nowadays , number of the cars increases especially in big cities day by day .our lives become harder and harder while this number increasing .people spend their hours on roads just to be able to get to their offices or schools .tranportation can easily be a chaos .on the other hand energy resources are limited to supply energy for the unlimited number of cars .excessive number of cars also causes air pollution which is a big problem .scientist are also trying to develop alternative ways for supplying energy such as cars run with solar energy .but energy supply will remain an important problem as long as new cars are produced .dozens of new cars enter to traffic each day .but this can not be unlimited .even for today , people have begun to find effective ways of transportation .these alternative ways can be public transportation , subway or motorcycle .according to my observations most of the people prefer public transportation instead of using their own cars .i think people will have to stop using cars in the future even if they do nt prefer .because natural conditions wo nt let them pollute the environment so much .maybe , it will be too late for taking this decision .there is no resource in the world that we can use unlimitedly .with the rapid improvements on technology , some genius solutions can be found .maybe , we wo nt need cars in the future and return our nature .
