for what concerns my point of view , nowadays advertisment is used to convince people buying products that are often of lower quality than they seem on the tv spots or on the advertising spaces .i think most of the companies are only interested in earning as much money as possible .their policies don-t always care about ethic and moral principles .this attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their products .they want to caught the eye of the consumers with bright colors , wanderful images of idyllic places , beautiful women , music and similar things .they work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desires and the dreams that their target customer has .but on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the goods .i think every customer at least once experienced the misleading informations advertising conveys .when i was a little child i always want my parents to buy things i saw in the television spots .for instance , when i was six i was amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with children .i thought that she was able to answer every question i may ask to her .but when i went to the toys shop and i tryed it i was really sad in understanding her abilities were only crying and saying she was hungry , thirsty and sleepy .now i-m no more a child but often products that attracts me with advertising don-t satisfy me at all .i think that governments should be more severe with companies , checking if the standard of goods really meet the promises of the spots .the companies can-t be free of telling lies to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .
