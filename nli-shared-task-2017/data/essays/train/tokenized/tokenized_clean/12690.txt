i support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i would like to support this with the following observations from my personal experiences .with the advent of technology , a greater number of means are available for young people to enjoy life .when i was kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in india .now kids at young age have different options such as video games which i never had an access to .this translates to the older people too , who would have no access to these gadgets .even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these devices .in the era of consumerism more and more products are offered for the young generation because they control the spending .companies that tailor their offerings to the old people are between far and few .i feel this also has to do with the age .as people grow they become more mature , their interests change and they also tend be more appreciative of the needs of the family members .as a result they curb their activities and go into their own shell .last but not the least , with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailments that take off their most time .they have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activities which they would have done in their younger years .having said that young people enjoy life more , i would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all .but as discussed above the means change as the time passes and they start limiting their activities .
