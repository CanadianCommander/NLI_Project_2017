i agree with the statement , i think that for the students is more important understand ideas and concepts , because when a person understand ideas ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept .but i think also that for understand better ideas or concepts a person must learn facts , bacause facts rappresent a great example about ideas .at school students study a lot , for example , history because this subject is very important for understand a lot of today things from the past mistake .if you know the human history you can do the best choise , but a lot of students stady the history but sometime they ca nt understand the real meaning of things that they have just read on the book .for this reason , for me , it is very important learn ideas , because not all people can interpretate in the right way the facts .it is much faster study a fact then understend correctly concepts .the real problem about this learning metod is that there is nt a single way to interpretate facts , all people have a different mind and not always they give the right sense to things .a professor can interpretate in wrong way a fact and tell to his students wrong things .
