i have always believed that all advertisements make products seem more efficient than they really are .according to my own experience and to other people s stories , i can tell that there are some relatively huge exagerations and ornamented descriptions .one of the points that i totally disagree with is when they show us two different situations or images .in the first one , there is something to be done and it has to be the use of the adverised product .in the second , they show a different picture with a perfect result , which is not realistic .in fact , it s just a simulation that does nt garantee in any way such a result .i remember once , my brother saw the commercial on tv about the best selling product to treat acne .they made everyone believe the stories told by some different people who , acording to them used the product and had amazing results in a limited number of days .what proves that the person who had the face covered with acne before and who has a perfect skin looking now , had used the product ?on the other hand , it s obvious that the seller s purpose from this advertisement is to persuade people and encourage them to purchase the product .thereof they make it sound nice and matching the client s needs .it is also clear that competition is among the major reasons that pushes the seller to make the public compare their products to their competitors  .this leads most of the time to an over-description of the item .for instance , many commercials show us the efficiency of detergents by washing the same dirty clothes using the advertised product and another detergent of a different or unknown brand .then , they show us the result , with a distinct difference .after seeing the advertisements , i have personally bought a car that was supposed to be gas-efficient , a cream to eliminate acne and pills to lose weight .however , there is some truthiness missing .i do nt exclude the efficiency of all the advertised products , yet most of them are to a different extent over-rated .
