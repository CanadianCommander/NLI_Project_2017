in my opinion the statement is partially true .i think the success of a person depends on several factors , not only on the capacity to to take risks .for example a really lucky man does nt need to take any risk for accomplish what he is doing .i know a guy who just won the lottery , he is a clearly `` successful man  , or at least he got more success then me , infact now he is having fun on his big boat , and i m writing an assay to pass the toefl test to be accepted for an internship in the other part of the world , and i will work for free .thus , according to the socrates  theory , the point is to define the definition of `` successful people  , and i think there is nt any general definition of `` successful people  , i think a successful guy is the one who improve the world .according such definition one who wants to belong to the `` successful people  group should he have to follow the way he can afford best .if he improve the wrold he belongs to the `` successful people  group .to acheive that point he can both employs new things and take risks or just reuse what he already know .the goals explain the way used to acheive them .all the people are differents , so one can acheive the goal to improve the heart in one way , anotherone can acheive the goal in a different way .the important thing is to make the world better .a way could be let me passing the toefl .
