i agree with the statement .i ofen thought that why most advertisements take a lie in my childhood .i have two reasons about it .first , i have the experience which i was baught the kind of hobby by soch most advertisements .i get the game machine .when i often watched on tv , i watched many advertisements together .it make me buy many things .so , when i discover the game machine , i thought it had good perfermances .i ask my mother to buy it to me .my mother said it is too expensive to buy now , and she buy it for 1 year .after then , i could get it ten months later .i am very happy , but this machine is bad , so i was angry .then my mother angry me too because it is hard to her to get this machine , and she think i am happy to get it .secend , it make bad relationship for many people with such first reason .many people expect good goods which is watched on tv .when it is not good or bad goods , most people feel stress .it reflect to other person , and many people feel bad .in conclusion , it is sometimes needed because of incresing products , but inalmost stuations , it is not needed .
