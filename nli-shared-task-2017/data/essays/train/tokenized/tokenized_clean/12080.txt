although its an ambitious and challeging motive to have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects , i would rather prefer to have knowledge about one perticular subject .there are few reasons for which i feel this way .firstly , a knowledge all subjects means a lot of information and plenty of hardwork and time for gaining the information .as a result of this complex interactions of the above factors , most of time adequate knowledge of any of the subjects is not aquired .as a result of this a person becomes a jack of all trades but master of none .secondly , lots of sujects mean lot of hardwork , and there would be too little time for personal life , which means he will have less time for making new friends , watching movies and partying .after all education is only one part of the curricilum , there are many other activities to be done to make an all round personality .as a result of this his social life might be affected , and he will fit into the classic old saying , all work and no play makes jack a dull boy !!finally , at the end of his education period if he feels that there is no looking back for him , since he has aquired all the knowledge , he is then dumped again .once in professional life , people prefer those who are specialists in a perticular subject rather than those who have only a moderate knowlege of it .for example a person with high blood pressure and respiratory difficulties would go to a cardiologist , than to go to a general physician or a family doctor .he will feel that he would get a more precise treatment under a cardiologist s help .in conclusion , eventhough just think to aquire all the knowledge in the world sounds good , it is practical to have complete knowledge about one aspect .
