the issue in hand is about the ideas and concept understaing or facts learing .this issue is improtant because it can diectly affect the result of what the student learns .i believe that the understandinf of the ideas and concepts is the better opinion since it can make it easlier for students to learn .the first reason that i choose understanding of the ideas nad concepts because it is the easiler way of memory .unike remebering the facts , the uderstanding of the ideas and concepts is a lot easlier to transfer into long term memory .thus , it is able for student to remeber much longer .base on the easlier way of memory , i believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion than the other .the stable foundation of the studies is the second reason that i choosse the understanding of ideas and concepts .a deep understanding of the idea and concepts is similar to a building which has a stable foundation .only and only if the foundation of the building is strong enough , it is able to build up higher and higher .since the stable foundation of the studies , the understanding of ideas and concpets is better choice .finally , the abilities of flexible use make me choose the understanding of the ideas and concepts rather than the other .the remebering the facts is just a remembering , it will not allow to create something new .however , unlike the remembering facts , a deep understanding of ideas and concepts not only allows the students to create something new , but also provide the abilities to use it in any area .thus , i belieive that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion .in conclusion , i believe that the understanding of the ideas and concepts is a better opinion rather than the other .it is because of the easlier way of memory , the stable foundation of the studies and the abilities of flexible use .
