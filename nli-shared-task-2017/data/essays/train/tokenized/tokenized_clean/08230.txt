i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .just learning facts might be too boring for students and they might lose their interest in the subject .one reason why i believe that , is that understanding a bigger meaning or cohesion of something may enhance the students interest in the subject .to get the context of an issue is far more interesting than learning facts and not knowing their meaning in a bigger picture .furthermore , students might develop more independence when learning concepts rather than on facts .a scond reason why i believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , is that students tend to forget dry facts quite fast , because they can not relate them to something sensefull .if they however , understand a whole concept , they might know why it is important and they might be able to connect that concept to the real world and aplly it .in that case , the students will know what for they are learning in school .another reason , why i believe that ideas and conepts are more important for students to learn than facts , is that in general facts are difficicult to apply in the real world , because they are just part of a concept or an idea .understanding just a part of something does often make not much sense and is useless .understading something in a whole , makes student be more interested in more concepts and ideas , because one idea may lead to another , and so on .to sum up , i believe that facts should be the base that is to be learnt in order to understand big contexts .just learning facts does not prepare the students for the real world , since the real world does not consist of facts , but of ideas and concepts .
