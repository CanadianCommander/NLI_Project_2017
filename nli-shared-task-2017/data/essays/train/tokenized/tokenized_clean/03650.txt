it is debatable whether young people give enough time to helping their communities these days .some people say that young people are dedicated to help the poor live vividly giving lots of donations and sharing difficulties with the difficult in our society .however , i disagree with the idea that young ages are pouring their time into sharing difficulties and helping their neighborhoods because they are likely to concentrate on their private things such as enjoying their lives , earning a money , and studying some subjects .in addition , the traditional culture in our society such as sharing our foods and adversity is likely to disappear very quickly nowadays .first of all , young generation has a hard time to find free time .they are very busy and they put their all energies to their private sectors .for instance , my brother who works for hanyang hospital in korea as a doctor concentrated on his job .even when i invited him to my housewarming party , he did nt participated in the party because he had bulks of schedues such as surgery operations , meeting his professor , and studying for some exams .not only he can not help their communities but he is also unable to find free time for our family .second , i believe that the atmosphere in our society is changed recently due to rapid development and strong competition like survival game in movies , which might make young generations disinterested in other s problems .especially , young generation did nt experience the hungry eras from 1950 to 1970 when some our people were starved to death .so , they did nt know the issues of the poor who are now starving and do nt pay their tuitions .some people say that in our traditional society , our ancestors firmly believe that the first priority in our life is virtue , especailly helping our neighbors live happily and overcome their difficulties , however , nowadays most people tend to be not careful about other s difficulties .i agree with that idea and our educational ministry should try to make effort to announce the importance of helping the poor for our young generation .in conclusion , i think that young people should put their more time into helping our communities financially and emotionally .
