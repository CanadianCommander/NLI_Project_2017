personally i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enought time ti helping their communities .i have mainly three reasons .my reasons are points of support , economics , and security .one mainly reason is support of communities .in general , all people belong to their communities .community support the people with tangible and intangible .for example , tangible support is fire resuque .if happened to fire , the people of neiborhood in community support you .second example is intangible support .if disappeared activities in the communities , it is not vivid .communities support you with spirits .second mainly reason is economics .communities depend on the economics of their communities .for example , if fully to take money with communities out resouces , the economics of the comunities is not surplus .where is necesary of money ?it is taxations .the economics of the comunities without taxation is effectively and efficentally .the commitment of young people is good effects of the economics of their communities .final my reason is security .the netwok in the community is good points of security .security is not free .in general , common services is free rider problem of macro economics .if young people commit their communities , the cost is lower .therefore , i do not support that young people recently do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think that young people have to help their communities for own profits .
