i definetely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it s the way to sell products for few times .first of all , for making good products , companies need to have expensive and good materials or things .doesnt matter what kind of product it is , they do nt want to spend a lot of money on their products .because they want to earn more and everbody knows that the best way to sell a product is advertising it .advertisements show these products like they are great .obviously they lie to people .but companies does nt know that its not a good idea to do that .maybe for few times they will earn money more than they expected .however later on , these products lose their popularity .because people understand that this products are not good as they hope .people absolutely know what is good for them .so that company will fall down as fast as it grew up !it will lose all its money , probably more than it earned from the first time .i think the best way producing products are making it as good as company can .after this , they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way .i beleive that people must against these kind of products , because we spend our money on lies and nobody gives it back to us .maybe if we should against this products that they arent good as adversisements show to us , maybe our grandchildrens wo nt see this kind of lies and bad products .if we against them and not to buy this kind of companies products , they will be gone .after that actually we can trust the people .we dont have to think twice before we buy something .the most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people .if you lie to someone , even though you will say truth next time , they wont beleive you .the main point is not to think only ourselves .everybody has to care about other people or even animals too .if do something wrong or not right , one day someone can do it back to us .we never forget this .
