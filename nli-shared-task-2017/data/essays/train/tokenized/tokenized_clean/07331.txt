although many people think that there is nothing to worry while there is a guide .he would be responsible for all the needs they want .i personally disagree with the assertion that to go with a tour guide is the best way to travel .first of all , traveling with a group could waste much time waiting for other person .and it is very unconvenient to go trevel with a lot of people , especially they are all strangers to me .there will be several rules that you should follow .it is not romance and happy at all .second , the tour guide often wants to have a aboundant impression that all the people in the group .the plcaes are arranged too much ; in the end , there always no enough time to spend on each place the group been .i could not remember or experence the environments where i only spend five minutes to stay with .i need more time and enjoy the difference between where i live .last but not least , i have heard more than one time that people have the same impression about the same country they have been .it is because the guide always take people to the same place .for example , it is the same that the pictures of my friends and my parents which they took at frence , only the faces are different .however , i want something more than all the people s experiences .to see the real things happening in the foreign coutries is more attracted than the photos on the post cards .in conclusion , it is not interesting at all if i can not decide where i want to go .the most interesting part of traveling is to study the country and decide where to go , and it would be better if there are some things unexpected happened .going with a group is definately mot one of my choice .
