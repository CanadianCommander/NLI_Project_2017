a lot of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because thay think that they always have a full timetable .i totally disagree with this statement for two reasons .first of all , most young people do not help their communities , because they want to avoid the dirty tesk .for example , there is a park near my house .when i was a child , my friend and i always went to the park to pick up the litters after school .but nowadays most young people thinks that kind of tesk should belong the pedastrian servents .secondly , most young people spend a lot of time playing the computer games and watching television , so they say that thay do not have time .but in the past .when young people did not have such a variety of recreations , the young people usually did a lot of community services .for example , my mother has gone to the hospital near her house to be a volunteer for nearly thirty years .thus , the excuse that the young people say that they do not have time is just an another excuse of unwilling .some people may disagree with my pionts , claiming that the young people indeed have other things to pursue , like the job competition , the pressure of school work .however , i still consider that the young people can squeeze a little time to help their communities .
