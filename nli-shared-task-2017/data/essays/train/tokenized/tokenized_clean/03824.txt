the issue at hand is whether the young people enjoy life more than the older people .i think that young people can surely enjoy more than the older people do .this is mainly due to couple of reasons .firstly , the age factor serves as a major consideration when it comes to this topic .obviously , young people are far more energetic and healthier than the old people .this is purely due to the old age that the older people attain which in turn makes their body and mind slower in all activities .this proves that the young people can enjoy more than the older people due to the high energy levels and good health conditions .secondly , young people have more interest in life to enjoy than the older people .young people tend to come up with new ideas for enjoying life and like to have utmost fun .they are more open minded that the older people .for example , most young people would also like to adventure and involve them in lot of trecking activities .whereas the old people might not have the interest and energy to involve in adventures .thus , young people can enjoy more than the older people as they are open to new ideas to discover life and have fun .finally , in most cases , money plays an important role for enjoyment , young people tend to enjoy the most with their money .moreover , these days even young people are paid high salaries where they are able to lead a luxurious life at a very young age .eventhough , the older peope may have lots of money compared to the younger people , they might not be willing to spend as they already know the value of money .also , due to the reason that they know how hard it is to earn that money .on the otherhand , the younger people can spend more to enjoy as they might have just starting earning and have less responsibilities .i ultimately feel that younger people enjoy life more than the older people .i believe this because young people have less responsibilities , less hinderences , more energy and more interest to enjoy life .
