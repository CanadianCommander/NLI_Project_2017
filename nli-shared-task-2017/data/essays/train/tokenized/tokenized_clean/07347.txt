i generally agree with the statement .i want to stress that in my opinion succesful people is nt people that earn a lot of money or that is only on the show business .obviously most of sucessful people reach a better quality of life and it is generally well considered by others .let me state that two well known and sucessfull man are bill gates and einstein .the first is among the richest man in the world , the second i suppo was nt so poor , but whom of the two did something usefull for all of us ?mr. gates leaded us to a standardization that makes save a lot of time and the second enlarged our vision of the universe .did they take any risk ?i suppose that mr. gates spent a lot of time in his garage taking the risk to waste his money .the same for einstein that tooked the risk to be joked by collegues and to abandon his career .as a further more and quite obvious example : if primitive humans did nt approach to the fire probabily i was nt using this computer now to write .i agree with the statement because persons i consider among the sucessful people are those whom do something that can be useful for others , and generally this cause what generally is called success .about to take risks rather than doing things in the well and old fashioned way it s really true that from a stationary situation nothing new can comes out .for shure risks have to be evaluated in advance and an assesment of the real and current situation should be performed ; we are discussing around succesful people and not around crazy or mad people .
