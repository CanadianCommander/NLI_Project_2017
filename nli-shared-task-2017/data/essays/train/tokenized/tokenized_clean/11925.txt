the main idea of traveling is to enjoy and to know a different environment .take pictures , spend some time enjoying new places or walking around are some of the activities people do during a trip .these activities require time and going with a little group of friends who have the same tastes or just alone is the best idea to totally enjoy and take advantage of each minute .choosing a place to go is a difficult decision .there are a lot of choises where to go during vacations and if a person chooses a place it is because he wants to take the best advantage possible of that trip .two or more people who share the same tastes are more likely to have fun in the same ways , a group of advetured friends or a couple of lovers can be some examples of it .in a guided trip people will be forced to see the places given by the agency so there will be no chance to change plans .during a trip people like to spend the money in souvenirs or gifts .going without a tour guide will safe a big amount of money because people can look different ways of transport , restaurants or hotels .these money that they will safe can be more wisely used in new places or just gifts .in a vacation trip people want to have more privacy and time to spend with their families and friends .a moment enjoying the sunshine in a new place is reason enough for changing plans at last minute .in a guided tour this is just not posible , the prepared schedule ca nt be change because that will disturb the other people who want to continue with the trip that they already paid for .as a conclusion , the best way to plan a trip is with a group of known people without a guide .that , will help the trip to have more surprising moments and to safe some money that can be use for other different purposes .the explanation above can explain that i desagree with the statement : `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide
