the car industry has long been a central issue for most western countries  economy , and constitutes even some of the most powerful and influent firms such as general motors .the case being such , the future twenty-year tendancy , apart for being of a critical importance for such firms , should be a good clue for the industry and economy evolution .some long term tendancies support the increase thesis .the cars are becoming cheaper everyday ; and driving is becoming easier : thanks to technology cars are more safe et easier to drive , and the motorway web is developing and improving almost everywhere .cars have became unspareable nowadays , even apart from the deep countryside prejudice showing that poor lost farmer who can not have his daughter s medicine delivered in time without a car .for the companies cars and trucks is the fastest and most flexible way to make employees and materials move , and being the best way to do it , it as became unspareable .but some other tendancies leads to the opposite .today is the first time in 30 years that the car production is decreasing .moreover , in some of the major cities cars have been forbidden or submitted to a tax in the city center , such as in london .in most of the major western cities , such as paris , cars have become much more slower than public transportation .and the increasing of public transportation is another heavy tendancy .of course the dramatically increasing oil price would probably enhance these tendancies .however , and concidering these antagonists points , cars would certainly not disapear , but probably decrease in number .these considerations were mainly theoric and concerning western countries .from a more technical point of view of just basically counting the cars and giving interpretation , there are two facts : in western countries we have reached a peak and then should be decreasing from now ; in china and in india the car number will simply explode before twenty years .and two billion people buying a car have more effect that 300 million americans not buying a third car .even if several complex tendancies will compete in western countries , and probably end up as a decrease , these evolutions will be nothing compared to the thirld world cars  consumption which is very likely to explode in the next few years .
