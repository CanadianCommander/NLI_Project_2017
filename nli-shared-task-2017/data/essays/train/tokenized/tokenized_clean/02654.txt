do you know that 82 % of the young people nowdays do not share and help their communities .this belongs to many reasons : they do not have a time for that , they have some dreams and projects that they want to do , and they must have a time for themselves to have fun or have a rest .first , young people specially the students do not have atime for this works .they have homeworks to do and quis to prepare .also they must work to earn some cash that will help themto live .second , they have some dreams that they must work for it or project that they trying to finish it .in addision , they must have their own time to have fun or visit friends or joining parties with family , specially on the weekends , the only time that they can help community on them .in conclude , take note that most of the teenagers prefer to have their time alone with out sharing it with any else .most of them do not prefer to help others and i think this up to them .surly helping people specially the who needs to help is a good thing but i am sure that there is many blocks that well not help them to do this great porpoese .
