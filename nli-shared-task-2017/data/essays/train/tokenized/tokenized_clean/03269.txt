the need for understanding ideas , concepts and learning fact of the topic is necessary for a student .the concepts and ideas in a genetic engineering class will help the student to solve the unknow problems or analysing the results of observation during a research in human evolutation .therefore , without understanding concepts a technical education ca nt be completed .whereas , learning facts about the same topic is also important but without concepts it ca nt be applied to a subject .learning fact are essential during history class .so , both understanding concepts and learning facts are very important to a student .as i am a technical student , i would need to understand the concepts of my subject prior to the facts already present .therefore , i completely agree with the statement that understanding of ideas and concepts are more important for a student as compared to learning facts .the doubt between knowing concepts or facts can be cleared from the history of science .earlier , scientist who discovered new things never knew any facts about it , they just understood ideas and concept behind an incident before introducing their theories .for example , observing an apple fall from a tree and understanding the theory of gravity .many of the scientist belived in concepts rather than facts .facts can be important in learning history , arts and many be sometimes sciences like engineering and medical .but the importance of the concepts and ideas is manadatory for development of mankind .when we consider science behind the growth of world , we ca nt forget the importance of concept and ideas which lead to the sciences of particular kind .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is important for a student than learning facts .for the science and technology to grow exponentialy , we need through concepts of subjects and understanding of ideas behind it .computers , wireless technologies , fighter planes , new medicines are the fruit of excellent concepts and innovative ideas of the researchers only .
