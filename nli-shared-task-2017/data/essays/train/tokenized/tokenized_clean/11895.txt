now days , the spanish young people has another mentality .i know a lot of people with my same age that they have time to helping the communities .but also , i know a lot of friends that certenly they do not has any time to help .why ?because they has to study a lot and also they has to work to pay his house .in one hand , the young people have a lot of fun and everybody knows that we can reduce that time .and that time we can dedicate to helping their communities .and in the other hand , a lot of people directly they do not think about this topics .i think that side is made a very bad person .for example , always when one of those , expreses his ideas the people of other countries tend to archieve all in the same box .so , i think that it is a very polemic statement .i think this is not goging to change with a statement .we have to remote to the roofs of the people , and there change the mentality .also , the primary education needs to change in this type of child formation .if you teach a kids that there exist more important things in the life than the money , the studys , or the work .i think that the next generation they will grow in this aspect .and the people will be more happy with thw others .
