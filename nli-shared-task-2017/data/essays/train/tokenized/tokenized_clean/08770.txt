do the elderly enjoy life as the young do ?from a psychological standpoint , it can ben claimed that the way people perceive the world changes as they get older .in other words , they get more realistic as years pass .thus , i am inclined to believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .to start with , younger people expect more from life , and , to a great extent , people believe in the possibility of realizing their dreams in younger ages .as a resut , this inner drive makes people to enjoy the life in all means , since they feel that they still have time to do what they want to do .however , as they get older , they start to think that they will never be able to be the person that they have dreamt of .secondly , younger people have the energy that is needed to enjoy the life .that is to say , they do not have to worry about their health situation while thinking about an activity .for example , it is almost impossible for older people to attend activities that need more energy and attention such as surfing , rafting , and skiing .on the other hand , some people claim that older peple enjoy life more than young people do , since they have more time than the young .in other words , they do not have to worry about anything else apart from making themselves feeling better , and enjoying the life .however , this argument can be considered as right only for a small percentage of the elderly , since they are not even able to find someone to accompany them for most of the time .taking these points into consideration , obviously , young people have more opportunity , and chance to enjoy life when compared to the old .however , i strongly believe that this situation can be improved in the future for the advantage of the elderly .
