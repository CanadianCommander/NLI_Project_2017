either from news articles of a magazine or stories told by close friends and relatives , you ll get many chances to hear about travels .in fact , travel is a common topic in conversation and an important part of our experiences .but , if you actually think about persuing a trip to a place you ve never been before , you ll have to make a crucial decision on the method of traveling : travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a tour guide .but , considering the many pleasures you ll miss by choosing a travel led by a tour guide , the former method can not be the best way of travel .people , who support the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide , maintains that this method can reduce mistakes and accidents involved in confronting a new culture and place .for example , if you travel to thailand and touch a person in the head by your left hand , you ll find a irate person without really knowing the reason .of course , travel with a tour guide will prevent these mistakes .but , as mistakes lead to better understanding of a different culture and make the travel itself more memorable , mistakes itself constitute a valuable part of your travel .people supporting travel with a tour guide is overlooking this essential part of travel .there are also disadvantages involved in travel in a group led by a tour guide itself .first , this kind of traveling leaves you with no opportunities to meet local people .as a great traveler and novelist in korea once pointed out , three essential elements of travel are nature , food , and people .by traveling with a tour guide , you have to follow the rules in the group and are always busy following the group s schedules .this leaves you no time to have a nice conversation with the local people and no chance to make a friend .this shows that travel with a tour guide is lacking one the essential elements of traveling .second , travel led by a tour guide leaves no room for you to obtain a better understanding of the region .of course , traveling in a group led by a tour guide will lead you to see the monuments that represent that region in a more efficient way .if you travel rome , the capital of italy , in this way , you will be very impressed with the old monuments such as the colosseum and will want to visit again .but , you will miss the golden opportunity to see the various streets of rome and better understand the current situation of italy , which would ve led to a better understanding of the culture of italy .in conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide prevents you from meeting the people of the local region and gaining a better understanding of the local culture .even mistakes made by travelling without a guide will enrich your travelling experience and make it more memorable .hence , the argument that the best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guide can not be justified .
