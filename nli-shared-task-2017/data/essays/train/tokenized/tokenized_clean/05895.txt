i completely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .i have three strong reasons to support my opinion .demand of cars are huge .it is spread worldwide and no one can now believe life exist without cars .in america , i experienced we definitely need cars to live especially in rural religion .to go to the supermarket , to meet my friends , to go to school even , we need cars to bring us .it is impossible to walk to the station , if it is placed far from one s house .i do not think that this situation and demand will change in twenty years , which is too early .in my country , japan , car industry is really huge to support out economy .japanese are commonly said to be good at making electorical product including cars .japanese companies extend not only inside of japan , but also worldwide .toyota , matsuda and mitsubishi are companies producing great deal cars all over the world .if there are no need to produce present numbers of cars , these companies will be in serious problem with bussiness function of my country .as a way to maintain present economy , japanese government will cooperate with companies .so that people continue to buy cars for long while .nowadays , i saw a great news on the television screen .it said that some american invented a new electorical car , which run faster than jaguar and produce no gas at all .it is actually a big deal now , however , because of this big news , other companies has got a neccesity of inventing one of these cars .i think in a few years , it will enable to public to see electorical cars in a city and ride on them .this is great opportunity for people to get along with environment of the earth .thus i think cars numbers of cars will not decrease , but car will function in other meaning .i believe
