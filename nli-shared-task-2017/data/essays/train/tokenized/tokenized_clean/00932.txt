the traffic , the huge amount of cars in the ways or streets and the problem of road travel is being discussed for many years .it is wanted to be solved and to solve this many solutions are developed .i do nt think this problem will be solved in twnety years and i do nt think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are two reasons why i think like this .first reason i think the manufacturing never stops .i mean the manufacturing of the vehicles such as cars buses which carry people one place to another and occupy the roads .the firms produce many many vehicles every year and there is an absence of the rules about the older cars .furthermore , older cars can be the main problem about traffic .the newer ones fill the roads every year , every months and even every day .in contrast , the solution is being thought that underways , undersea travel , metros , railways and sea travel may be considered to reduce the traffic jam and so do the number of cars in use .but i do nt think it is enough .secondly , people usually choose their own vehicles to travel beacuse of many reasons , for example they may want more comfortable travel by their own vehicles and moreover it may be cheaper than the others .besides , the trains , for instance , carry many many passanger in a day , however these many people can disturb each other when they are in the train .therefore , there may be little decrease in the number of the cars .to sum up , there are two reaons i mentioned above that it ca nt be possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years with todays technology .besides , the firms have to produce more and more cars to exist and the people will always like comfort and their own cars .on the contrary ; may be flying cars can change my mind if it is possible to manufactured .
