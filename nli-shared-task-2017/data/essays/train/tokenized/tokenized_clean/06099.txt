with the development of the human society , the amount of knowledge exploses .knowledge is power , but i do nt think one single person could handle too much of the power .i think that one should specialize in one specific subject , rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .it is not necessary to have broad knowledge .in the lifetime , it will be very very lucky do have one great contribution to a specific subject .many people are remembered by us just because they did a very good job in their specific subject .for example , nash , who majors in mathematic .he masters nothing but to calculate in papers and thinking about his math problems .even worse , he got nearly mad for 20 years of his life during which he could not work as a normal person .but he is well-known and remembered by us just for his contribution to the math .beside , human s energy and time is limited .one can not spend his or her time on too many fields , especially when he or she lives at today the time the amount of knowledge exploses .in contrary , if somebody tries to study extreamly well in many fields , he will feel exausted but still can not handle them .moreover , to study in many subjects may leads to a very bad result that he can not study well in any of the subjects .however , i must confess that it is good the have broad knowledge if you could .knowledge in one field sometimes affects that in another field .there are indeed some people succeeded in many academic subjects .the question is they are the minority and it is not realistic to expect many people could be like them .so i think it is better , and what s more , more realistic to specialize in one subject .
