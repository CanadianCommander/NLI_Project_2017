in daily life there are a lot of products and some of this are not so good , but most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are !yes , i am agree with this statement because i think that a person have to touch with his hands the product he need becase if we follow only the advertisements he can fall in a not good product .for example , if i have to buy something products the first thing is watch this prodict and analyze it because i want to know it is good or not .is like buy a t-shirt of a famouse stilist or a not famouse stilist , all the people prefer the first one because have the name but when they buy it , they do not look the material ( for example ) , they buy it because is made from a famous stilist .but if we research more and more in another store i think that we can find a better t-shirt with a low cost .another example is a dishes soap that i call with the name ` a  , the advertisement say that a can clean everithing and your dishes will be white like the best white thing .than a person go to buy it because the advertisement say that a do miracles , and when he wash his dishes , he observe that what the advertisement says is not true !than , in summary i want to say that is important to think befor to do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy , because sometime we can take a products that most advertisements make much better than thy really are and everytime this is a tipical thing for to spend a lot of money for a products that is not good .the first thing to do is think and the second is choosing the best product for its quality and for its cost .
