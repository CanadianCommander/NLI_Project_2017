before giving a straight answer to this question , i need to state that it depends on what the specific person intends to use his academic education for .in my opinion a solid basic knowledge of a variety of subjects should be obligatory to everyone , who seeks an academic degree .but as this should be content of the school education and somehow a foundation for the decision , which subject is choosen at university , the goal to be perfect in everything is not a useful and not a realistic one .to understand the last aspect , one should regard that the knowledge in the world is doubling every four years and speed of this process is even increasing .an all-around genious , like da vinci or other great characters in the renaissance , do nt fit in our time .this means not that i do nt see the importance to link knowledge or to have a broader horizon to deal with academic problems .nevertheless i prefer to get an education that gives me the chance to specialize in my field of studies and go as deep into the topic as possible .the main reason for this position is the fact that most of the students , including me , will once enter the market for well educated and highly motivated working force .to get an advantage in this competition is essential .and it wo nt make me special and important for a potential employer that i know a bit about biology and art-history working as an accountant in car industry .to have a realistic or even good chance in this field of industry i d rather rely on my abilities in business administration and knowledge about this kind of industry .therefore it is , in my eyes , important to make an early and specific decision , what you want to achieve in your academic studies and - if possible - where you want to work in the future .the same is relevant for students , who are occupied with for example law .most of the students i know , who made a degree in law , needed to focus on one specific sector of this field of studies .otherwise they would have had serious problem to get an appropriate job .because , the rest of the students with no vision end as taxi
