in most cases academic education provides the possibility of a profound and distinct understanding of a certain subject in germany .as a basis you have to take several subjects in the beginning and this leads after approximately a year to specialization into one subject .a broader knowledge of more academic subjects could have some advantages regarding more flexible and way different approaches to solve a problem .however , this leads to a lack of specific details on evaluating complex problems .one might argue that with a greater diversity of subjects there will be more solutions and the person can go into detail if it is required .but this often requires a lot of time and usually companies are not willing to invest more money and additional time on educating their employees .hence , specilization if choosen in a smart way can give the applicant for example a significant advantage .on the other hand it has to be ensured that cultural understanding and logical thinking trained by mathematical education has been provided .therefore the schools host students in germany for 12 to 13 years are responsible .education needs a lot of time implying that a further unspecialized subjects are being tought at the universities it even takes longer for a student to be prepared of working autonomously .according to the benefit of the society and a person which accomplishes its studies in a shorter amount of time the conclusion i m drawing is to ensure broad knowledge in schools and in the first year of university but then quickly turn into specific subjects .this does nt mean to limit everyone to only one subject .especially in science there are lots of examples where fields overlap and knowledge of both subjects is the key to interact but it just takes too much time and resources to educate e.g. a scientist in literature and music art and vice versa .eventually everyone should be able to choose whatever he or she wants to study and know where their strenghts lie .
