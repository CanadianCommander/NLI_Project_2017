cars are one of the modern transportations nowadays , which are commonly used by everyone .cars can make our lives easier by saving our time and energy .as cars are getting more and more commonly used , the energy needed for the cars is getting lesser and lesser .as in result , energy crisis occurs , and which becomes one of the most important daily issues to us .i believe in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because of the scarcity of energy , and the innovation of technology .it is obvious that there are more and more cars on the streets nowadays .but has anyone awares the huge lost of energy ?probably not .cars will not work without gasolines .as more and more gasoline is purchased , it becomes more scarced .in economics view , when a good or service is getting scarced , the price of the individual good or service will increase .that is what s happening to the gasolines nowadays .as the price of gasoline rises , the living expense also increases .in the end , people will not use cars as common as we do now .and this is because of the scarcity of energy needed for the cars .when the situation of scarcity of the the energy is happening , people tend to find many ways to solve this problem .the innovation of transportation might be the solution to this problem .scientists who work on energy developement might create new energy instead of the traditional energy , gasoline .with the help of these scientists , the solution will either be having new forms of energy , or new forms of cars that consume less gasoline .therefore , traditional cars will no longer be used in twenty years .in conclusion , the scarcity of energy and the innovation of technology can reduce the number of cars in the next twenty years .scarcity of energy leads to the rise of living expense , which will finally force people not to use cars as much as they do now .the innovation of technology will help developing new forms of energy that will not be used by cars , and new tools of transportation other than cars .therefore , i believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the next twenty years .
