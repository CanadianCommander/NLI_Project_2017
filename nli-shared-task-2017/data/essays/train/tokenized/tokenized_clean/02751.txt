technology progress has changed the world physically but also , and above all , mentally .whereas in the past helping their community was a priority for young people , i think that this trend is progressively disappearing and that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .because the progress has made that people are not `` forced  to live together anymore , because the world they now live in is more individual , and eventually because the new world they live in does not fit with trhe conception of a community .in a non so distant past , people used to spend most of their lives where they were born .indeed , good transportation systems were not yet developped and it was a lot more difficult than today for young people to move from their home .then people really lived together a good part of their lives and i think they were by consequence closer to the others than today .emotional and physical links between people were stronger and this led naturally young people to give time to the community .nowadays nothing ` forces  young people to really belong to a community , they can move easily thanks to technological progress and do not need the others to simply live .i think that is why they do not develop and feel this notion of community and then do not dedicate enough time to it .moreover , this development of technologies contributes to create a more individual world in which all that could bring a community is available : knowledge , entertainment , etc . ..everything is possible alone and then young people do not need anymore the help of a community .for instance , they can play games on the computer alone , whereas before the only way to distract was to play with the other children of the community .this makes that they will less focus on the community .and finally , the world young people live in today , is a world tending to make confused the notion of community .now young people have contact with any part of the world they want , people are not separated anymore , are not `` stuck  anymore into communities , they can discover other communities and this opening of the mind maybe leads to make looser the attachment to a community .the world in which young people live in today is more complex , individual , and open on the rest of the world .those three factors contribute to the `` loss of interest  fro ; younf
