as the whole world is confronted to pollution , some decisions and reglementations have to be made to avoid the environmemtal destruction .cars are very concerned by these new measures and they are bound to be fewer in twenty years .first , the trend , in most cities is to develop buses and subways to encourage people to use it instead of using their own car .it has two advantages : the reduction of pollution and traffic .moreover , sometimes , when the pollution reach a certain level , the circulation of cars is forbiden .if the pollution continue to increase , in twenty years , cars will not be allowed to enter cities .cars will disapear .some cities have begun to take big measures .london for example rules the circulation in the center of the town .people have to let their cars in the suburbs aroud the city and to take the bus .it can be surprising but it could be the case of many cities in about twenty years .however , it still remaims a problem with trucks , we can not ask the buses to deliver the goods .maybe , we can find a solution with new energies .experts say they can produce oil with vegetables but not for the entire planet .what about focusing on trucks ?besides , most of the car s companies try to adapt their cars to environmemtal reglementations because they know they are threatened .some try to reduce the pollution produced by cars , other to make them function with electricity .i think people have to get used to a new way to travel .by buses in the cities , by train to go from one city to another , by plane to travel abroad , by boat to cross the oceans , etc .everything follow this trend : transports are more and more developped and less expensive .look at the buses : they can bring you everywhereto conclude i do not expect a great futur for cars .behaviours are starting to change : people travel a lot more by train than they used to .
