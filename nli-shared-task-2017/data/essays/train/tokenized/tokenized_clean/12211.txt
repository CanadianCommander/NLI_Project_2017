there can be many opinion in this topic that twenty years later cars will be fewer than today .actually the oil and gas will be gone in 21c .however i disagree with this statement .because car is developing very fast and in some years we can needed just 1liter of oil to go 30km .moreover before the oil and gas gone scientist will make new car that go by electricity or by sun light .first , car is developing extemly fast .before 10years normal car can go 5or 6km by 1liter of oil , however now car can go 18km by just 1liter of oil .and now car is developing very fast that , we can not imagine .for example , their was a car that , go 5km per 1liter of oil .and in the future car will go 30km per 1liter of oil .than oil needed 1/6 than the past .however scientist calculated that only 40years left to use all of oil and gas .however when car develop like this , the time will be spent 120 years to use all of oil and gas .and of course you will change your car when you use 15 ~ 20years .than it means after 20years there will be a plenty of cars by development of cars .second , scientist will develop and make the cars that do not need any oil and gas .like electronic cars or sun light powered cars .now vents the car company is developing the electronic cars and sun light powered cars .and vents company will make that cars in 20years .that means in 20years people do not need oil and gas cars anymore .for example , the oil and gas price rises up , like 3times than now .after that oil price rises up car company made electronic and sun light powered car .than what do you prefer to buy ?new car or oil and gas powered cars .many people will buy the new powered cars .than there can be a plenty of cars on the streets like now days .in my opinion i think there will be plenty of cars after 20years .because car will be develop very fast and scientist will make electronic car or sunlight powered cars .and this will makes people to ride cars after 20years
