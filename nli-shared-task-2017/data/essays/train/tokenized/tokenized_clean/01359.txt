i agree with the statement with `` young people enjoy there life more than older people do  .when life is like a game and we ever dont know that will happen any time with our game .so i think it was best place to enjoy the life at some good young stage .enjoying the life can be of many forms .but it should be make some attention in the career growth too .for example a young kid can enjoy his profession which intern makes sucess for this career .enjoying the life with some carrer oriented allways a good option .i enjoy my current profession software engineer very much and i likes to keep every thing honest without any misleads .this is the way i feel myself happy .there are many examples like the people enjoy there work and becoming very great people .small example i can give is google websearch creators , they enjoyed there profession very much and started developing a very great product this intern leaded to the employment to many people aroung the world .young people enjoy there life and also should set some examples what is the proper meaning of the `` enjoying the life  .this is not only releated to the area of science this can be releated to the areas of music , arts , soical etc .youngsters are backbone of any country development and growth .but the enjoying the life should not turn in bad habbits example like drugs , sex etc .seting example to the others is allways are great feeling for any young kid .there are many greater stories happening in the recent time about many young kids how do they enjoy the life and sets examples .finally i feel we has to enjoy the life with fun and passion and face the problems straight and set examples to the others
