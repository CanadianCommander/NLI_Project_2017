it is early in the morning .sun shines showing us its beautiful , radiant bright .birds sing in melifluous sounds .but somewhere in this village , you hear constantly yawning sounds of students in a class .the teacher is filling the blackboard with stringent face .the words which are filled with balck board is all about the history of ` the hundred year war  over france and us .students fall asleep subtly .that was a brief description of a class in korea .i was born in korea , and raised in korea , and educated in kroea .and now , in 2006 , i am here in united states of america as sixteen years girl to experience american education which i ve heard that is extremely different from the education that i ve used to have .the first class i had in american high school was biology .it was `` literally  different .i was shocked in pleasure .the new learning about biology was a fresh catharsis for me .i learnedabout the system of the cell .actually , i ve learned about it in korea too .but the difference between that same concept is this ; my korean teacher taught me the `` fact  and my american teacher taught me and helped me the process of understanding ideas and concepts .she did not force me to memorize facts that i used to do in korea .instead , she had a laboratory with me , together , we made a model of cell , and then that was definetely easy to understand .furthermore , she finded the real video from the internet and then show me how it works and what its principles are .it s been several months pasted since i learned about the system of the cell , however , i still clearly remember the video she showed me and each detailed structure we ve made .no doubt i got a one hundred on that class .learning facts is short-living .it will leave your head as soon as you learn other things .you can not remember it unless you ve translated that facts into your own language and solidified to `` concepts  .it takes amount of time to pass the process of turn facts into ideas .you should find the way to clarify and figure it out .it might be burdensome .but once you ve figure it out , and you can clarify yourself that you understand the ideas , then it would be a genuine knowledge not just facts .i m so glad to have topic .actually i was a sort of suprised to face this topic which reminds me the experience this american education gave me .i ca nt wait to learn ideas and concepts and then understand it .i did nt know or experience the joy of learning when i was in korea .my eyes were always heavy and not active .but in here , the eunderstanding its genuine idea or concepts enable me to study with my volition , not by parents .
