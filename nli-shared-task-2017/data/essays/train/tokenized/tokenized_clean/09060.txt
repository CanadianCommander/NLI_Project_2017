the given statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  is a disputable topic .but i would like to disagree with the statement .this is because i believe that in twenty years from now , there will be an increase in the number of cars used as compared to what we see today .the most important factor which supports my view is the kind of advancement in technology that we have .i am sure that with developments in the above feild we will soon have better and improved versions of car models .with the growing concern in terms of environmental pollution caused by cars , we will have better fuel saving , nature friendly models which will be welcomed by all .also it will attract more an more number of people to buy such eco friendly cars .another reason why i disagree with the statement is that , i feel cars are much more convinient than other public transport facilities available .and therefore they serve as a better option for conveyance .hence , as man is more convinence oriented , in the future more and more people will be encouraged to buy cars .also , now a days people are becoming more and more aware of their status and respect in the society .and in order to match up with the norms of the society dominated by rich people , they follow what others do .so this attraction will to buy cars for themselves and therefore contribute to increase in the number .finally , i also believe that people are becoming richer day by day .the class i am discussing is upper middlecalss an d the rich people .middle class and otherwise poor people can anyways not afford such a luxury .so with more and more population having extra money will drive them into looking onto for previliges and luxury .it is very much possible that different members of the same family will own different cars for their own convenience .so to sum up , i think that newer ans improved models of cars , their convenience , their status value and extra money with the rich people will ultimately lead to a society with a greater number of cars in use in the coming years .
