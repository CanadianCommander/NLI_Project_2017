in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and i am strongly agreeing on that statement .currently the world is changing in extremly fast speed than what we expect .especially technology is the part where humans are really concentrating on and that will bring lot of influence to the future car .also environmental problem will give influence to stop making car .according to the news article , the world gasoline will run out in next 10 years .if there are nt any gasoline left in the world then the car wo nt move .currently most of the cars are moving with gasoline and it is in serious problem .lot of car companies are feeling this is serious problem , and they decided to make hybrid car .instead of making new designed-car they thought making hybrid car will be more efficient car in the future .instead of gasoline , they will use alternative energy such as crude palm oil or the sunlight .next twenty years will come really fast and probably they ca nt produce lot of hybrid cars so numbers of cars in next twenty years will be fewer than now .second lot of environmental issues had been brought by cars and that will reduce the number of cars in the future .at present , due to air pollution , the global warming is happening .the ozone layer has the huge hole due to air pollution .the main reason can be co2 which is coming out from the car .to save the world , lot of country will reduce the number of cars to stop global warming .anyway as i mentioned in above information , the car wo nt go because there wo nt be any gasolines left so cars which is running with gas will goto junk yards or developed into other tool machines .with two above evidences , in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .due to cars which are running with gasolines are causing lot of problem to the world and that will reduce the number of cars in the future .
