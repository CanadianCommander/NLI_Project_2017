knowledge is the basic root of humanity development .it s the foundation of any developed country .knowledge can be gained from plenty sources .it could be wether from the internet , text books , researches or even from mass-media .but the point is which knowledge you intend to aquire .in which field you want to develop yourself .there are two kind of people when it comes to aquiring knowledge , the first one is prefer to be a wide knowledge man having a background in many fields , the second one prefer to be a professional one in his career .in my opinion and from my experience i think it s better to be a professional in a specific career rather than normal in many fields .high rate of life and with the variety of information and cultures proposed through television and satellite .the person may feel that he got lost inside all of that .knowing many information in many fields will make you lost inside them .consequently , you will not be a professional in your career .for example , am studying civil engineering , specifically in steel structure department and i think am a successfull man in doing my job and intending to get master s degree which will provide better life for me later by having a better job with higher salary .while being a person have a shallow background in many fields will not lead me to a better life .` best one among hundreds will take the seat  .that s mean that you have to fight in this time of life .you have to fight to find a job willing for a better life .having a job these days is so hard .so you have to improve your skills .you have to be a unique in order to get a respectable job , high salary ones .while being a broad knowledge man will not lead you to the point that life needs nowadays .once i heard a real story from a friend about finding a job in a multinational company .he told me that he went for an interview and surprisingly he found about one hundred and twenty person want to admitt for that job that will only choose one among them .i think that s enough to make me prefer to be a unique and professional man rather than being a broad knowledge one .nothing is perfect .everything has it s advantages and disadvantages .but we have to focus on what we need and what the life want from us .life is a good place if you come up with it s needs .to be a wide range knowledge person will probably help you in many situation you face each day .unfortunately , it s not the good time for that .life is narrowing your future path in one direction .which will definitly lead you to a better life and success in your career .
