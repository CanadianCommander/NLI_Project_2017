i totally concur to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group and led by a tour guide .a tour guide well acquinted with the places of visit and is very beneficial when its a place having historic importance .we had visited the vatican city during this summer .even after doing a entensive course work before going to the trip it was unavoidable from hiring a tour guide .gaining knowledge from books is always considered less than gaining knowledge from experience .it was easier for us to locate the places but we were literally confused when it came to the historic significance of the place .eventually , we landed up in hiring a tour guide which made our visit more pleasureable and even revealed a lot of unknown facts about the vatican city which we might not have known .the tour guide showed us each and every artifact of historic significance and also gave a brief description of the rituals carried out in the city .our trip was a success and even today it feels us with joy when we think about the vatican city trip .travelling in a group has its own charm and benefits in comparision to travelling alone .the most important and noticeable fact of travelling in a group is that we never get bored and the trip become more enjoyeable when the group consists of friends .as mentioned in the previous paragraph , we had been to vatican city during the summer .our group consisted of 5 members including me .we had distributed the task among ourselves which was quite helpful in planning the trip .i had the task of studying the maps and marking the places of interest on it whereas my other friends had various other tasks .the planning of the trip was so perfect that we saw each and every place on the map and were never late of any event .it would have been difficult for a single person to perform such a full proof planning .and even the expenses of the trip is also reduced considerable as the overall expenses are distributed among the group .the next time i plan a trip i would definitely plan it along with my friends and will always hire a tour guide .
