i completely agree with this statement because only by trying new things and taking risks people can improve their knowledge and prepare for a world that is constanly changing .besides , the only way people can discover their capacities and limits in almost every aspect of their everyday life is by trying new things and facing the risks associated to unknow situations .my own work experience has allowed me to realize the importance of trying new things and taking risks in order to be sucsesfull .over the last three years i have worked as an advisor of the president of federal electoral institute , mexico s electoral autorithy .during this time i have been constantly confronted with many new and unknow situations .althought i have had the opportunity to avoid this situations many times , and remain doing what i already knew , i soon reallized that the best way to learn new things and improved my self was to face them .as a result , i have not only adquiered a lot of experience in my field but i have also achieved the recognition of my boss and colaegues , as well as a salary promotion .in sum , because of the arguments presented above and my own experience i am convinced that facing new situations and taking risks is the only way to be successful and to improve every aspect of our lifes .as an old mexican saying states `` if you do not face risky situations , it is hard that you will ever win  .
