the human kind always need products for reach goodlife standarts therefore product is a very important aspect for the human s life .everyone has a different point of views about the idea of advertisement of product .some assume that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , in contrary to this some think that advertisements make products seem like they really are .i personnally agree with the first idea .these are my fallowing reasons :firstly , advertisement is related with money .advertisement is very important for firms , because with this , people can know their product very well .so , they buy their product .firms need advertisement for make money .moreover , for make a lot of money , they show their product much better then they really are .for example , they show them bigger or more confortable .they need this for sell a lot of products and for become rich .in addition to this , advertisement is related with art .i think that advertisement is a kind of art .for an advertisement , person find a lot of ideas .for my point of views , they are artists .they create a lot of different of ideas .in addition , a product become something totaly different from the reality .for example , i watch an advertisement not for learn new products , but for see an art .i listen the music of the advertisement , i see new countries or new places , i learn what the young people dress .an advertisement is a culture for me : it helps me to improve myself .on the other hand , advertisement is related with the real product .the first claim of an advertisement is to show product to people .it s necessary for person who do nt know this .people watch them for learn new product or for understand differencies from the other same product .so , advertisements show us the reality .despite to this belief , i personnally agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .all in all , as i said before advertisement is not related with the reality .it is related with both money and art .it is a showbusiness , so they show us all they want .i can said that it is not a honest work , it is only for make money .
