fifty years have witnessed the rapid development of the car industry .nowadays , the topic wether there will be fewer or more cars in use in twenty years than that of today has been hotly debated .although some people hold the opinion that there will be more cars in twenty years because of the develop of the ecnomy , some people believe that the car numbers will become fewer .personally , i am one of those believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .my view will be greatly sustantiated by the following discussions .the most persuasive point is that the science tecnologies are rapidly developping now .that means there will be some other veicles subsititue cars .according to some available surveys , it is said that over 60 percentages companies which are faminiar for their car producing are engaging in inventing new veicles .for example , the toyota company in japan has invest over 7 billions to invent new veecles , and some new productions were showed in the presentations during the past few years .furthermore , the resouces in our planet are not allow too much cars which comsume a great mount of energy to run in our society .accompaning with the development of the groble ecnomic , more and more countries especially china consum a lot fuels .not only do the gas has been greatly reduced but also other resurces .it is commonly believed that cars pay an important role in the reductions .if the number of cars are more that that of today , what other resouces will be provided to cars .in addition , the environments in the world areworsen now .there is a strong lik between an increasing the car numbers and the worsen pollution in our world .you imagine what it will be when almost every people drive themselves to work .recently , the stradegy of sustainable development has been widely spreaded , many measures relate to the policy will help the world to get fewer cars .taking into account all these factors which sometimes correatle together to generate an integrate whole and thus become more coving than any single one of them , we may safely draw the conclusion that the car numbers will be reduced in twenty years , that means there will be fewer cars than that of today .
