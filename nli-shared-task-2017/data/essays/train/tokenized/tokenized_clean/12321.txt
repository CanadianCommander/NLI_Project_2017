societies are bound together with the common values within their sharing and respect elements .however , young people are not struggling for understading their communities .for this reason , it is possible to argue that youth is the key element for understanding the combining values of a community however they are lack of this responsibility .three important reasons for this problem are the existence of variety in activities , people becoming more individual and lack of guidance from universities .one of the main problems of youth not to give attention to community occurs with the variety of activities that they can participate .existence of many attractive activities , social centers and even university clubs makes young people to choose one of the things that they like .for instance , if a student likes ceramics and learns an associated club in his university , he will possibly choose to perform his interest .this situation can be applied to many university students in which they are regretting the need of community help but rather choosing to accomplish their individual needs .secondly , because of the technological improvements and its achievement in reaching every person , people started to think more individually and for their own seek .for instance , the introduction of the internet to people especially stopped young people to take place in society and to communicate with each other .rather they spend their time surfing in the internet just looking for their own interest .because of this developing structure among the youth , it becomes harder to expect them in enrolling civic involvement works .with the existence of many tools forcing youth to become alone and individual , the less respect for the community would occur .universities are the most important centers for young people to shape their charachters but guidance for community work is missing in most of the universities .rather universities started to become institutions as a key figure for job applications and better living conditions .recent information also shows that universities are trying to affect students by their success rather than enforcing community values .as a result , lack of guidance towards community work also triggles the youth to become individuals .as a result , young people are rather studying and behaving for their own good .in the increase of this event there are important steps like university behaviors and technological improvements .but it is very important to reduce this behaviour of the youth for the common good of the society .
