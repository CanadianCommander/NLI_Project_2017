youth is one of the more common subjet in litterature or in social behaviour .now a days we are living a real obsession with youth , being youth , looking youth , keeping youth . ..and a reject with all that can suggest us that we are getting old each minutes we go throught .i agree with the satement that suggest that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i consider youth as the ideal state of human being .young people enjoy life because each day they are learning something new , beacuse their bodies are fresh and elastics , because they dont hace a headache if they drink two beers one night at the pub .they have a very good health and the consciense of ethernity , they are sure they will never die .energy , curiosity and inocence makes a young person a being that can enjoy life a lot , beacuse future belongs to themin the other hand , old people are often ill , not only in their bodies but also in their souls and minds , they have lived throught calamities , heart breaks , forgot , unforgivenness , death of other beloved partners , and thats why they have lost ( the bigger part of them , there is still many old people with hope and inocence ) all the features that can make a human being enjoy life .they do nt want to move for discover new things , they have lost curiosity .they lives in the past , remembering things that are not here today and they forget themselves , quitting the possibility of a happy present .romans and greeks wrote a lot about the sadness of leaving the youth island , with its pleasures and its swetness , for entering in the mature dessert where everything we do takes us lots of pain and effort .carpe diem , enjoy the instant , was their lema , their solution , the only way of being able to have a happy ancianity is to have lived a happy youth , because you never know whats going to happen with you tomorrow .thus , you wont leave heavy stones of frustration or hate for you in the last years of your life .be light in your early years and so u will in the later ones .
