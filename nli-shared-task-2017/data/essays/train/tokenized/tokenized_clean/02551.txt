my knowledge and my personal experience give me the reasons to agree with the statement .second my knowledge because it s true that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because young people do not have time to do it .in fact , in the third millenium , the time is a very big and important source .this concept born principally for the business world .the famous statement `` the time it is money  confirm my opinion .from the business people to the young people nowadays there is a very small difference for management time .as a very business man , the child must employ his twenty-four hours : school , sports and ...television !( social studies says that a child watch-in media - more of four hours of television at day ) .last but not least , the friends .where is the time to give to helping communities ?there is not !second my personal experience i agree with the statement that says that toung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .when i was i child i like give my time to helping my community , obviously second my personal skills .nowadays i am twenty five years old and i have not got time for helping my communities .first because my work do not give me more two free hours at day .second because i am married and i have got a son .i must help my wife in my free time !however i like help my community and i hope to achieve it .in my opinion the solution og the problem is in the manage of the time in particular of th efree time .
