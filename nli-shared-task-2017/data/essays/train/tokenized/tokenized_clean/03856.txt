i agree with this statement .i think it is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .it is because we need broad knowledge for all works , lefe and etcetra .i think that specializing on one specific subject are based on the broad knowledge .first , for example , we think of economist .truely , they are supecialized in the economic subject .but , they have a lot of knowledge broadly .it is because economists need to have various knowledge to think of economy .for instance .on thinking about economic plan with another county , they need the knowlwdge of the histry , relationship and some other about that coutry .second , in our life we need broad knowlege , too .for example , when we read the newspaper , ther are so much imformation of many things .if we do not have braod knowledge , i think i can not understand the almost of the news .it is because today s news are made of the histrical things , geografy things and so on .so we need broad knowledge to understand today s things .from these two points , i think it is impottant to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
