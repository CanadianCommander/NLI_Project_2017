i do not agree with the topic .i think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .one of the reasons for my disagreement with the statement is that twenty years ago there were fewer cars than today .i can remember going arround the city i live twenty years ago and there were not as many cars as there are today .so , if the world still growing the same way , in twenty years we will have plenty of cars in use .although i think cars are very usefull , i find the traffic very annoying for the day life , but i have to learn to live with it as i think the number of cars is going to rise even more than we have today .moreover , another reason to think that we will have more cars in the future is that the prices will get lower and people would be able to buy a car .ages ago a television was so expensive that only a few could buy it , but throughout the years the television has become so popular and common that the prices have low down .that is what i think it is going to happen with cars .i also think more second hand cars will be in sale , so people will be able to get them and as a result we will have more cars in use .in conclusion , i do not think in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today as the world is expanding so quickly and it is overcrowding over the years .
