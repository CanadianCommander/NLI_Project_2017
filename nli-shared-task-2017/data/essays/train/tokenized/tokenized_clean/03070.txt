as our world developed and became industrialized , the needs of cars had increased .however , in twnty years , will the needs of car continue or will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?i belive they will be fewer .the oil price has been increacing , and cars pollute our enviroment .more and more people are concerned with enviroment nowadays , and i believe there would be a better transportation in the future .as most people know , cars destroies our enviroment and pollute earth .cars have long been used in our history , and it has made improvements .there are cars that produces less carbon dioxcie , but they are expensive and only available to rich people .there are many people who would prefer those kind of cars , but i believe that those cars would not be available to everyone even after twenty years .in recent developing china , the needs of cars are increasing in incredible high rate .it might look as a good thing because china is begining to enter developed society and becoming industrialized .however it is a big propblem .china is one of the most populated countries in the world .if every family of china had a car and used the car , our world would be polluted and be done with in very little time .we can not stop china from developing .so in order to avoid that situation , we need new none eviroment polluting transportation .in the future all countries will develop in some ways .in conclusion , i belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and that there will be new transportation that is kind to earth .
