personally , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is for the following reasons .first , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive .second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be .in addition , young people do nt be educated to care about their communities .first , young people have to learn more skills to compete with other people for survive .today , with the economy growing , people have to earn more money to meet their material desires .in order to make a good living , they spend lots of time to learn skills .on the contrast , during the past , young people made a easy life , they would have more time to care about other people .second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be .today , young people are spoiled .their parents always provide them a good life .they can easily get anything they want , so they do nt appreciate the people who take care of them .therefore , they are getting more selfish .for example , one of my friends was born and grew up in a weathy family .he always thinks `` money is the world  .all he cares about is how much money he has .he totally ignore his family , friends and communities .in addition , young people do nt be educated to care about their communities .parents do nt set a good example for their children to take care or help their communities .young people need to learn how to be concerned about their communities .in brief , if young people nowadays put more attention on their communities , the whole society will be different .it will become warm and peaceful .
