i do not completely agree for the following reasons :it is said that a man/woman is most productive in their younger years .it the time when they can take the most from this world and give back the most .this may be due to the fact that they are mentally and physically more capable than small children or grownups and also because they are more enthusiastic about life .however , the involvement of the young in their own communities has decreased to quite an extent .they no longer take interest in what is happenning in their communities , or for that matter their own families .the main reasons are lack of time and concern .people have a busy schedule these days trying to manage their personal and professional lives .most people are too occupied making a successfull career that they are unable to find time for their families or the society .for some , their work and personal life have enough problems to even be concerned about their community .young people try and make the best out of their productive years to make a decent living and to plan for their future and the future of their families .however , it is not true for all people .there are still young people who are eager and willing to participate in community life and further develop it .there are young professionals who do social work apart from their regular jobs and try and give back something to the community .emerging young political leaders , especially in india , are an example to other young people who are determined in doing community service .others work for their communities as they see it as a source of satisfaction .what is needed is motivation and the realisation that one can not survive long being detached from his/her community and that it requires participation and constant improvement .eventually , everybody needs the comfort of the society or community once they have grown old and realising this fact would encourage young people to help their communities and address the problems that they face .
