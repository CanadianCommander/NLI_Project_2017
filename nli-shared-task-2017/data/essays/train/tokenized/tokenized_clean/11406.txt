at school , in each subject , we learn different things and the way to learn it can be different .in history , for instance , we learn more facts than we have to understand some process whereas in biology understanding ideas and concepts is the base of the course .i am convinced that is important and more interesting to understand some ideas and concepts but i think that is equally important to learn facts .first of all , i think that is interesting and challenging to understand some ideas and concepts we may provide a considerable concentration and it may take a long time we should have some difficulties as the result when we understand it , it providde some satisfaction .for example , i remember when i was at high school in a chemistry class , we had to analyse and understand how plants can do the photosynthesis .it appeared difficult but it was interesting and it motivated me to find this process .when i understood it , i was satisfactioned .although it seems to be very interesting , it is also important to leran facts even if it could be boring .in a nutshell , it s equally important to learn facts and to understand ideas .
