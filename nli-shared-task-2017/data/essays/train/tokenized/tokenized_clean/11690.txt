i disgree with the point that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .of course , no doubt understanding ideas and concept is very important .we need to apply ideas and concepts to reality .ideas and concepts are basic stuff .but it is a littile bit haste to conclude this result that understanding ideas and concepts is more important .the objective of understanding ideas and concepts is to practice .then the practice yields many facts .i think no idea and concept is perfect which is alway impeccable .though learning the facts , we can complement ideas and concepts .take an organic chemistry lab for example .absorbance of the solution .at first , we must look at the manual of the lab and grasp the principle of the lab .then we began to do the lab .sometimes we found it was not true that the absorbance was proportional to the concentration .it seemed against the rule .that was a fact .we need to find the real reason leading to the result .last we found absorbance was affected by many factors .temperture and humity can control the result .ideas and concepts are very deep and hard to understand which are forgotten quickly .by facts , we often easily understand ideas and concepts .facts are vidid .most students are tired of lot of study .facing to textbooks is a hard thing for a long time .but facts give us a direct feeling which inspire our interest and imagination .sometimes it is amazing that we grasp ideas and concepts so easily and quickly .and many new inventions are generated by facts .for instance newton principle .if newton did not see the process of falling down the apple , newton principle will not exist .we do not deny the importance of understanding ideas and concepts which is most basic .if we do not understand ideas and concepts , we can not learn anything from facts .facts , ideas and concepts are indispensible .if we can do well by them together , we will do better .
