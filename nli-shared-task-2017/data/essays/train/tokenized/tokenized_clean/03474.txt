`` play it safe.  is the thing we often hear from our families , friends and from other people .we see many people regretting about their past , for they lived in a routine and never took the chances they had just because they thought it was risky .it is well known that the richest man in my country was broke and homeless in his childhood .to me , taking risks is the main gate to success and happiness in your life , since that may be only chance for you to make your future dreams come true and not to regret in your prospective life .in three months , i will receive my diploma and become a physician .the tendency of medical graduates is to specilize on a clinical branch and practice privately .i have not applied for the graduation exam yet and i will not , instead i am applying for a research scholarship in japan and planning to complete a doctoral course there .it is obvious that it will be more challenging and time consuming , but i think that once i receive a degree in japan , a door to study abroad academically will be open .but the door may permenantly be closed ; too .i am acting in an unorthodox way ; but as robert frost says : `` i took the one less travelled by , and that made the difference .`` if only i had the chance ...  , `` i wish i could use this chance ...  are the words i never intend to use and in my opinion , regret is the worst feeling one can has in his life .time passes by and there is no chance to reverse it .the only thing that one can do is to anchor to that chance and go for it no matter how risky the situation is , so that he will not find himself in a routine life and he will never experience the feeling of regret .not to feel regret in any of the steps of your life is actually what i perceive from the word `` peacefulness  .in summary , i can say that taking risks is the main taste of life that leads to success and the source of happiness hides in a mind that has no idea of regrets about the past .
