everybody wants to be successfull in life , nevertheless only some people achive this .i m firmly agree with the statement that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in the present essay i will endouver to figure out my reasons .from my point of view , one of the major factor in reaching success is self-development .but how can it be possible while always doing the same things .you should try new things to reach better solutions .otherwise you can not develop what you are doing .moreover in our high compettative era it is more difficult to be successful .because everybody endeavor to do their best , you must do something different .being different always make you more easy to being recognised , nevertheless you must try something different , even something never tried before .and this means risk .when we consider the successful people lived in the history , we see a common point .this is risk taking .although there are many people in history who has taken risk and than fail , i think we must be thankful for their effort because we have reached our modern era with the efforts of such kind of people .for instance madam currie risked her life to find some radiactive materials .but she made a huge progress in chemistry area .in conclusion , i want to remark that doing what we already know how to do well , without taking risk in lfe , we can not make progress .from my point of view success is worthwhile to take some risks in life .
