when we are in a highly industrilized booming society , how can we imagine the future ?will the quantity of cars be fewer in use in twenty years than there are today ?i think the answer is an absolutely no for all the merits of them .cars are one of the most practical and useful inventions through the last centruries .as the high technology soars up , cars also has been greatly modified for the benefit of people .we can get a scenic spot far more quickly than before with cars which have save much time for us to rest or to stay in the right spot in the duration of our travelling .we can enjoy the beautiful scenes we meet on our way , pull aside the car whenever and wherever you want .this is impossible when you are on a train .cars make us feel more friendship between our friends and us .we can call in on our friends who live far from us whenever we want .we do not have to schedule our visit plans and be bothered by the unappropriate timetable of buses and trains .when a friend is in trouble , we can drive a car immediately and help him .reversely , our friends will do all the favor for us with a car in hand .another merit is driving a car make us feel more self-satisfactory .when you charge a car which you buy it with your salary and bring your whole family , how happy and self-accomplished you feel !this can not be denied .admittedly , people will say that they bring us polluted air and unhealty , what s more , some lung and cardiovascular diseases .the traffic jams seem never stop .the fossil fuel makes people feel disgust .as to these , i d say that it is not car s fault .cars do not originally be made to harm people .they are beneficial machines .technology often brings good and bad , whether it is a curse or a blessing , depends on how to control and modify it , and just the technology itself can solve the problems .so do cars .we have to take out more measures than before as the increasing population which will really be possible that more people will charge a car .more roads will be estabilished whatever are under the original roads or above .more traffic administration should be put in force .and the foremost , the alternative material for fuels should be invented to get rid of the demerit of cars-polluting emission .if these problems have been settle , cars will be more welcome to people .it is more than possible , every one want to own a car in twenty years .
