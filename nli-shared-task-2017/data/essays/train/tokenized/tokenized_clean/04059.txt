in my opinion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .i am of this opinion for different reasons : firstly , you need the knowledge of many different academic subjetcts to understand a specific subject totally .for example , you can not understand literature without historical knowledge .knowing what a novel or play is about is just not enough , additionally you must know something about the time in which the literature was created or the society the author lived in .this knowledge will not be presented in literature class , so you need to deal with history , too .secondly , studying one specific subject is only succesful if you have thought about the subject from all possible perspectives .understanding something only from one point of view creates the risc that you do not know enough about critics or different opinions .for example , there are many different opinions about evolution .if you are specialized on biology only , you will never learn some other theories or you will never understand how american theologists can argue against darwin s evolution theory .additionally , a reason why i think that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is the better option , is that some specific subjects contain questions that can not be answered by this specific subject alone .a very good example is medicine : you can study medicine without ever getting in touch with ethics , but during your career , you will need ethical knowledge to make some important decisions .it is impossible to be a good doctor if you are only interested in medicine ; you have to be interested in ethics and the human society in general , too .in conclusion , we can say that the best way is deciding which subject you are the most interested in then and study on it .at the same time you always have to keep in touch with other academic disciplines to become not only an expert of one specific subject , but to get a wide general knowledge .
