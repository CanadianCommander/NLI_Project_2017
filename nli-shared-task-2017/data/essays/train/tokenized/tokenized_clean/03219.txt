i do not agree with this statement because i think that it is more useful to know only a few subjects deeply than many in a superficial way .i think that everyone , especially students who go to the university , should have a general cultural knowledge but this is something that goes beyond the accademical role .in my opinion it does not make any sense to attend a class about a course you are not interested in or that does not have anything to do with what you really want to study for your future job .unfortunately , i personally experienced something similar during the past three years because when i started university i did not know what i was going to study precisely and as i wanted to graduate in languages and litterature i thought , as most of the other people in my class , that i was not going to study anything else except from economics in which i wanted to specialise .could you immagine my delusion when i found out i had to study many useless subjects ?why did i have to study things like philosophy or history when i knew i was not going to use it in my future ?in my opinion the decision of students to go to university is something very individual and it has to be respected , from the governament as the educational institutions .i believe that it is up to the secondary school the responsability of teaching the general subjects and when a student goes to the university this must be taken for granted .finally if you really want to be strong in your future job and you really want to do it in the best way you can , you have to focus on it and learn as much as you can about the subjects related to it .why should a future manager want to know something about
