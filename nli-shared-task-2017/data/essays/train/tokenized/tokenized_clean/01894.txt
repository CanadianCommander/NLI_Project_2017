knowing about many academic subjects may sound good at the first sight .it may sound like , a person has educated him/herself quite well so that he/she knows many things .but i think it does nt work that way , specializing in one spesific subject is much more important than broad knowledgedge of many academic topics .first ; how far can a person may go in many academic subjects all together ?in other words it is impossible for a person discover fundemental aspects of many academic subjects at the same time .at this point , actually it can not be inferred that the subjects are known by the person .knowing is far beyond having only an idea about something .in contrary , focusing on one unique subject will make it possible to learn deep details of it .by this way , one can claim that he/she knows the subject .related to the points mentioned so far , the industry nowadays is quite aware that experts on a subject are quite valuable .since technology and industry developes quite fast , improving a new thing bacema quite hard and it needs indepth knowledge of the subject .therefore focusing on a spesific academic subject will definetely rise a person s chance in his/her career .another point is that , if a person can manage to specialize on an academic or another subject , this gives great satisfaction .namely , the person will be in demand and maybe will be the first name that the people around remembers about the subject .in contrary  it is very hard to get this domination satisfaction by knowing little about many topics .to conclude , it would be much better to specialize in one spesific acadamic subject rather than having knowledge of many of them .this will help a person in career and in practical life .knowing something needs really good spesific focusing .
