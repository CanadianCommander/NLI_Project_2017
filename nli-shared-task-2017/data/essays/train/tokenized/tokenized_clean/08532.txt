even bad marketing is marketing .in my opinion a successful person is someone who takes risks and tries new thinks .i am the best exmple for this statement :two weeks ago , i had an interview at the walt disney company for an internship .of course i could have come to this interview as every one else : nicely dressed , conservative and serious .i would show him my image of a good teammember and some other strengths .so i would have had a nice interview and maybe a chance to get the job .but i wanted to get a better chance on the job : so i came as the comic figure daisy .i wore a white blouse with a daisy pin and a nice skirt , combined with a pink bow in my hair .i knew that my behaviour was not usual and i was aware of the risk i was taking with this strategy .first of all , everybody looked at me when i came in , so i got the full concentration on my person .it was a little bit risky , because this attention can be positive or negative , but for sure they will remember me .furthermore , my interviewer could see that i am an outspoken person with motivation to get the job .of course , the image of daisy matched with the job offer i was applying for .i had to fight for the very first minutes of the interview to give the interviewer the impression that i am still a serious , conservative and trustful worker but it was worth it .the interviewer gave me the job right away and when i asked why he decided so quick he said :you applied for the job in an unusual way and showed me that you are able to think out of the box .actually , we were looking for someone who takes risks to achieve his goals and you are this person .
