i can say that i agree with the statement above .to my mind , it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts that to learn facts .i think that a true learning experience comes from a complete understanding of some key points .facts are something that can support the key concepts that you have in mind , and help you memorize them , but can not be the principal elements of a learning experience .i would nt call ` learning  what is instead a simple memorization of facts .i will take history as an example .history is usually treated as a subject that requires students to memorize a lot of facts .this is not completely correct .of course , you will need to remember some key dates to organize the information you have collected from classes and from your text book , but this will not help you understand the importance of a particular event or of a specific historical period .you will need to understand the main ideas that are behind that event or that period .otherwise , you will not have learnt anything , you will just have done some memorization exercise .of course , you can not study a subject without needing to memorize any fact .i will take one more example .a student of medicine will need to study anatomy , which is also considered as a tough subject because there are a lot of names to memorize .nobody can be a good doctor without a solid knowledge of the parts of the human body and of their names .therefore facts are also important .nevertheless , if there is nt any concept that connects those facts , you will not have any knowledge .facts alone have no meaning if there is no supporting idea or concept behid them .this is the reason why students of medicine will learn anatomy in an organised way , : the parts of the body are classified in different categories , and this will help students understand how the human body works .finally , there is another important factor to consider : the human brain can not retain a lot of information for a long period of time .if you simply learn names or a series of facts without any connection , without any concept behind them , you will soon forget what you have been trying to learn .
