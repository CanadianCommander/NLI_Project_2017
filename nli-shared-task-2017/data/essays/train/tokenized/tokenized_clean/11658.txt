with the technology developing so fast today , we have to say that the science and technolgy have have changed our world a lot .and transportaion also has improved a lot comparing to what it is years ago .now air planes , undergrounds , ships are widely used in transportaion .but if one says that in tewnty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .i strongly disagree with the view .first of all , cars are really convinient for people to travel , especially when the trip is short .it can drives from one place to another quickly .for example , in the cities we are live in , we have to work , study or see friends everyday .if one has a car , it can save him a lot of time everyday .no need to stand in a line for the bus and being hurry to catch a underground in order not to be late .cars provide people with a good way to avoid the problems mentioned above .for this reason , more and more people will buy cars on their own .seconly , it is necessary for a family to own a car .a case to prove the point is a example of mine .we have a car of our own .so when we want to go out for a trip , we can drive there ourselves .it liberates my parents from arranging a ticket or finding the ways we should follow .sometimes we can not go to a place because there is no transprtation to there in the past .so with the demands of the families , there will be more cars on the roads in the future .more and more families would like to have cars at that time .lastly , we can find out that it is more and more busy on the ways now that before .maybe in the future there maybe other kinds of car to subsitute the cars we are using now .for the cars are comfortable and convinient , no other transportation can replace them .and it will also be cheaper in future , so having a car is the first choice of many people , just like the bikes today in china .from all above , we can get to the conclution that cars are taking a important part in people s everyday life .nothing else can substitute it in many aspects .so to the oppsite of the point that mentioned in the theme , i think there will more people choose cars as their first transpotation when they are out and certainly there will be more cars in twenty years .
