i completely agree with the statement of ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  for several reasons .the first and foremost one would be the safety and comfort offered by your companiens in group , especially when traveling to new places farwaway from home town .in case of any unexpected emergencies or untoward events happening on travel , you have a gropu to take care of your needs and shre the burden and sterss .secondly , the guided tours would provide right information about theplaces and one can get more precise information about the place visited for the first time .also , a guided tour in a gropu is more economical over personal tour with or without a guide .the guides are trained to perform the tours on a timely manner while explainig the fact in detail .when you are in a group , you would spend less money on travel , accomodation , and money spent on engaging a travel guide .tough it may not be possibl to spend their time as one wishes , while travelling , it provides the opportunity to ineract with other people in group and know more about the places than it would be other wise .i provide a typical example , to justify my opinion .it is about my travel in india last year .i have to spend about $ 150 to go to a historic place all by myself in a taxi , while it costs only a fraction of that , i.e $ 5 if i choose to travel by public transport that was available .i choose to go by taxi as i was alone and afraid of travelling in publice transport system along with the many locals , for fear of isolation as i do nt under stanfdthe la thus in conclusion , a guide tour in groups is , safe , economical and time saving .
