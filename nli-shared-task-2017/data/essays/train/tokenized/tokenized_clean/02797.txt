i think , facts are always real and has been observed by many peoples in the society , i have seen many examples like , if you do nt try to work hard in your business and just having idea and concept , thats is not going to help , because you do nt know what is the fact why i am not succeding .further more , facts are always truth can be veri fied any time in life .every things you can nt hide from peoples .if you will find out what is the problems then it has to be verified .its takes time but you will find the ways of your problems .for example , many kids does wrong in theire life , after they tried to hide that some times parents also supports that but that is not good idea because one day he will realise than he fel soory and regreat for theire parents what they teach us .facts are always learn by situation , like you made a mistake in your life that mistake or accident allow to you learn and you will facts .i am telling my example , i went three times for driving test was unsucees then after being master in driving how ?i learned lesson what i made mistake than i learned facts .some times understanding ideal and concept help to people finding problems but they can nt realise without gettint facts at last , facts are always real and leanred by mistakes .when peoples realise the facts they should try to improve
