when students have to prepare a test they study on notes they took at lessons and read the book to well learn the topic .we can split two methods to learn , one using the facts and one using the ideas and the concepts .mainly students at first learns the facts , in fact is more easy for a person store a fact than understand a concept , but sometimes it is not enough to be well prepared for a school test .sometimes is nedded to know the ideas and the concepts who are back on the fact , they are more difficoult to learn becouse the person can understand and compare the main ideas of the facts just once a person well know the facts , .i think that is more important for students to undersdtand the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn the facts becouse if you know the ideas and the concepts it mean you well know the facts , and sometimes if you forget the facts you can remember the ideas and than remember the facts .anyway , in some particoular situations is better know the facts than understand the ideas and the concepts , it appens rarely for me , for example when i am delaied with my studies and i have a very few time before a test , so i need to study the topic as fast as is possible for me .for someone it is a common way to study but i think when a person store just the fact he will be not able to remember it in a large scale time , becouse the human s memory is more able to store ideas and concepts than it is able to store facts for long time .a personal example is what i learned in the past when i was a child , i well remember the ideas and the concepts but i really ca nt remember the facts , it can be just a characteristic of my mind so it mean that my idea is wrong for another peson .
