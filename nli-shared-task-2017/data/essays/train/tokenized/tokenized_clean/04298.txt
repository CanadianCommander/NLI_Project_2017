young people enjoy life more than older people do .i do support the following satement .young people enjoy their life in different patterns than the older people do .the old age people mostly prefer to spend their time by taking the rest instead of enjoying their life , the old peopleprefer to take rest is mainly because of their health problems , they mostly prefer to concertrate on keeping their health in a balanced state instead of enjoying .their daily schedule is widely different fro the young people , their daily life is more common compare to children and the young age people .the old age people are unable to play games as do like the young people .the old age people mainly wants to stay home and do the gardening , their life does not resemble most to the young age people .most of the young people enjoy their life in different fashions , by wearing different kinds of clothes , by visting theatres and chit chatting with the friends .the young people enjoyment is highly unique compare to the enjoyment of old age people .the old people have less compliance than young people eg : old people showing least preference to visit outside viewing , going to the dance parties , doing different innovative things .today the life is more modernized than few centuries ago , more enjoyment in the life is widely seen in the young people than old age people .as per my personal beleif is that , theyoung people enjoy their life more than old people do .once again i strongly do support this statement by agreeing .
