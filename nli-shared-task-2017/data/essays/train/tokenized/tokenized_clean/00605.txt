the business of selling products is quite hard .the decision making process of the customer depends on the usage and the price of the product .so you have to be the sheapest one or you have to provide an innovation .if you are not one of these you have to find a way to be noticed by the customer .one possibilty is to show the customer a product which differs from the real one .the illegal tuning / upgrading of advertisements with non-real informations or visual parts could be defined as `` lying to the customer  , but it is a possibility to increase your current selling amout .the problem of this difference between the advertisement and the reality is , that the customer will realize these normally after the buying process .as a result the customer will not buy any product of your company in future because the think that you are not providing the products which you offer in your advertisements .so you are able to increase your current selling amout by `` tuning  your advertisements , but on the long run you will decrease the selling amout of all your products ( not only the product you have communicated in the advertisement ) .marketing is becoming more and more important in the business of management a company .but marketing says , that you should have a look to the customer to find their needs and to provide a product which helps the customer to solve their problem .marketing doesent mean , that you should sell a fridge to the north pole .the importance of the companys brand is increasing all the time because the customer doesent have the time or the knowledge to evaluate a product .so the customer will decide on subjective criteria if he will buy a product from company a or company b. because of this you have to take care of your advertising decision because they will infect the future of your whole company .further it is illegal to tell the customer facts which are not true .so the customer or your competitor can hire a lawyer which will be fight against you in front of a judge .this is not really good public relations for your company .in my opinion you should not lie to the customer because this will infect your company negative on the long run and you are not only responsible for your margin , as well for your employees .
