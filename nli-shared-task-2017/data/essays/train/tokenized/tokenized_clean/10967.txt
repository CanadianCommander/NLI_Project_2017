both learning facts and understanding ideas are important .neither one of them dominates another .on the one side , learning facts helps people to get experience so that they can understand and generate ideas better ; on the other side , the ability which people has to understand ideas affects people s performance to learn facts .everyone starts to learn things from learning facts first .for example , young children start to learn facts when they start to go to school .they might learn that seventy five percent of the surface of the earth area is covered by water .this knowledge is not from understand ideas but from facts .another example is that young children learn that fire burns and hurt people by touching fire because they have no idea about fire before they get hurt .however , only learning facts would not help students to get knowledge effiently , they must go to school or somewhere else to learn ideas .for example , some of the the knowledges learned by students at school are ideas .when students have enough knowledge and ideas , they would learn facts deeper and broader .understanding ideas and learning facts should not be separate .both of them are the ways to help students to abtain knowledges .
