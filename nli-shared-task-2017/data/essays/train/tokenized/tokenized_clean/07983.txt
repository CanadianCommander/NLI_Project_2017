it is ofcourse more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i completely agree with the above given statement .learning is an imporant part of a person s life .right from the time when a child is born , he learns to eat , to drink , to walk , to play and so on .after some time , he learns to study and takes the student s life .at school , teachers teach him various subjects as a result of which he needs to learn facts .he mugs up these facts in order to excel as a student .i , however , think that just learning and mugging up facts is not the requirement attaining success .this does not serve the purpose of education .on the other hand , an understanding of the ideas and concepts is what holds importance .one should get a clear knoledge of the ideas which have been explained in a subject matter .when a student gathers knoledge and information in this way , he becomes able to successfully apply these concepts in his life .this not only helps him as a student but also becomes useful in his future .a successful student then becomes successful in his professional life as well .this is because he learns to use his knoledge into practicality .the above stated reasons clearly stress and explain my point of view .according to me , getting students to learn facts and ideas other than mugging up facts can be encouraged only with the help of the educational institution .i hence conclude my essay by saying it is only possible when thereis a change in the attitude of the teachers who are a part of the educational institutions such as schools , colleges and universities .teachers will have to explain the imporance of understanding ideas instead of learning things nd encourage them to studyin this manner .
