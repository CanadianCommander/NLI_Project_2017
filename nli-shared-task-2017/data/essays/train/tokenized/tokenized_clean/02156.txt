i would agree on the point that most products advertised are not as good as they are portrayed in the advertisements .the reason for my belief is that the advertising companies get a lot of money from the manufacturers to make their ad look better .and due to this the make the product look very flash and attractive in the advertisements even if it is the most hideous product .advertisement is the best marketting stratergy that decides the sale of the products and the companies success .in order to ahieve certain targets and to attract more customers the companies advertise their items in a manner that makes them more desirable to the viewers .to do this they add certain features which the might not be able to provide .they spend a lot of money on these ads .for example , a cell phone company x adverstises its phone that has all the features except a very bright coloured handset that might attract people .so the advertisers usually enhance the colour of the handset in the adds that people like to see .they modify the product with the help of the computer techniques .this might be misleading for the viewers of the ad if they order the handset just because of its colour .most people believe in what the see in the advertisements and order the products on the basis of the ads .this can lead to viewers forming a wrong opinions about the products too .giving a personal example , i ordered an entertainment book which according to the advertisement had all the addresses of the tourist places in and around newyork but when i finally got the book in hand i discovered that the book had only a few selected place and it did not include all the important tourism spots for eg. the museum of modern arts or the radio city hall in manhattan .how could any book miss that ?on the basis of the reasons and examples citied above and on the basis of my experience i would finally conclude that the advertisemnets are often misleading and do not provide the exact information and the viewers should go into the details of the product before buying them .
