i would like to go with the idea that younger people can enjoy life more vividly than older people do .there are many significant factors to support this idea of younger people exploring the life as much possible as they can and how they go about life in a manner to have sweet memories for their rest of life .if i consider a teenage boy/girl , he/she will be having vigor and enthusiasm to go out for parties and hang around with friends which account for their extremely extravagant events which they can cherish later at somepoint in their lifetime after getting older .older people may not have that much energy as the young people to do whatever they want .their physical health may not support their idea to enjoy even though they are very much ready to enjoy .though enjoyment does nt come only in physical form .they can also enjoy .older people will have to depend upon somebody in their family to go around exploring life as they did when they are young .but this may not be possible always as the other members in the family will be having work and responsibilities of their own such as taking care of children , going to office and preferences towards their own enjoyment in life .as a result in some societies , the older people are being sent to retirement homes where they share their rest of life with their peers .but this is not a good culture as it denies the fact of being together in the family .the older people can not enjoy their life as they feel alienated from the society which can worsen the situation .they should be regarded as an important part of the society as they love their family members for whom once they cared and gave in all the possible ways for them to enjoy life .in my opinion , enjoyment lies in one s perception towards it .although younger people can enjoy life more than older people do , they can consider for older people s enjoyment by mingling with them as they get chances to make the rest of older people s life lively .
