when it comes to the questions of whether it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for the students to learn facts , different people might have totally different answers to the question .in my view , it is more important for the students to learn facts .the reasons go as fellows .first of all , the facts are about experience .to learn the facts can make the study more practical .considering that if a student just learn the idea and the concepts in his or her study , he or she just know what it is because the concept told him or her .however , he or she may not understand how to use it or what it is for to learn such thing .the problem is that they did not related the idea and concept to facts .they should learn to analysis facts use the learning of concepts , making their study more practical .in addition , it is more usefl for the students to learn facts .as we know , the purpose for people to study ideas and concepts is to use it and make contribution to our lives .our lives consist many of facts , and we need to study the facts and make them useful to us .if we just study ideas and concepts , it means nothing to our scociety .the ideas and concepts are just the basis of facts .it is ture that we need to learn the ideas and concepts first and then we can learn and understand the facts better .it is also true that leaning ideas and concepts is the basis thing for us to practice our knowledge .i also admit that ideas and concepts play important role in human study .however , in comparision with the importance to fianlly get used to our lives , facts is more important .in conclusion , based on the resons i discussed above , even though others may have totally different opinoins with me , i still belive that facts is more important .
