the question if it is better to have a broad knoledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is quite difficult .there are three point to discuss about this question .the first point is taht having a broad konwledge can help you in finding a job because as much as you know as vary can be the fields in with you can deal with .moreover you will be able to take part in a variety of subjects with people and this can help you to socialise when you are in a new environment with peolple you do nt know .third , you can link different informations and create a personal point of view .on the other hand , specialize in a certain subject can help you to become a leader in your job field and an expert .furthermore you can speak deeply about your subject in a conversation , and you can use it for appealing people who listen to it and make a strong impression .finally , you can teach or give specific informations to other persons in a conversation helping them to understand new matters far away of their fields of interest .as far as i am concerned , i agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge and i am quite sure that a broad knwledge is better that a specific one .my experience teach me this .i attended social and political studies at university an this is a very broad knowledge course. : later in life it has been reallly useful in my job , in understanding the worlds and make me flexible in learning new tasks .for all these reasons , i think it can be helpful in daily life an for yourself as human being .in the end , i think one mus nt stop learnig in life , i would like to continue to study the subjects i prefer and learn new ones that can be help me to be a better person .
