it is known that several products do nt fulfil all the requirements , which have been presented by saling of these products .therefore , i agree with the idea that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .however , i can understand the reasons because these products have been produced and saled on that way .the economical system of the most countries in the world is the capitalism .in this system people have to earn their own money by buying products or by doing an activity or work .that means there must be some people to sale products and other ones to buy them .if nobody buys a particullary thing , the market will stop producing that object .the production of that thing would be wasting money .indeed , the best way to make money must be found .because of this , the trade of products became important and the market could be invented .its development helps the politico-economical situation of each country .on the one hand , there must be the posibility to buy necesary products like food and clothes .offering the necesary products with acceptable prices , the market gives facilities to get these products in accesible places ( e.g. food stores ) .on the other hand , it is not possible that every store sales similar products .therefore , the market tries to discover new products which have to get necesary in the new society .this opens the posibility to create new articles and activities .altrough the human society is changing and new products are being invented , people do nt buy all the products , because they are nt convinced of the quality .perhaps they do nt realize the advantages of having that new product .therefore , advertisements have to present the products on way that convice the persons to buy them .i can understand this situation in the market and i think that this way is sometimes necesary to keep the economical situation of a country stable .
