the statement expressed is one thing people and particularly all researchers of mobility would like to know .from the first car appeared in our lives , their quantity has not stopped of increase .so , which will be the future for the car ?nowadays car is an important part of our life .we use it for everything because everything is easier with it .on average a normal citizen could move around 20 kms per day with his car to go to work , shopping or whatever .that s seems is going to be the most predictable future thanks to be the most comfortable way of living .however there is something that grows at the same pattern as cars : traffic .a lot of researchers say that traffic is the disease of the actual cities .when it appears is nearly impossible to control it .this is something that goes against cars because when people last double time to do the same route , one question start to appear : do i have other method of transport ?in fact our society have a variety of transports we had never imagined , but they are not so easy-going as cars are .although it is proved that they are faster and cheaper than our cars , people do not like them .statements like bus is crowded , i have to walk a lot to the train station . ..are very common and set public transport behind cars , except when they do not depend on traffic jams and allow people sleep some minutes more before going to work .environment is another thing we have to take care .kyoto protocol is clear in that aspect : the most production of greenhouse effect gasses is caused by private transport .so it is not so difficult than in a 20 years time cars would be banned from downtown , like in london happends at this moment .as a conclusion predictions about cars are difficult to state .everything depends on human behaviour , environmental consciense and political response .who could imagine a world without cars ?me !
