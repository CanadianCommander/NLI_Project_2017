this statement has some truth to it , but the level of truth depends on the situaion and stage of life .also , capabilities differ from person to another .in my opinion , as a child one must be subjected to a wide range of subjects and as one grows older he or she will be able to make life affecting choices , one can then chose a specific subject to specialize in and study in depth .children are young and naive , it will be a crime to allow a seven year old to chose whether he wants to continue learning mathematics or not .in many schools , students are obliged to take certain subjects as part of the curriculum , but as they approach higher levels , such as high school , they may be asked to chose whether they would like to continue taking a specific subject or not .moreover , by then , the student should atleast have an idea of the field ( s ) he or she would like to specialize in at university , and persue a career in that field in the future .as a child grows older , he or she will come to know his or her interests , strenghs and weaknesses .in most schools , once a student is in high school , he or she will be required to chose whether to be in the arts or scientific section , this is very beneficial because the student will be able to promote his time and thinking to subjects he or she is likely to persue and major in for the rest of his or her life .university is the most important stage of life , here one will be able and obliged to chose the field of study he is interested in and is passionate about persuing a career in .normally , this will be the final stage of choosing a speciality .this is why the statement above is relatively true , but not in all stages of life .and one must be very careful in choosing the specific subject to study .
