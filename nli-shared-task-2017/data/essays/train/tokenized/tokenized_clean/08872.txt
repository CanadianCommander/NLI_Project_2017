there is the arguement whether young people or older people enjoy life the most .some may argue that older people might enjoy life the most , since they think they are getting older and might die soon .but i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do for many different reasons .young people want to live life to the fullest , and are willing to experience more than older people .for example the tought of dying is not as present in a young person s mind as it would be in an older person .therefore the young person is more likely to live the moment and not worry so much in the concequences that it might have in the future .another reason for arguing that young people enjoy life more , is that a younger person is healthier than an older individual .by being healthier the person has more mobility , and energy to do more activities , and travel around the word .now days there is more technology that young people now how to use to their benefits , making their lives easier , leaving more time for entertaining activities , and leasure time .unlike younger people old people s health as good .as time passes by the body gets weaker and loses its strength .there are more older individuasl suffering from a dissease which limitites their mobility , than younger people .older people have more thing to worry about that younger people , such as children and bills .a lot of older people are not used to the technology that is offered now days , therefore most of them might not be encourage to using , and trying new things .their health , their stronger bodies , the mentallity , the willing to try new things , and the technology used by young people .unlike them older people lack of health and are more resistant to try new stuff .and for those are the different reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older people .
