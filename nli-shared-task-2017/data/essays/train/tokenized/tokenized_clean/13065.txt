the question if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years , than there are in use today , is a controversal topic .people may argue that cars get abundand in the futur due to further development of alternative transportation methods or by concerns about the environment .i however , do not agree with this staatment .i even think cars get more and more important and that car use will increas in the next twenty years .the use of cars is an still will be important especially for working people .statistiks show that people have to travell longer and longer distances to their workplace , and in the future this distance will still increase .a lot of people move out to the suburbs and consequently have a longer way to work each day .i think this development will continue in the futur and will increase the cars in use .furthermore flexibility is a charakteristik that is getting very important these days .companys want there employee to be flexible and let them travel for work a lot .this flexibility can be given by the car and will increase its use .another important reason why there will be more cars in use in twenty days than today is that the population on earth is increasing rapidly .if population is increasing the use of cars will increase as well because more people lead to more cars .but not only workingconditions and the increasing population are reasons agains the reduction of cars in the futur .as well the vacationhabbit of people will lead to the opposit .as the world gets closer togehter by globalisation , open boarders and a common currency for example , travelling gets a lot easier than it was in the past .people use this advantages and travell a lot and i think travelling by car will get more and more popular .last but not least i argue that because of new technologies and production methods , cars get cheaper in the futur and therefore get accesable to more people which will defenetly not decrease the cars in use .for these reasons i stated above i think the statement that cars in use will be fewer in the futur is incorrect .
