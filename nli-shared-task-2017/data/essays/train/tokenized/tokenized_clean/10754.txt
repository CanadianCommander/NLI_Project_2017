basically i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .what do you think the meaning of ` enjoy  ?young people can enjoy more kinds of sports than old people do because their physical condition allows more chance to do like snow board , motorcycle , mountain climbing , sky diving which are need more wild actions and physical abilities .no one can say old people can enjoy these sports too .the sports is one of the most important way of enjoying our life .furthernore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life .for example , they have to consider their family and company before challenging new things .however young people feel more free to launching new things .they are much bravier than old people so that they can experience more about new world eventhough they fail sometimes .that is o.k for young people because they have plenty of time to recover their fail or mistakes .therefore , young people can enjoy life more than old people .i did nt mean old people can not enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people .
