consdering how rapidly the technology is advancing , i believe that the use of cars will be greatly reduced twenty years from now .at every passing moment , scientists are coming up with new ideas to make people s lives easier .currently , one of the challenges that await them is the ease of transportation .for longer distances , the planes are highly efficient means of transportation , but for shorter distances , we are bound to use cars or similar vehicles like buses .there are already steps taken towards this issue .the `` ginger  , also known as segway , was invented for people to travel short distances quicker and without hassle .i am confident that better variations of it will be created in twenty years  time .these may include flying vehicles , which can be easily navigated even through streets .at first , they may not be appealing either due to their prices or due to non-familiarity , but after a period of adaptation , they would be more commonly used and eventually they would replace cars .this is exactly what happened to horse-ridden vehicles when the first car was introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century .moreover , there is an increasing concern for air pollution generated by the excessive use of cars .people are getting more inclined to use alternative methods of transportation like bicycles .it is true that some people are not aware the impacts of the pollution generated by cars .however , they are , too , getting reluctant to drive a car since the oil prices are increasing rapidly , whereas the oil sources are depleting rapidly .the traditional car will be of no use when there will be no fuel left to run it from twenty to thirty years from now .there will be vehicles running with alternative energy sources , but i believe that they will not be considered as cars in the traditional sense .when all of these different factors are brought together , i can say that people will willingly give up using cars one way or the other , reducing the number of cars that are in use in twenty years  time .
