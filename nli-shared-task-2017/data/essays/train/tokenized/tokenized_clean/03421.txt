peopel can not live without joy .both young and old people look for somethig good for theri lives .i am getting old .i want to say older people can enjoy theirl lives like young people do , however , it is difficult for older people to enjoy like youg people do .health situations are very differencet between young and oler people .most young people do not worry about their health , but many older people have chronic diseases .for example , some people might have back pain .the pain limits their daily actibity and makes them be unhappy .older people s rest of time is not long .they already lived many years , and they know that they can not make a big dream like they had when they were very young .today s their dreams might be very real and small .young people have a abandant time , so they can have big dreams about their futures .everybody wishes haveing enjoy life .however when people get old , ther health situation is not good .moreover , they can not have big dreams .thsu , i think young people can enjoy thier lives more than older people do .but even though havign health problems or not having big dreams , older people can find good lives .
