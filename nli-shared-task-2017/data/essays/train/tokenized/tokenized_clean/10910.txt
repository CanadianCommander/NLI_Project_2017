the communitiy gives an environment that helps us to learn , grow and progress in life .therefore helping the community is an important responsibility of every citizen .however , we freqeuntly find young people of the current generation not giving enough time for the benefit of the community on account of varied reasons such as lack of availability of time , lack of awareness , etc .but , i feel that many young people do work for community service in some form .increased competition and complexity besiege the life and career of many young people of the current generation .young people are busy advancing their personal goals in life and seldom find time for community service .many-a-times lack of awareness about options available for community service in a area leads one to not give enough time for community service .we find numerous examples of people of such kind .however , to conclude that all young people do not give enough time to community service would not be appropriate .there are several organizations like the `` yuva  in mumbai which are channelizing the efforts of the young people interested in community service .the number , membership and work of such organizations is growing .also , there a lot of young graduates these days who choose community service as a career option even when they have to accept lower salaries .increase satisfaction serves as their prime motivation .besides , especially in india , i see a lot of people choosing civil service option with an objective of serving the society .thus , we see a mixed trend in the dedication of the young people of the current generation to their communities .on one hand , we find young people who are completely selfish and do not care about community , while on the other hand we find those that dedicate themselves for community service .most of the people stand some where in between .on the whole , i find that the awareness about , interest in , and efforts towards community service are increasing .
