can we state that success is directly connected to innovation , that the more you are taking risks , the better your chances of success will be ?this may seem a pretty obvious statement at first .i am going to invent a new product and i will become rich !but this statement may be more complicated than it appears .let start with the `` obvious  part .of course , by introducing a new product on a market , i increase my chances to attract customers and develop a successful business .our world is constantly evolving and new products , new technology for example , are very much on demand .i can also , by trying differents ideas or methods , improve the way i am doing my business and become more efficient .new ideas can improve the quality of my products , their cost efficiency , their image .companies all around the world know that very well and urge their employees to think `` outside the box  .universities will also motivate their students to become more creative and find new ways of thinking .it seems that everyone agrees that creativity and innovation are very important to become successful .but i ca nt help remembering that van gogh never sold one painting during his entire life .he was one of the most creative and innovative painters of his time .he dedicated his life to his art and painted the way he wanted even if he was heavily criticized .why was nt he successful ?i ca nt also help noticing that every time i go to the cinema to see one of the `` big success of the year  , i am disappointed .it seems that to be successful , a film has to follow a set of standard rules : a charismatic hero , a sexy counterpart , lots of action and simplistic dialogs .obviously , creativity does nt pay in the movie business and you have to stick to what you do well , hence rocky v and all the sequels of successful films that are shot every year .i certainly do think that creativity is a major asset and i encourage everybody around me to take risks in their life but i am not convinced that it leads to success .at least , not to success as we understand it , that is commercial success .but , it certainly leads to personal improvement , to a sense of satisfaction and achievement that the repetition of an activity can , at one point , no longer bring .
