i am agree with the given statement .according to day to day experience as a student i can say , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .firstly , lets elaborate it by citing an example .in maths subject there are few facts , based on which a student has to do sum .but is that possible that only by learning the facts the student will be able to solve a given sum .untill a student donot understand the concept of solving proper type of sum , he will stuck up with the sum .by only learning maths facts student will be able to solve only a particular type of sum .if he has not understood the concept of solving it , he will not be able to solve the same kind of sum if the sum is slightly twisted .secondly , if a student doesnot understand any subject and just mug up the facts of the subject , he will not be able to retain it for long .it is a proved fact , that the things which are understood are more retentive than the things which are just mugged up .by understanding any topic of a subject a student can use it more practically .thirdly , lets consider medical students .if a medical student just learn the facts about human body and donot understand it , he can do big mistakes and it will be a question of life and death .if he has not understood human body and just learned the facts , whenever he will find a slightly differnt disease , he will not be able to prescribe any medicine .because he might couldnot have learnt the desease exactly the same way .but by understanding he can make out that it is just a slight different menefestation of the same desease .thus in the light of above mentioned examples it can be safely said that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
