the statement in the title points out an important issue in education : is it more urgent to memorize information or to develop transversal capabilities ?of course students need to learn facts .how could i understand the history of my country without knowing what has happened in the last centuries ?further , if we did nt study the biographic facts of an author , then we would lose important information that might have been useful in order to get the meaning of his poetry .in my experience , it is useful to know and display some knowledge also when i have to support an opinion , since my ideas become more concrete and persuasive .considering these advantages , traditional school used to stress the mnemonic side of learning , creating well prepared students .on the other hand , these students could be a bit rigid .for instance , my italian teacher at highschool did nt accept any alternative way of presenting the contents and she expected us to memorize pages and pages , without asking for any critical development .the result is that i forgot the most part of the literature i studied in those year , which is a real shame !while traditional school used to put too much emphasis on learning facts , modern teachers , on the contrary , try to focus on concepts rather than on mere facts .a deep understanding of the key ideas of an author , for instance , implies a double advantage .on one hand it is easier to remember something that you have thought about : my english teacher , for instance , used to ask for our opinions regarding an author s ideas and she even tried to make sense of phrasal verbs , in order to let us memorize them !on the other hand , when you become familiar with ideas and concepts , you are likely to improve your capability of thinking with your mind .since in my opinion this is the first aim of school , far beyond a mere transmission of contents that could be forgotten very easily , i agree with the statement in the title .
