i totally agree with the statement that having a knowledge on many subjects is better than specializing on one subject .the world now is growing fast and the diversity in all fields is maximizing .in such a new and modern world specializing in one subject can be challenging .fields which have once been thought to be in isolation or independent are now requring support from other fields .this interdependency has given raise to more sophisticated companies which require people with a minimum knowledge in many important fields .this has a lot of applications .a multi national company ( mnc ) is the best example of a place which require people having knowledge in many fields .in an mnc there are various levels of work .let us take an example of a human resource manager .his work is to employ new people suitable to the firm , monitor the progress of projects and constantly deal with economic issues of his form .the above three tasks require aplication in various fiellds like to employ new people he must first basically understand the needs of his firm .this requires him to have a knowledge in the field of firm bussiness requirements .next to monitor a project he should know the platform on which the project is being built .for this he needs to have some skill in the computer languages .next to deal with the economic issues of the firm he must atleast know the basics of the laws of bussiness running .thus a level-3 worker like a hr manager requires a knowledge on three totally diverse fields .if this is the case with a hr manager then we can easilly understand the requirements a ceo needs .even scientists need a knowledge on many different fileds other than thier own subject .for example a physics scientist needs to know mathematics for calculation in physics .he needs to have grip on topics like trignometry , calculus etc which are essential for solving complex relationships in fields like dynamics , solid state physics etc .the computer which can be called as the new face of the world changed a lot of approaches in many fields .it is being used in fields like astronomy , physics chemistry in many ways like embedded systems .a space research scientist , launching a rocket needs to calculate the astronomical distance between the earth and the target .this if done with help of a cmputer needs him to understand how to use the system and other such complexities .e ven the present educational system seems to have accepted the need of having basic information in many fields .the schools of the presemt day have many subjects lke maths , science , social , languages etc .the students ought to take all these subjects atleast till a certain grade and then opt for subjects they are interested in .the courses in collges also have many subjects in the courses which they feel are needed .for example in engineering all the students also have common subjects in the area of computers , electronics etc .thus in view of the new world i feel a knowledge in a many subjects is needed for achieving success .a specialization in a single area has no great use today .
