we are in the xxi century and now i must write about the most advertisements that make products seem much better than they rally are .i agree whit this idea because often many products that the people watch on tv or see around them , do not appear what they really are .in fact i thinck that the television introduces different ideas in the head of people .for example some people buy only shoes or the dress or gadgets that are sign by important many people do not know what is the true , because some products are good and have hight qualty .we can value these products for the material they are build , for their aspect , for their end .the apparence is most important but i thinck that is not the most important element of vatulation , but for many people it is the only element of confronte some objects .this idea is rediculeus because the apparence is not all in the life of the people .for example , i am an architect , when i make a proget for a house i thinck that this house must be confortable , beautiful , faschion , and help the people in the life .it must be the hause of live not only a beautiful house .by the way many people do not understand that a house or another kinds of products are good when each elements that compose the product must be in the sit good .
