in this morern , people are easily find the advertisements , they take place everywhere .peolpe can find the advertisements not only in the tv , but also in the newspapers .furthermore , people buy many things because of the advertisements .the advertisements always look really good and make people want to spend money on them .in my opinion , i think that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the reasons are the owners want to earn money , and the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated .first reason is because the owners want to earn mony from these commondities .for instance , if the asvertisements look really terrible , no one would desirable to buy them and spend their money on them .therefore , the owners wo nt get the money and welfare from them .secondly , most of the advertisements are decorated and exaggerated .for example , the ipod is really fasional these days .the advertisements of ipod allways says that it can contain over 1,000 songs and wo nt out of batteries at least 14 hours .however , after i spend my money that come from my salary of part time job , i was really sad about that .my ipod ran out of batteries before 8 hours , and it had no more space before i put in the three hundred and fifty-third song .therefore , i stronging believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following reasons .the owner want to earn money and the advertisements are allways decorated and exaggerated .
