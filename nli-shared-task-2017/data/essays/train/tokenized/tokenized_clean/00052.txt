one of the most contraversial and hot topic that has been discussed for a long time is that whether an advertisement can change the image of the product in a better way than the product actually is .in spite of the fact that some people think the product is what it is and nothing can change the quality of it , advertisement is a very effective way to better the product in advance .the way the product is advertised has a vital importance .it can show the product much better by using couple of elements .undoubltly , advertisement helps to show a product much better that it actually is only if the advertisement is good .however , what can be supposed as a good ?what is the qualities of good ?to be able to answer those questions we need to be really very careful about the strategies we use in the advertisement .the new technologhy enables us to do millions of things with the cameras .the colors on the products might be shown much more brighter as it is or the little deficiencies might be hidden when it is advertised .besides that the language that is used in the advertisement is very important too .the words and the tonation must be appropriate to the product that is getting advertised .for example , in a drink advertisement , a man is getting really thirsty after sport and he is drinking his drink .the sound that he is making when he takes a sip from the bottle and after he is done the way he talks or stands - feeling of relief - makes a big difference .however , a person who drinks it may still feel like he is pretty thirsty .with advertisements , product can be exxagarated greatly .this is actually what a lot of advertisements do .they show the product in a superior way like `` if you wear this shoes , you will fly .this technique actually works pretty good .eventhough it can help to make the product seem better , once people buy it , they sue the company right away .as a result , since in todays modern world , there are great ways in the advertisement area , the products can be shown much more different that it is .technology and the way of language helps to exxagarate the product and it affects people s physchology .eventhough they feel bad and disappointed after they purchase the product , it definitiely helps to show the product better .
