younger and older people have differnt ways to live their lifes but it seems to me that younger people can enjoy their way of living more than older people can .that is why i agree with the the statment .on reason is , that i think that young people are more unconscious than older peolpe and that is why they are more free in taking advantage of what is going on in front of them .for example if hey have the opportunity to go and visit a friend in another country they often do not thing how hard it is to go there .they just take a few things and try to reach their friends place , maybe by hitch hiking .this mostly differes from the behaviour of older people , which often have to plan things in a really organized way .and often have all this thouhgts like is this the right moment in my life , what about my job . ..this feels like , that young people have a big amount of freedom to act however they want a other reason why young people can enjoy their lifes more is , that they do not have the same amount of responsibillities like older people .they do not have children to look for .they can go to a party the whole night long without having lots of stress the next day .they only need to go to school .young people often are more healthy then older peoples , so they can do a lot of things older people can not do , for example extrem - sports according to all the other reasonable things about this topic i would think , that the main point why young peoples enjoy life betteris , that they still have freedom to choose what they want to do , without beeing trapped in an adult life .
