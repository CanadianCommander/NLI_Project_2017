nowadays young people have nt time to hep their communities .i think that this statement is true .nowadays the interesting of young people are different to doing help for their community .there are a lot of reasons because it happens :1 ) young people do nt receve an aduguatly educations by own parents : i think that the parents should do an adeguatly education about helping the community , because so they do nt only play with their friends , and because it is another way to stay with other young people .2 ) they think only for theirself , to buy new dress , to play football ,and other activities that give more importance to own personality .3 )they think that other persons can help their communities , and so they ca nt do nothing for their communities .they do their help only if someone tell they what they do .when i was young i helped my community when i had some time : so i went to a social place where live some small children who have nt their parents and i played with they ; or with other friend and parents we cleaned my city to some rifiutes that other bad people put on the street or in the park .this are only some example that all young peolpe can do to help the community : it does nt take a lot of time .only person can do a little actions to help the community , because the community is formed also by we and because the help that we do now , tomorrow someone will do it for we .
