being a successful person is an undefined problem .in order to answer this problem we should clearly define what we mean by being a successful person .if being succesful is defined as learning and experiencing new things one might be right by saying this sentence .but in my opinion being successful is doing what you already know perfectly .success is the measure of how well you have done a job or a work .it is clear that by learning so much new thing and having new experiences does not allow you to do your job or work perfectly .a person s target should be doing the job or work which he/she specialised in .so , trying new things , ideas or taking risks wo nt allow you to focus on your target .it is obvious that learning new things , cooperating with the new developments and having some informations about the topics which you have nt known how to do well is not bad at all .it has important advantages for people .for instance , think about an engineer .he designed a really functional device for listening music .but he has to sell this product in order to earn money from his design .and in order to make money he has to know how to negotiate with people .it is not a right behaviour to say that negotiation is an business man s job , i do nt have to negotiate with people .instead of being a man who know nothing about everytthign i choose to know everything about
