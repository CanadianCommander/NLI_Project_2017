today , cars are an important object of our life , it has become one of the bases of our life and a great means of transportation .it is also a symbol of freedom and independance for both young and older people .but with the progressive disparition of crude oil , we could wonder how it will be in 20 years .to answer this question , i will see in a first part that there are no signs showing a decrease of cars in use and in a second part that there will even be an increase of cars in use but different cars .fisrt of all , i do nt think that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years , i mean 20 years , it is nearly tomorrow ; the situation can not change so fast .nowaday , we are in a mass consumption society , which consommates a lot of all materials objects and especially cars .a statistic have be done and shows that cars are not a familiiy object anymore but are now an individual good , so it proves the increase of cars bought .moreover , in 20 years there wo nt be other means of transportation as developped as the car is nowaday .there will be new cars but still at their bgin .today the scientistic research can not propose a means of replacement to the car .at the contrary , i think that the number of cars in use will still increase for some decades , but it wo nt be the same cars that we have today .everybody knows that there are less and less oil in the reserves , that pits are going to be empty in some decades and that the price of crude oil is always and steadily increasing .but all this facts do nt mean the end , the death of cars .it only shows that we need new sources of energies and new ressources , such as water , sun , vegetal elements .we are only mooving to a new type of car , a new age .today , there are already test which are made for new cars but it is not developped enougn to be sell and use .there are some prototypes of cars using water as energies but it is still a begin .to sum up , i do nt agree with this statememt ; at the contrary , i think that there will be more cars in 20 years that there are today .there will certainly be less cars using crude oil but more and more cars using new energies
