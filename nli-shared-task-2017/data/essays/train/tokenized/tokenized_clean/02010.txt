people often can not come to the agreement even in the trivial issues that it is better or not to have broad knowledge of many subjects .it is a little bit haste to say having broad knowledge have more benefits , and vice versa .with the rapid development of academic subjects , the increasing number of subjects are difficult to understand deeply .however , people s abilities is limited and no time to study in many subject .face to the problems , you can not only use one specific subject to solve them .you have to teach yourself and learn from other people in many academic subjects .it also could broaden you horizon and accumulate all kinds of knowledge to deal with these problems .another benifit is give you many chance to challege yourself and dig up your real interests .furter-more , beacuse of the intension to broaden your knowledge of many academic subjects , you will ask others more and have more harmonious relationships .but the problem may be more and more difficult , thus one people could not deal with alone .that need someone have a deep understanding in one specific subjet .without the abilities , the problem could face to but could not to solve it .therefore , the saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is mainly depand on the circumstances .according to my current situation , i prefer to study broad academic subjects .thus i could monmunicate a lot to other people and broaden my horizon .when i found my real interest of subjects , i will pay much time on the specific subject , due to the interest is the best teacher , and then i will have the deep understanding of the specific subject .thus i think it is suitable for me .
