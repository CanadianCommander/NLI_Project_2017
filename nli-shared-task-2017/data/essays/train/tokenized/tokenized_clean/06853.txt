it has been said that knowledge and free thinking form the basis of any successful society .the maxim completely describes todays world which has seen a tremendous desire to achieve milestones previously unimaginable .for any society to grow we require an understanding of previous knowledge and also an account of our past achievements .but would it not cause stagnation if the sole purpose of learners was to be aware of these facts and learn them ?progress can only be made if we analize our past and learn from them .analizing can only come through a proper understanding of ideas and concepts .luckily throughout history we have seen mavericks , be it galileo or newton or even someone as recent as einstein , who went against the tide to come up with ideas that allowed the next generations to flourish .were it not for our unending thirst for knowledge we would still be living in the stone age .this is self evident fron the way kids grow and learn from their surroundings .a baby may never learn how to walk or talk if its brain did not possess the ability to grasps the required steps involved in this complex process .in this case it may be understanding subconsciously but if we want a robot to simulate the actions of a child we would first require a complete understanding of the involved steps .only after this can we put newer ideas into making machine emulate man .as students it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts during our college years .this is the time when we not only learn new things but also contribute to the society as a whole .be it in any field ; even activities like dancing and singing have evolved over time due to our constantly changing approaches .our world today is a technological world and needs constant changes owing to the ever increasing demands .computers are becoming increasingly comlpex and faster at the same time .the computer was invented because of someones tremendous visions but little would he have realized its sinificance in todays world .we students are the new work force of the future and are aware of the needs of todays world .despite all the progress we have made we suffer from difficulties in all countries rich or poor .our understanding of the world , its people and the interrelations have just evloved .yes we do require facts to account for the details and observations we have made .but it would serve no purpose if it is not backed up with proper interpretaion and newer ideas to better our future .our future , thus , depends on how well we understand ideas and concepts and come out with newer ones .
