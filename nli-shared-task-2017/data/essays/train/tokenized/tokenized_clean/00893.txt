i agree with the statement that successful people try new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .in today s changing and competitive world , people who are not willing to try new innovative things will get left behind .i cite the example of microsoft corporation as a company that has thrived because they were willing to take risks .they took a contract to develop an operating system for ibm even when they had no product in hand .after signing the contract , they found the appropriate piece of software called dos , and developed it sufficiently to meet all the contract requrements of ibm .if they had not taken that risk , who knows where that company would have been today .they contrinued to take enormous monetary and other risks to develop all their subsequent products , especially ms word , even when other word processing products like word perfect were more popular at the time .by showing a desire to change and try new methods , microsoft has reached the pinnacle of its glory in the pc business .my personal experience in the field of engineering has led me to similar conclusions .our company stayed around 60 employees and grew at a 2-3 % growth rate for the 1st 35 years of existence .however , the advent of another ceo changed the fortunes of the company .after about 10 years since he took over , we now have about 400 employees and have more than quadrupled our revenue .this happened because the new ceo expanded the business into other areas deemed risky like telecommunication , water resources and control solutions .he even opened a `` build  component to the original `` design  organization , which was very risky because of many unknowns .the `` build  component of the company proved to be the biggest revenue grosser at the company .hence , because of the two examples provided above , i am convinced that most successful people try new things instead of just doing things they already know .they may not always succeed , but as the saying goes , bigger the risk , bigger the benefit .
