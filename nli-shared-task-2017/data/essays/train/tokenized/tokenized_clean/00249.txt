although it may seem like young people do not contribute to the development of their society as much as in the old days , i strongly believe the opposite .in my opinion , daily life and social issues have become so interrelated that it is difficult to distincly see the youth s contribution to his/her society .consequently , youngsters help their communities in the form of joining social affiliations , taking active role in political discussions and even working while they take part in educational activities .one way that youngsters contribute to the well-being of their society is through community work they do in their free time .it is possible to see many university students voluntarily participating in clubs where they have the opportunity to help children , people with disabilities and people who are in need .another solid example of youth s contribution to the society is their desire in expressing their political opinions and taking the necessary action .in my opinion , a strong society is the one in which politics can exceed the walls of the parliement .in the country where i live , young people form active groups to contribute to the well-being of their country .thus , their contribution can not be neglected .finally , it is not so difficult to come across university even high school students working on part-time jobs .to be more specific , half of my friends are both working and studying .considering the time they need to allocate for their studies , working while studying is not an easy task at all .thus , it should deserve the society s appreciation .by doing so , the youth makes a significant contribution to the economy of their community .there are various examples suggesting that the youth is still actively helping their community .thus , it would be wrong to thing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is just that they do it in a different manner than the usual .
