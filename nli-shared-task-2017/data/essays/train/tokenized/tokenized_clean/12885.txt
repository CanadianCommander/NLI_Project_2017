we can assume when we read this that it would be right to say that young people enjiy more life than older but how can we be sure of this ?when we are young we do lots of things : like to party see our friends , go abroad , but we do nt enjoy more life , no ?for exemple young people can be born very quickely and often do not take time to do things , or spend most of their time watching television , or on internet .and sometimes are not aware of the chance they have to be young and to do lots of things .some people always wants more and more , the more they have the less happy they are .at the contrary older poeple are knozn to have the notion of what life really is and know that time is precisous .we can see that in general older people schedule all their time and are really organized .the older people get the less they want to loose time , they want their life to be like a calendar .we wish we can suppose so that they enjoy life too but in differents ways but we can not be sure that they enjoy life as much as young people .what is nice when you are young is that you only think of what you do at the moment and not of teh consequences you are often less responsable , so have more fun .we can see that in discos for exemple or during vacations .to conclude we can assume that young people do not enjoy life more then older people but in a different way .
