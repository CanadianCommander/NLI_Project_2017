there are plenty of cases worldwide of people becoming successful without trying new things , but focusing and putting the whole efforts over specific and alligned tasks , instead of taking the risk of developing new things .lets just consider a couple of examples to illustrate my statement , the first one is over a well known name on the computer history , bill gates .mr. gates has always been working on computers since the very beggining , developing a new system that allows computers to be `` friendly  to the common user , produced and distributed by the microsoft company .in this sense , the products coming out from microsoft has always been in the same line , avoiding the consumer to get into complex structures to undertand how interact with the computer .another example comes out from a totally diferent field as is the one of finance .mr. george soros is a british man that has been involved in finance transaction for a very long time , and getting profits out of it without taking the risk of expanding the investments into different sectors , further that the capital markets .these two examples does not mean that a person taking the risk of doing new thing can not become succesful , but shown a clear image that the path to success can be follow by just one line of risks , or if i may say so , by one line of ideas .other example includes the music industry , where it is easy to find singers and groups with just one musical hit , that launched them up to the hall of fame .this is the case , for instance , of rem .this group goes directly into the music history records with only a few songs recorded some years ago , but still on top of the billboards worldwide and even considered as major clasics fot the real fans .the fact that this groups has never change the style , nor even the field of work , can be considered as another example of avoiding new risk and tasting the good flavor of success , in this particular case , for a very long time .
