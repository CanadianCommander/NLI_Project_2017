i strongly agree on the statement that young people are enjoying there life than older once .as per the changing of the time the people have to change .in the older days there were be certain restrictions given to stop things tobe done which give lot of happiness .consider the situation of my parents .they have certain to point out , many restrictions over there life s .the education what my grandfather insist to study , my father continued .but it is different in my condition , i have my own views to which i can and i do probably .in the same way many cases , consider another example in which older peole are not that much free to their children , as the thing they missed lot of things to share to their parents for example some college situations .but the children now are enjoying each and every moment of their college life with their co-students and sharing the things to parents and commenting .and the other more is improvement of technology .in olden days there were not any amusement parks , recreation clubs , theatres and stuff like that .but the improvement of technology gave lot of fun over life .the younger people are able to enjoy themselves by going to parks , recreation clubs , parties along with friends and tours .and the tours will give lot of fun along with the information about the places where people are going .in this way i can give the examples like this to tell many things and the young people are having the ability to do there things of their own with fun , but previously people have to depend on some one to complete any work which they want to do .so i strongly agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
