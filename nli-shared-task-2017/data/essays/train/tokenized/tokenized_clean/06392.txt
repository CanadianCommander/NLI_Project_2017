in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .that was in my openian .i have some reasens for that .the first reason , before more than twenty years ago there are cars and dont find other to transfer our from one place to other in the same city .so the cars become mare and more from the bast .in fact , there are other equpmet to transfer our from one plase to other in other city , for example there are trains , planes and subways , that was faster from cars but still the cars are the importnat .in other hand to supose my openion the goverment make more fasilities for the rode and more safety , for exampel , i prefer the travel by car because it is com fortable for me , i can find the resturants in the rode and rest areas .so i stop to take relax in the time that i feel tired , but when i travel on the plane or tain i can not stop to take relax .there are othor reason , when i travel by car i see the diferent viwes and i learn my children about it , and we can viset more cities on the rode before i reach the place that i want .in sumary the cars are the most spesilaties for the families , we can not fewer cars untile find the other have all advantages .
