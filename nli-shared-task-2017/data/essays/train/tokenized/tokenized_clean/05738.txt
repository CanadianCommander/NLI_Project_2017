it is difficulf to make a certain prediction about this topic , because in one hand taking care of the enviroment is becoming more and more important nowadays and on the other hand technology is definately part of our life .anyway , i believe that in twenty years they wo nt be fewer cars than there are today because modern life moves fast , communications are very important and there are new , ecologic energies that can avoid car pollution .modern life moves fast , specially in big cities .people in big cities work very hard and work many hours .for that reason these workers really appreciate their free time and want to be able to move fast to enjoy it .nowadays public mains of transport are not as usefull and efficient as having an own car .having a car is not that expensive , so many peaople can afford having their own car .economy is growing a 3 per cent every year so hopefully in twenty years people will be able to by nicer cars , instead of having to take the subway or the bus .the globalization movement has made the communications very important .it is true that others mains of tansport may be developed , but having an own car allows citizens to go wherever they want whenerver they want .globalization is called to become more and more powerfull , that s why i believe that people will like having their own car in twenty years .one of the main problems about cars is that they damage the enviroment .anyway , countries are spending a lot of money in investigating in renewable energies that do not damage the enviroment .that will allow the car industry to use these new source of energy to car construction .hopefully , in twenty years cars will be respectfull with the enviroment , so people wo nt mind driving their own car .as a conclusion , in my opinion in tewnty years there will be as many cars as nowadays because of the necessities and characteristics of modern life .
