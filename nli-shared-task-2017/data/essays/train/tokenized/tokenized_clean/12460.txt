that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a quite intersing question , in fact it is related to intrinsic human attitude .all the humans wants to be successful people , but really it is always necessary to innovate things of to risks the life or something to have success in life ?why i can not be simple myself doing the things that i know to do , ever in the same way , and become a successful people as well ?probably some example could help us in aswering to this questions .in human history there are many example of people who become successful only because they tried new things and took risks .think about cristoforo colombo , he was the first sailor to have the idea to go to india by the sea insted that by land .he decided to try a new thing and he become very successful , in fact he discovered america .naturally he takes a lot of risks for his own life in doing that .in the very recent history we have the example of bill gates who become a successful people , the richest man of the world , doing something that no man have never do before .he invents computers and he invested all his life and all the money that he had at that time in founding his company , microsoft .so he decided to take the economical risks .however we have also to consider that not alla the people who try new things and take risks are successful people , in fact in choosing this way it is common to fail .for example many people died in the tentative of beeing the first man who fly from america to europe .in my opinion , as the above exemples shows , you can not be a successful people just doing what you already know how to do well , without taking any risk .in this way you probably can become a respectable worker or perhaps an affidable person , by i think this is not the definition of `` successful people  in which most people are interest .
