we all have been in traffic jams and mostly it is due to the fact that the number of cars increased a lot recently , rather than that it is because of roads .due to the imporevements in manufacturing technologies , it has become possible to produce cheap cars in shorter times .in return , the number of cars increased .toyota now can produce a car in 2 minutes with a cost of 2000 dollars , less or more , of course depending on the type of the car .this indicates that as technology developes more and more , people will buy more and more cars .so in the following 20 years , in my opinion , there will be more cars instead of the possibility that there will be fewer cars been driven than we drive today .one reason for the possible increase in number of cars within close future is , as aforementioned , the technological improvements enable manufacturers to produce cheaper cars in shorter times .cheaper cars mean that almost everybody can have it .attracted by extra promotions and suitable purchasing conditionos , even a family can have more than one car .and this attraction that the manufacturers present for their customers will be even more attractive as technology contunies to improve , as a result ; more automobiles will be on the roads .other than that cars are getting cheaper , the people are getting richer as well .the economies of countries grow with the impact of globalization , especially in develop and developing countries , which in turn brings money to people , and i can say that the globalization is just starting .so what can be done with the money ?of course if you have a house , you will buy a car ; if you have a car why should not your wife or son have a car next .it can be seen that having automobile is not accepted as luxury property in some countries , especially in develloped ones .and considering the population of develoding countries and they are going to be developed , there will be a significant incline in the numbers of cars .also there can be disadvantages of driving a car in the next coming 20 years .the time consumed in traffic jams , and environmental problems related to pollution can disatract people , or even laws can be decided by goverments that are limitating automobile usage or number of cars in a family .but all these will not stop the increase in the number of cars , at least 20 years .to conclude , it can be said that cars are getting cheaper and people are gettin richer in the follawing 20 years due to technologicalso the world is going to be wealthier and cars , of course , are the best canditates to show the wealth a person have .therefore , i believe that number of cars will increase .
