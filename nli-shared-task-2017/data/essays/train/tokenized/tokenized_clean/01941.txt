helping the comunity you live in , does not necessarily mean to allot more time helping the older people or reading to blind .there are also indirect ways that young people will contribute their comunity to foster .these indirect ways may seem inmeasurable in the first place , but actualy are more contributing than any other means of direct help .young people spend most of their time for doing popular things such as dancing , singing even playing video games .but popular things arouse intrest of the comunity which makes them profitable for the mass media .and therefore singing .dancing and even video game contest are shown on tvs .this contest enables young people to become a celebrity only by exceling in the popular things that they like .celerities bring many contributions to where they live .people visit the places where a famous celebrity is born .in turn of this touristic attraction the local economy will boost and bring new job opportunities to the community .moreover spending more time for individual development rather than for social contributuions to the community will enable young people to become more capable and respected individuals in the future .if young people direct their energy for intellectual excellence they will cultivate a better future for both them selves and the comunity they live in .the contributiuon a young may do is very limited when compared to a rich , respected and powerful person can do who is willing to help his society .to sum up , young people should their best to become someone in the first place so that they will also help their community .
