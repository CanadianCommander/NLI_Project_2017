i disagree with the statement that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .nowadays people are realising the benefits that the automobiles provide to people .its more convienient to travel by a car than by other means of transport as cars provide us with a sort of freedom that we do nt get from other maens of transport and since the economy is improving more and more people can afford to buy cars .this will lead to an increase in the number of cars in the near future as m nowdays the automobile companies provide variety of comforts with the car and hence make travelling more fun in the car .and thse comforts will only increase as the time goes on .the safety standards of the car is also being steadily improved upon thus making a car journey much more safer .the safety standars can only improve with time thus making cars much more safer than other means of transport .moreover it is easier to buy a car nowdays with the reduction in prices and the variety which is available .and a few year from now we will see more variety thus prompting people to discard their old cars and buy a new one .also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoyment one gets while driving a car .this will never go away and will make people buy cars .then their is the reason of economic superiority that we humans tend to show which make people buy many cars .thus all these reasons suggest that their will never be a reduction in the demands of car and hence we will see more and more cars on the roads few years from now .
