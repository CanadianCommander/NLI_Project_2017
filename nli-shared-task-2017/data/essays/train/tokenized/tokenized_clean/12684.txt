i stronly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my point of view that , on the contrast , older people could face their life in a posituve way and do some valuable things that they want to and they have not a demanding attidute toward others .older people , therefore , i think would enjoy life more than young people .at the first place , older people have enough time to travel and see the world .i , myself , am a local english tour guide in beijing , my hometown , as a part-time job .most of the tourists i took were the eld people from australia .the most situation for them were they had travelled many places in the world after they got retired and they told me the stories about their travelling .when they were telling those stories , what i saw from theri face was the happiness they got from travelling .seconly , they , the older people , could face their life in a positive way by which they enjoy themself very much .most of old couples i took were this sort of people .it is commen things for them to pick trash up on the ground while the young people around were just past by or kicked it off .i remember that an old man who got a band back persist to climb up to the top of the great wall without any help , such cable car .i was told by him that this was part of my life and i enjoyed it very much .on the other hand , most of the young people in my life including my can not enjoy our life by traveling .first , we do nt have that much of money to support the travelling ; second , the most important thing for us is study .besides , young people have nt not that much life experience which might lead they see things in a negative way .take a freshmen in my college this year for example .this student , who majoys in spanish , jumped themself from the forth foor just for a n unbeliveable reason that she could not pronause the spanish sound extactly .to sum up it , i do not agree that statemant of young people enjoy life more than older people do .i do think that it is old peopel who have much life experience to enjoy .
