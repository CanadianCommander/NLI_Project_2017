i agree that most of the time advertisements make products seem better than they are and i guess there are several reasons for this .one of the main reasons is that in most cases , there are a number of similar products manifactured by different companies that are in competition for being bought by costumers .usually costumers will want to choose the best product among the several similar ones , that is why each brand will try to convince potential buyers that his product is better than the others .for example , soaps and detergents to use in a washing machine .every advertisement will show extremely dirty clothes become spotless and the more incredible the result is , the better the product is supposed to be .the point here is `` incredible  : no product can actually do what is showed , but if company a did a sincere advertisement , nobody would buy a s product because `` it does not clean clothes as good as the others do  .that all comes down to a sort of `` prisoner s dilemma  from game theory .it is a bit like doping in some sports : if nobody used it , there would be a fair competition , but a single person who chooses not to use it puts itself at a great disadvantage towards the others .one other big reason for making products seem better than they are , is the need to create a desire in the potential costumer .the advertisement s goal is to make people feel that a certain item is so good and useful that it is not possible to live without it .so , even if at first people would think of that object as unnecessary , after some time they will feel the need to buy it .an example might be cell phones : until ten or fifteen years ago very few people had a cell phone and the ones who did not , did not even think about buying one because it would have been useless .now almost everybody has a cell phone , or even more than one , and they wonder how they did manage to live their lives without it .
