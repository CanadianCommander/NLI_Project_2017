everyone in the world wishes to have a car .so will the cars be less after twenty years from now ? .well in my opinion i do nt think that the number of cars will be less .because people need cars to travel , to work , visit there family or friends , use it as a home if it was a van and it is cheap compear to the other transports .so i dissagree for several reasons :firstly no one in the world has the ability to o to there work using there legs every morning in there life .because if that happens everyone will be tired at work and suffuring of legs pain .and that means people will preser to stay at home .another reason is that as a buisness person for sure cars will be there best way to let the way of the buisness go well .for example when i was in the city of my country .the main thing to travel is to use a car rather than walking .and if the roud is closed just for one hour that means that the buisness will stop or atleast the market will be low .second comes that cars nowdays are at everywhere in the world .so how it will be fewer than it is now ? .i do nt think that it will be easy to distroy the cars and find a place to burry them under the earth .however , most of the people need cars ( vans ) to use them as their home .that will be a travel home .they can take their home when ever they need to do that .at the end as an ower of as car i hardly beleive that cars will not be fewer in future unless there is a another wirld to throw all the cars in is .
