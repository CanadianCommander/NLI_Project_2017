although some people believe that it is crucial to learn the facts about anything than to understand the ideas and concepts , i consider learning and understanding ideas and consepts most benificial first of all you should have clear idea about what one wants to learn .just learning the facts will not any one .just take an example of a child when he starts learning his fist abc s or when he is starting to learn his additions .we can teach him 2 + 2 = 4 but he will want to know why he has to do that .if instead of that we teach him what is addition and why it is important --- like say he can get toys from right hand and left hand together , he would understand and will want to learn the facts too .facts can be memorised from the textbook , but if you do not understand the concept then it is very difficult to recollect the fact .in a test if your ideas are clear it does not matter if the facts are omitted you can still answer the question .where i grew up facts were given more importance .but when i started working i realized for me to grasp the vast knowledge needed i should have clear concept and ideas before i could produce a gexcellent report thus i think it is most important to have bett
