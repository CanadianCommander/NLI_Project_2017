i believe espeacially collage students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .for example in my university called sabanci university , we have two years to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .no matter which faculty the student will continue with , all students should learn a bit from everything such as chemistry , biology , mathematics , politics , history  design ect .for example i made a good useage of this system , by learning what i really want to study .as for me , i would never choose visual communication and design department if there was no such a system .i have choosen this department by knowing what it includes , what the requirements are and for sure what pleases me more .by looking from this perspective , i think that to have broad knowledge helps to open peoples minds and create more well cultural backgrounded people .the more well cultural backgrounded people means the more civilized people .perhaps this would lead to a better , pieceful enviroment for living .by the help of this system , people take more confidential steps to their future jobs .as we see today , most people do not work at the same field that they were graduaded from , moreover they do not enjoy their jobs .as a conclusion , this system can be the solution of this problem .however i believe that after having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people should specialize in one subject , because it is also important to have specialized people on specific subjects .if knowledge of everyone is on the same level , the scientific approaches or artistic innovations would not be possible .as a result of all , my oppinion is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
