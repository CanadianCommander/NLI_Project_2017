as in all areas , there are many disagreements on education approach .regarding teaching methods , some believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .both teaching methods are highly used in all over the world , but when it comes to my teaching method , i am a clear defender that it is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn plain and simple facts .it dose nt require any type of creativity for a student to understand a fact .facts are facts .facts can not be developed nor changed .on the other hand , ideas and concepts require creativity and development .by teaching students to understand an idea , you are teaching him the why and how of the fact .you are fostering the student to think about it , analize it and reach his own conclusion - a conclusion that with time , will develop intake the example of a teacher who is trying to teach his student not to swear at other people .if he would tell him not to swear beacause swearing is against the kinder-garden rules and it sounds bad ( which are facts ) , the kid is most likely to stop swearing because those are the rules , he was told not to , not beacause he has understood the concept of morale , or because he regrets hurting people .if we teach him the idea , the concept about swearing and all its consequenses ( which are such and such ) , the kid can truly understand why not to swear .by teaching our students the idea and the concepts behind the facts that control our lives , we are encouraging our students to become flexible , analize and have a mind of their own .we are forstering students who do not only know the facts , but also know the why and the how of facts .david zuniga leyton
