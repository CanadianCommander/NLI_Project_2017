as time goes on , there occur technological developments that make our lifes easier .all of these technological developments provide us a more efficient time usage .car was the most important technological development that have ever been made up to now .however , today we faced with some problems in the usage of cars .this problems made me think that in the following twenty years , there will be fewer cars in usage than there are todays .now , most of us are complaining about the time we spent in the traffic .this means that , this technological development `` car  does not provide us effective time usage now .then , we need a better technoloy than using cars as soon as possible which will decrase the usage of cars .as i mentioned above , one of the reason for the decrease in the number of cars can be the technological developments we will have in the following years .however , this can not be the only reason in the decrase of this number .the second reason can be that the decrasing energy supplies to work our cars .when the energy sources decraeses , the money that we have to pay for it increses .then , day by day , it is getting more difficult to pay this money to buy petrolium for driving our cars .this is the second supporting idea about why i think that the number of car usage will decrase .this are some reasons to explain why i think there will be fewer cars in usage in the following years .i hope the developments in technology provides us better ways to travel .
