everyone at a point of time is and was young .and a person who knows to appreciate the life can always learn and live life happily and enjoy every moment of it .i do not really agree that young people can enjoy life more than older people , as enjoying life is no way related to age .age can pass but enjoyment remains the same , for example it is not that only young people can eat ice cream and enjoy it , ice cream is noway related to age even older people can have it and yet enjoy the taste .the young people enjoy the life without thinking about any consequences , where as the older people grow wise and can analyse what is good and what can harm them .for instance nowadays young people take all kinds of drugs and say they are having fun , where as they are paving way to their own end , with this regard older people can atleast judge what will be fruitful for them .another good example of young people enjoying the life by performing daredevil stunts with thier vehicles , where as an older man will be cautious about himself and his dependants unlike the youn people .if it is about fitness where one can play games or do lot of sports activity then probably older people can also do it .for example take cricket , tennis , where people who have maintained their fitness all throughout their life have managed to play even in the later part of their live s and also won many titles and awards , such as s.graff who played her last match at age of 40 plus and yet won the title .i beleive enjoying life does nt really mean being reckless with life , taking drugs and going to prostitutes or indulging in unnecessary activities . .enjoying life means being happy , feel the happiness and make others happy , which will not only change you but but will bring a change in the society .where everyone can enjoy the life .
