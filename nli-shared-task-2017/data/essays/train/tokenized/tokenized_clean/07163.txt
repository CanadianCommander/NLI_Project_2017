i agree that successful people try new things and take risks ratherthan only doing what they already know how to do well .it s important for example for a business man who his successful tocontinue to be successful and to continue to increase hisbusinesses .firstly , a successful person is a person who never stop and alwaystry to do better than what he has done before .a successful person isgenerally an ambitious person , who has goals in his life , and it s this strong ambition that pushes him to achieve the limits , to try newthings and take risks , iven if that could causes problems to him andit s a difficult task .for example a successful builder entrepreneur normally will try toimprove his business .so , he will try to build new houses for exampleand sell them in order to have a gain , and he will risk his money ,because maybe there will be problems or he will not arrive to gainmoney . ..this person could do other kind of projets , with other people , and he will always take some risks , but he wants to continue to besuccessful and feel proud of his work .in contrast with successful people , other people feels comfortablewith what they already have and do nt take risks .secondly , other people do nt want to take risk .they know somethingto do well and have fear of the future , or are not enogh confident , and there is nt enogh ambition .to conclude , i agree with the statement presented on the questionfor the several reasons cited before .
