for the following reasons , i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first , using cars will be more convenient in twenty years .for example , when i was a university student at a hitotsubashi university in 1995 , i went to hokkaido , which has many natural parks in japan , by my friend ken s car .because the car had no car navigation systems , which showed the map where we were automatically , ken and i had a trouble to find the road we should go .however , now most cars in japan has car navigation systems .we come to know the road easily .although now we are not able to see the map about all over japan , in the twenty years we will be able to see it .using cars will be clearly more convenient in twenty years .second , a lot of more safety cars will be made in twenty years .for example , now in japan , where i live , there are more than ten thousand traffic accidents annually .last year , one of my cousins , kumiko , who was six years old , came across a traffic accident and because she ran into the road in order to catch a ball she dropped .the car driver , mr. suzuki was not able to stop immediately when he found her because it was suddenly .if the car coule have stopped automatically , he coule have avoid the accident .now i hear the news that car company are trying to make safety cars that can stop immediately when someone or something suddenly appear in front of the cars .i believe these cars will be made and used in twenty years because we will not have to be anxious about traffic accidents .a lot of more safety cars will be definitely made in twenty years .therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
