i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i believe that there is no requirement of an age for people to enjoy their life .i do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life , instead older people do too .those who support this statement would say that when people get old , their enthusiasm dies and due to old age health problems set in .but i would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves , your families , and our friends .it gives us the time to pursue our hobbies or passions which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money .we enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoyed our children .we have the time to take care of our health , which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work .we are more mature and more tolerant due to our experiences , and things do nt affect us as much as they did when we were not so understanding in our youth .we enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth .we have the time to go for holidays with family and see the world which we did nt see earlier due to lack of time .in youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of things which we can come back to later in our old age .in our youth , we are immature and things that we enjoy are more materialistic .whereas , in our old age , having known the world and become wiser we know that true happiness lies in being a good human and being content with what we have .old age brings with it , a lot of good things besides a few bad ones , of course .but being old does not mean that one can not enjoy it .there is rarely a time in your life when you are fully content with the way it is going and when all is actually well .it is all about the attitude that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one has .old people enjoy life as much , maybe more , than young people .
