i absolutely agree with this statement .to learn anything new , you have to know the idea of this thing .in other words , the learner must know the benfits fo this thing and why it is important to be known ? .in other things , the learner should have an idea of the history of what he learns .because if he knew its origin , he can decide how its importance as well as he will get a good comprehension of the thigs .after that , he can build the ideas which depend on the main idea .on the other side , if the students learn facts while they do not have a sufficient understood about the idea , they will misunderstand some of the backgrounds of the facts .and here are an example support my opinion .consider the concept of interrelationships between different community aspects that they may in some concerns be the eventual criteria of demonstrating what those ideas may have .
