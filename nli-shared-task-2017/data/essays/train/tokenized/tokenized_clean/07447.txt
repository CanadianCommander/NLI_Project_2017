nowadays , one of the most intriguing issues is that whether the majority of the advertisements makes their merchandise look much better than they really are .as far as i am concered , i agree with this opinion , with three follwing reasons .firstly , the advertisers attracts the public attentions by making full use use of the `` clarity effect  .although the cost on the super stars is always unbelievably high , the producers can also gain profit by the advertisement acted by the clarity .it is true that since the super movie star or singer appeared in the advertisement on the screen , people have memorized the product because of their favorable clarity and are probably buy the product .but unfortunately , the public know little about what they have bought .secondly , the advertiser aggrandizes the function of the products sometimes .for example , an advertisement mentions that you can keep all day long energitic by drinking an energy drink .in other words , you are still active even after you stay up for 24 hours .if so , why does the scientists always mention the importance of the 8 hours sleeping time ?lastly , the advertiser sometimes emphasize one its benefit of the product but deliberately ignore the negative effect .a brand of medicine to keep fit points out in its advertisements how much weight you can lose after a couple of weks .however , the medicine has a bad effect on the nerves of the takers to prohibit their desire to take food .all in all , most advertisements make their products seem much better than the originals .although it will add the profit for the producers , in the moral light , it is a deceving behavior for the public .
