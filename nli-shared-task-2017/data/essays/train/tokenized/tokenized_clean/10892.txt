when we are kids , we want to do all as we can when get into adults .i remember that i want to be a doctor , a spanish teacher , a clothes designer , and maybe a policeman .why i m bringing that memory ?because sometimes we have to be more like childrens .they just want to do all and i perfectlly agree with that because if we have the capacity for learn more , why we didnt ?i think that is much much better to have a broad knowledge of academnic subjects .in my personal experience when i went to high school i took a vocational course of food administration , preparation and service while in the afternoons i went to the school of music .that experience make a more independent human right now that i do nt live in my house .my plans in that moment were keep studying to become a chef but i abondon them because i decide to study music in a bachellor s degree .then when i start studying in the music conservatory i found a new thing : `` i can sing too  !the opera becomes for me a very important thing and that opens me the way to start dooing a minonor in voice .that thinge make me more sensitivity to music and helps improve my tuba performece till now .after that we realize that the conservatory gives a theather class for sinnger s , `` let s try it  i said .again a great experience came to my live and i become a better human with the disciplines of theather .any discipline that we can learn i think that helps for our lives .it s like have a tool box .you buy the tools and keep filling the box , in the way you have more tools you re gonna be better prepared .you re gonna have more live experiences .and that for me is the better that we can do .really , just the live knows what i m going to do in 20 years but , i sure that the all i m doing know are gonna help me forever .
