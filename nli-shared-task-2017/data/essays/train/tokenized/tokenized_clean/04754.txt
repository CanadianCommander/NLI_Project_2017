there is proverb ; knowledge is power .it means more knowledge brings more power .i strongly agree with that having broaden knowledge of many academic subjects is better .there are some reasons why having broaden knowledge of academic subjects are better because of application at other fields and various experience .first of all , by having different kinds of academic subjects , we can apply other different fields .for example , if construction company has plan to build new modern style building in city .in this case , first thing we can think about is company must need an architecturer , who builds building .if architecture has broaden knowledge of other academic subjects , then it would be better for making building .he can use various subjects such as art , math and geology in order to build a building .in addition , modern society needs people who are able to do multitaking job .moreover , having various academic subjects can make people have various experience .for instance , i am majoring business at school .i takes not only economy , which is my major subject , but also english , computer class , pyscology , and socialogy .in the future , i want to be a successful businessman , and succeful businessman needs various fields knowledge and experience .a busineesman needs interpersonal skill , resposibility , of course economic knowledge , and language .
