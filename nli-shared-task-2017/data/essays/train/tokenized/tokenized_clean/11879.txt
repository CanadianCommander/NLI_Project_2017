i totally agree with the statement , the best way to to have a nice travel is to go in a group and also to have a good tour guide .when we think about the possibility to do a travel we have to consider differents aspects one of those is the place where we want to go , also if it is good to be alone or in group and also , what we want to do on that place and how to do it .first , went we choose a place of dentination we have to consider aspects like the time that we have .when we do a travel in a group all the activities are very coordinated .the travel led by a tour are the best idea when you want to know a new place .the tour guide is the person specialides on this kind of jobs because they have the knowledge of the place that you want to visit , that have a clear understanding of the history of that place , also the right places to visit , what to eat and what to buy as a souvenir .they give a comprehensive tour for that place that you want to know completly .for example the last weekend i went to mexico with a goup of frients and we have just few days to enjoy the new country and also to have contact with the city and the people .so the best ideas was to take a tour by the city with a specilized person , the city was guanajuato , and this place of the country has a rich history to meet .that tourist guide really know about the city .he explained about the historica aspects of this city , we went to the target places to the city and also we took the most beautiful picture in the especial places , because of his orientation .it was an amazing travel , and we did that travel in just one day ; definilly to hire that person was the best ideas because in other way we could not see all that we did .i met to the mommis , the callejon of the kiss , the statu of the pipila , and more .so in my personal opinion and depending on which plan you travel the best idea is to go in a group because you can reduce costs on your travel , you have the opportunity to meet new people , and you enjoy more also the tour guide is an important key to get a complete knowledge of the new place .depening of what kind of person you are , you choose the sort of travel that you want to do but the most important thing is to enjoy the new experience .
