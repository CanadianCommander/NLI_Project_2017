the cars are one of the most big inventions that people found .it s very usefull in our daily lifes .people love cars and they think they ca nt live without them .they can take us everywhere we want .the car is a very good thing , but nobody think of its bad sights and effects .in the past , people have always been go there by food or by bicycle or some other things .this was very good for people s health because with walking or cycling , they were making some kinds of sports .people s bodies could stay young and healthy with this way .but then cars were invented and people forgot walking .because car is a very useful thing for them .day by day , the numbers of the cars are increasing .the interest of people to the cars are increasing too .if there are five members in a family it means this family has five cars .it seems good but in the fact it s not very nice for humanity .it s a danger for people because more cars mean more air pollution , more sound pollution , more stress , etc . .but people are nt aware of this danger and they continue driving even for short miles .but the most important thing in this situation is petrollium .petrollium resources are decreasing day by day in contrast the world s need to petrollium is increasing day by day .the world will face a big petrollium problem but nobody is aware of this problem .to deal with this problem , there are something that can be done .for example , for this problem goverments should do something immediately .they should persuade people to use means of transportation .it should be announced that people should use busses , or other means of transports more frequently .it would be a sollution for decreasing of petrollium and for traffic jam , air pollutioun , hard city life , sound pollution , etc . .if nothing will be done , we will face a world without cars .if we do nt want to live without our lovely , precious cars , we should stop using it for unnecesarry things .if we have short miles to go , we can walk to there or we can use our bicycles .with this way we wo nt have to live without our cars in the future and also we will have a better , more beatiful world .
