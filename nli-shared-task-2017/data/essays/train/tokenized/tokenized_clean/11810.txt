there are different opinions among people concernig whether having broad knowledge of many subject is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject .although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people in various problems , as far as i am concerned , i conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life .i will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea .the first reason is that because the society will change more complicated , the demand for the specialized knowledge or skills would increase .in fact , in ancient age , people should do everything well to survive , but now people do nt need to be capable of everything .for example , famous baseball star can earn enomous amout of money only because of his abilities of throwing balls fast .the second reason is that in modern society people can not obtain broad knowledge of many specific subject .nowadays socioty new knowledges and skills are produced so fast and much that we ca nt keep up with the pace of the development .if there is a person that is able , the person s faith is only his or her subjective faith .for example , we could not even imagine the internet only a thirty years ago .of course , broad knowledge of many subject can help people make their life balanced and rich .however , the more important things to do in modern society is to specialize in one specific subject a person can do well and interested in .in conclusion , i would rather specialize in one specific subject than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
