i disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and convepts than it is for them to learn facts .fist , only students have learn facts , then they will understand ideas and convepts .students have learn facts by themselves that they would have a deep expression of what they have done .if we just let the students understand ideas and concepts , they might not really learn facts .to let the students understand ideas and concepts is a requirment , but to let the studnets learn facts are more important .second , how does students to undetstand ideas and concepts are not better than learn facts ?for instance , we read a novel story , we know what it talks about , but sometimes we might mistakenly know what we have learn about .on the other hand , if you have learn facts .then it is more easier for you to understand ideas and concepts more clearly .for stundets  studing , the main point is to learn facts no matter what kind of subjects .it is proved that it always ture .so if you what to learn fast ?learn facts !it will help you a lot .last , as what we know , learning facts are more difficult for students to understand ideas and concepts .for most of students , they always did the ideas and convepts fist , then go on to research facts , at the end of it , it will spend lots of their time on it , and it did not deserve it .
