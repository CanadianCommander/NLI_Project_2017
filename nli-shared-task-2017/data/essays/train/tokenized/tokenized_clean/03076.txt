deciding whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is a complex issue .on one hand , a broad general knowledge is apprexiated within society .on the other hand , today s global and competitive business environment requires specialization on a certain area of interest .in my view , the advantages of specialization on a specific subject offsets the possible advantgaes of having a general knowledge of many academic subjects .firstly , business environment is getting more integrated and complicated day by day .technical developments in technology and science makes it impossible to know everything .since narrowing the focus of interest on one specific topic ease the intellectual improvement process .secondly , high competition in business and academic world motivates people to have in-depth knowledge about a certain field of interest .having confidence a specific topic can be considered as a prerequisite of professionalism .colleques value thoughts or opinions only if they trust a person s expertise and competency about the subject .thirdly , specialization is a growing trend in busines life .especially , expert are looked for in crises situations .thus , the ambiguity or recessions in business cycle may be an opportunity for a specialized employee to verify his/her competency on a specific subject .also , specialization enhance the probability of promotion or shortens the time needed to reach a career goal .for instance , nissan , the japanese car manufacturer , needed a new ceo for the inefficiency of operations causing losses in recent years .nissan offered the position to a renaults employee who specialized in increasing efficiency in operations and dealing with crisis situation .specialization enabled the manager to take steps quickly .under the light of above reasons , specializing on a specific topic rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a motivating factor behind success
