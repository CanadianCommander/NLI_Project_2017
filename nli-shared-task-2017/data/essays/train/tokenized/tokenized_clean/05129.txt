in general i agree with this statement , although i think it does nt make sense to suggest an exclusive choice .of course a student has to do both , understand ideas as well as learn facts .i think it has got to do a lot with differences between cultures .my education was definitly focused on understanding concepts .but i know for example from korea that students have to learn much more by heart .i will try to explane what i mean on an example from the field of music .in india it is common for tabla-players to learn many compositions by heart .although there exists a system for musical notation it has no relevance .everything is learned by heart from mere listenening .on the other hand you have the european tradition of staff notation and musical scores .it is not necessary to learn everything by heart because it can be looked up at every time .this fact is connected with a different attitude towards tradition .while in india it is more common to emphasize the continuity of a certain school or family tradition ( called gharana ) in europe more attention is paied on what is new or what seems to be new .of course both musical traditions develop and change in the course of time , but their way to new ways of expression is a different one .in india a tabla player ( who is a compser as well as a musician ) first learns many facts ( compositions ) , and then , after a long time of practising and trying to adapt the tradition he might introduce new features and invent his own compositions .in europe many composers ( who are not necesserily performing musicians ) started to compose at a very young age .before they had the chance to learn the history of music they already begin to understand some ideas and concepts and with the help of these develope compositions as objects .to summarize i would like to say that it depends on the cultural environment what importance has to be given to the understanding of ideas or to the learning of facts .
