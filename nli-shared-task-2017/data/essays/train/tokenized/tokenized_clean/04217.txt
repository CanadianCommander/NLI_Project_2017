there are two ways of learning nowadays ; either students learn in books and understand some ideas , or they learn thanks to work experience and special facts which is more important and relevant for me .personnally , with my student formation , i have had the chance to experience both .in an engineering school , you attend theoretical courses during a part of the year and then you have to perform an internship to go to the next level .the theoretical courses explain the ideas and concepts used in different companies and the internship gives the possibility to work on special facts , which put together make your own experience .at first i would say that the experience in a company , with some problems or special facts you have to face , is more relevant that some courses .but after reflection , i would say that we need both .it is not possible to learn and be able to face problems if we just attented some courses in class for a few years .the real experiences are essential to learn the best way and get the best skills .one can use all the theoretical courses we have had during the student formation and then make everything in practise on a real case .learning just by studying special facts is also not complete enough because it does not give the necessary skills to face other problems .the skills used to explain or solve some facts are only for that fact in particuliar but they are different with other problems .and it is impossible to study all the facts that can possibly exist .that is why the ideas and concepts learned in theoretical courses are important .so i think there has to be a balance between what is learned in theoretical courses and the experience lived outside the universe of school .they are both needed to have a great formation and great ideas , but they can not work seperately .each student has to take ideas and skills thanks to his teachers but also with his own experience which gives more human values than theoretical ones .
