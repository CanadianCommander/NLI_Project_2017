there are many jobs , places to go and ways to enjoy things .as the world becoming more and more complicated and the society growing .and the mentalistic things should also be growing , too .now a days , i see few young people helping their communities .so i agree to the subject because of 2 reasons .first , i see only few young people helping their communities .when media interviews the poor or the old , they say that they want to be loved and cared , it s the young people s job to do this .they just care for themselves and not others .the young people should know that helping the society is helping themselvessecondly , the young people only think of themselves .their are many ways to help the community , but they are avoiding these .they say that they are busy working , but are nt other people busy ?now a days , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves .because of these reasons , i think young people are not donating their time to help their own communities .they should make a time to volunteer and let the society be helped by themselves .
