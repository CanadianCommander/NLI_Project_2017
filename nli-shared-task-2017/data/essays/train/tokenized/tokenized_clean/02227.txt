in my opinion it is more important to understand ideas and concepts .students must deal with this mental buildings , as i would call them , all the time .they have to be flexible and have to know how to use them .if a student , or later as an employee , is short on facts he or she could always look them up .of course a base of facts is needed to understand ideas and concepts aswell as it is important to be flexible .if you do not know anything about your task you can not be flexible without a certain knowledge .but this should be just the basis on which one has to act .students have to know and understand the ideas and concepts with which they are working .for example in history you have to know what happend when but if you know what happend why and you do not know the date you can put the dates in a propper order because you know the idea behind it .you do not have to know the propper date of the boston tea party but if you know who did what and why it had been done you know that it was one of the crucial points to american independence .or if you can understand the differences between to ideas you can make up your own opinion on them .learning by just learning facts gives you big knowledge but no own opinion or own way of dealing with ideas or developing ideas or concepts .if one just knows the key facts one could still deal with the idea .you just have to know a little about the crucial points as for example marx and engles picture of human being to know the problems of communism .the facts of the way the communism devloped and the ideas differed are helpful later on but not necessarly .to sum up facts and ideas have got their place but the empasis should lie on the ideas .
