there is a saying , `` knowledge is one kind of power .i agree with that phrase because you can use knowledge as much as you know .some people think it is more useful to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have specific knowledge that you know very well .however , in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject which you are good at .to begin with , they are so many people who have common knowledge .specifically , the knowledge they have are not unique or special .therefore , in this competitive society people would have to compete with each other for a job that anyone can apply .it is not efficient to have knowledge that everybody knows .broad knowlege of many academic subjects is not a merit .for example , suppose there is a graduate who majored three subjects , history , business , and math .he would know many things from learning all the contents of three majors and utilize all the subjects he learned .because there is limited time , it is hard to learn all the three subjects precisely and deeply .he would only know the basics of each subject , not the advanced things .in addition , focusing on one subject will make you as an expertise .other subjects that you do nt know well can be solved by an expert on that field .it is more effective to take advice from him and ask questions that you are not clear with .it is better to focus on the thing a person are good at so the experts can share their knowledge in an advanced way .for example , people from different fields , can help each other by combining their own knowledge .it is a win win game .in conclusion , for these unavoidable reasons , i firmly believe people should develop and stick on to their own special knowledge .
