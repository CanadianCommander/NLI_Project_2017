the given statement is`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .i disagree with the above statement because , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems to be alright when in childhood , but this seems to be complex and cumbersome as we grow older and older .firstly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly .for an example , consider a high school student .if he needs to have a broad knowledge of many subjects even after his high school , apart from his personal interest which he shows at a particular subject , the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher studies becomes troublesome .secondly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , the frequency at which we do get update about these subjects greatly matters .we need to have a greater frequency of updation in all areas , which is not a simpler task .for an example , consider a student studying computer sciences .the other academic subjects include some main aspects from electronics , electricals , communications and like wise .the frequency at which he gets updated in his core subject ( computer sciences ) slows down if he needs to have broad knowledge of other academic subjects .thirdly , having broad knowledge of other academic subjects do helps , but not at a considerable rate .considering the example illustrated in the above ( second ) aspect , the student could hardly get bugs in other areas which he integrates with his core subject .in recent days , debugging mechanisms are in plethora and it can be said that a person need not have a broad knowledge of other academic subjects .considering the above reasons , i conclude that i disagree with the given statement .
