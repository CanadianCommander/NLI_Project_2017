understanding is the basis of learning .manipulated knowledges forms the ideas and consepts .ideas and consepts are reasons of the facts .indeed learning facts without understanding theory behind them is useless .in addition learned ideas and concets are also useless without relating with the facts .these two are connected to each other .ideas and consepts are important on learning but without relating with real facts , teaching system constructs useless brains .students sure need to understant the main theories behind the real events .understanding main ideas give the ability of making brain storms and ability to find relations between knowledges .according to the student psyhcology , when the ideas do not related with real examples , knowledges hung up in the air .for instanece , i were giving extra physics lectures to my neigbours little boy .he always ask me to give real examples for the subjects .it is neccesary to inform students about ideas and make relations by facts .if consider the other option , teaching students the lectures based on facts .there should be many questions occur in their minds .why , how , when . ..it is geting more and more difficult to answer all those questions by only informing them with facts .an instructor can not possibly teach about chemical lessons .matter consist of atoms and atoms inhales electrons and protons .it is impossible to understant main scince theories with facts .to sum up , education can not be established on only ideas , theoris and concepts .they should be related eith the real examples and facts .in addition no one can possibly teach or undestand most subjects by facts .
