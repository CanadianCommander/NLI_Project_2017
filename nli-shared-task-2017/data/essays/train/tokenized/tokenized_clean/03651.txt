in twenty years i believe that the number of cars in use will have fallen .this is mainly due to increasing expenses linked to owning a car coupled with the fact that public transportation is becoming easier , cheaper and more efficient to use .not forgetting , of course , growing awareness in the damages caused to the environment .owning a car is becoming more and more expensive .at this rate in twenty years time a lot of people will probably no longer be able to afford such a luxury .petrol prices are spirelling evermore out of control .the stock market price is at an all time high and nothing seems to be indicating that this trend will change and that prices will fall back down .add to this factor , the price of insurance , of car repairs , of the car itself as well as parking .numbers have actually shown that in france the number of new cars being sold has dropped dramatically these past few years .the number of cars already in circulation being so high people can easily find what they re looking for at a convenient price on the second-hand market .i think that public tranportation also has its role to play .as fuel prices rise , traffic jams and pollution increase , people seem to be turning more and more to public tranportation .public transportation has evolved tremendously the past few years .bus lanes have been privileged in order to avoid traffic jams , trains are going faster and faster at extremely competitive prices and a growing number of cities are loaning out bicycles free of charge .all this plus the huge publicity campaigns in order to promote public transport and reduce the number of cars .the fact remains that , especially in big cities , people prefer using public transport to the hassle linked to using a car .take paris for example , it is cheaper , faster and far less stressful to use the metro then to spend hours stuck in traffic jams with parisiens yelling at you from all sides and then having to look for a parking space ( which you ll also have to pay for ) .not to mention the impact on the environment .the growing awareness and support for environmental issues is also slowly beginning to reduce the use of cars .in my opinion , as the years pass this factor will play an evermore important role in the number of cars on the road .
