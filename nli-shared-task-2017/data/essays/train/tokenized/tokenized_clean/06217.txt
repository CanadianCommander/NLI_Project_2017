the humankind always need succeed to reach good life standards therefore success is a very important aspect of humanslife .everyone has a different point of views about the idea of success .people who want to be successful need to try new things and need to find different ways .these are my following reasons .firstly , if someone reaches the thing which he wants to do for the first time , than it is not about being successful , but about being lucky .the best example for this is thomas edison .he tried to find the electricity for several times , but he did not think that he was not be able to invite it .he always tried and tried .he said that , ` i tried millions of times to find the electricity , but i never give up trying .i am happy that i can know the ways which i ca nt be successful about this finding .`it means , taking the risks on the way which goes to being successful is the best idea for finding the right way .he managed ; because he took all the risks on this way .in addition to this , taking risks to be successful is very important to manage what is wanted to do .if someone wants to cook very well , then they need to make distasteful foods first .people need to try new things .furthermore , in the schools .teachers ask questions to their students .someone , who is not sure about the answer , can raise the hand and go to the blackboard to solve the question .even the solution that the student did is wrong , this is the best way of learning the right for students .specially in mathematics classes .even though i was not sure about the solution , i always wanted to try to solve and i was always the volunteer .the last but not least , the way which goes to succeed is not always clear , there is often difficulties .for example , someone wants to study abroad , brings everything in his behind and goes to the country where he will study .in this situtation , he takes a risk loosing his all relationships between friends and even between his family .moreover , he also takes a risk of not knowing someone from this country .if he needs a help , then there is nobody at the first times when he goes this country .on the other hand , at the end of this risks , he will return to his own counrty as knowing new languages and being a gratuated from a university , new opportunities etc .there is only thing why he did so many things , just for being successful , for being an important man in his job .all in all , as i said before , for being successful , taking risks is the most important thing .both , if someone takes risks then at the and of that , it is surely that he wiil be able to manage this , and if someone gets successful for the first time , is not about being successful .my motto is , experience is the mother of wisdom .if persons experience all the ways and take all the risk , it is understandable that they are gonna be successful and manage what they want to do .
