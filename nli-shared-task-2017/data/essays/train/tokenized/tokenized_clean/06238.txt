there are a lot of problems which the great amount of cars causes nowadays : traffic jam , pollution , etc .hopefully , some say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now .of course , there are others who maintain even after more than twenty years , cars are not going to decrease .in my opinion , there will be fewer cars in twenty years in that due to rapidly growing technology , there will be some devices which are going to replace cars .firstly , as you know , there are many airplanes which produce less pollution than cars per person .they become more and more comfortable to take and cheaper .people are going to use flights rahter than taking their own cars sooner or later .this will , at last , reduces the number of cars .for the second thing , oil and gas which cars need to work , are decreasing in quantity .accordingly , they are really expensive now and never stop increasing .technologists and scientists , somehow , need to develop other vehicles which just need natural resources .those vehicles will replace cars and bring the earth back to the clean condition .above all , the goverments all over the world need to make a strict bill which eventually reduces cars to reduce pollution .if they do nt , this world are going to be covered only by air pollution .following surveys done recently , it is said that many countries require their citizens to take public transportation , not their cars .in summary , i believe people who use cars are going to decrease steadily for various reasons .there will be great vehicles with making almost no pollution soon because people in the world including technology experts and scientists , are concerned about the pollution , and they are doing thier best to make better and cleaner vehicles .as flights are getting cheaper , many people starts to use them instead of using cars .
