nowadays , successful people always like to try new things and take risks in their lives .i totally agree with this statement for some good reasons .first of all , people like to say that `` it is never too old to learn  .we are still too young to stop trying and learning new things .if we never try , we will never know what gonna happened .eventhough sometimes we would not be successful as a result of trying new stuff , we still can face the bad situation bravely and treat it as our treasure experiences in our life and we will learn from it as well .for example , i came to canada with my family two years ago , since we are not english speaker we had to learn english from `` abc  .eventhough that is really hard for us but we never stop our steps .and my grandma is 80 years old now and she still wants me to teach her how to use internet .second , our world keeps changing ever single day .if we stop learning , we will really fall behind so we must keep going for ourselves and our next generation .since everything in the world needs people to create an develope , we should never stop learning and exploring new things .third , in my point of view , some people give up or stop learning things because they are too lazy to try and they think that will be hard for them , on the other hand , they are kind of satisfied by their own situations .maybe that is really fine for them to stop going , but they will lose so many chance to be successful .maybe they will not suffer a lot from some hard experience but at they same time they will lose the chance to experience the exciting process .because no body can foresee the future so we should try our best and built a beautiful life for ourselves . : )
