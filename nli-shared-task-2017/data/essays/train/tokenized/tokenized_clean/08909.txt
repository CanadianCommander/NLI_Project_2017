when i was young , i used to go to a church and help older people who were living in my communities .since i was young , helping tasks were not that serious but i still remember that i had felt good and great whenever i helped them .however , as i grew older , i had to focus on studying high school subjects such as math , history and chemistry to enter a prestigious university .naturally i could nt spend my `` important  time to help my communities .now i regret that much and think young people should give enough time to helping their communities baecause of the following reason .first of all , we are able to feel how happy we are right now by helping our commnunities .there are a lot of ways of helping communities .among them , taking care of older people whose sons or daughters do nt live near is an important task .they feel lonely and isolated so they need intersts of others and giving some intersts and helps to them are not that hard .during giving them helps , we could feel how happy situations we live in now and love our own parents more than before .in these days , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they have lots of thing to do .however , consider wisely and just invest a little time to helping the communities and feel great on our .life .
