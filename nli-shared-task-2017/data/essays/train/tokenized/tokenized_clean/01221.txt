shaping of the human thinking style is possible .there is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them .this difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families .there are two ways to teach someting to somebody .the first one is teaching the reasons , therefore the ideas and concepts .by this technique the student will be learning what is going on .there he will have the power for making judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned .for example , he/she will will be able to fix someting he has learned by means of repairing it , or will be improving that thing .in two cases what happens is natural .however , this method seems to be best fit for a fast evolution , has a negative side .the other side of the madallion is that this process will be extremely time consuming , when we the number of things to be teached increases .the other side of the madallion is learning by facts .in this case the the learning curve is steep .since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts , he/she will not be able to comment about it in the future .so this stuff will be prone to degregations .in addition , the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is genius .to sum up , the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things .but its maybe the most important thing to be realised that all human beings are different .as we all have different abilities and unabilities .the real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being teached .a genius will learn faster , so load all the data with only facts to him k , he will just ask one thing to get the idea , and invent something .choose the right combination for the custom class that you teach .that s why the teachers are being trained for .
