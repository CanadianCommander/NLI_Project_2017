how do we recognize and differentiate successful people from other people ?what is the secret that brings someone from bottom to top ?is it a lightly touch given by one s guardian angel , or a genius one is born with or merely just luck ?i think that successful people are defined by their creating or discovering of something that others have not .it is their ability to forsee things and have the courage and ambition to realize them .it is not only that they do take risks what leads them to success , but it also the commitment and the sacrifices they make along the way to success .for example this year s oscar winner for best director martin scorsese , has comitted his life to a career of directing movies .for many years he made films that others did not dare to make .for many years he was nominated for the oscar but remained empty handed .but he did not yield and he continued to make movies with the same enthusiasm and resolution , always trying something different and new , wich finally brought him the award .he is an example of lifelong success .some people might be coragous , some very lucky .but i believe that what makes a person different and gifted than the other people is his or her resolution and the undying belief in what one s doing .
