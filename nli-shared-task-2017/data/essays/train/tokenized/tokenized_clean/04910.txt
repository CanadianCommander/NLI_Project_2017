i will begin my essay by saying that i agree with this statement , and then i will go on in explaining why i feel this way .based on my own experience as a student , the most rewarding knowledge is the one that is cultivated by hard work , and understanding of the great ideas that are behind the facts that are exposed to us .from what i can remember , the things that i consider i have really learned in my life as a student are those that came from the process of trying to understand the logic and the dynamic of the problem i was challenged to study , as opposed to those things that i tried to learned by memorizing dates , names and places .if anything , the only time when i have really come to learn and acknowledge important dates and names in a relevant process in history , it is because i have taken the time to understand the logic of the historical sequence , so that i can place the events according to the ideas and concepts that are behind each episode in history .those students that learn only facts with nothing behind them , will sure be forgetting what they learned within a month , because the learning process did nt come form understanding the importance of those facts in an specific situation .the learning process , in the case of those students , came from the need to be passing through the courses , tests , and exams , without knowing if the things they were asked to know were importante in their lifes , or their carrers .aside from that , i believe that ideas and concepts are tools that students have for their ongoing studies , and also for life .once a person has studied a concept , and has struggled with the logic of it , and has finally succeded into understanding it , that concept will last on in their minds forever as a tool to understand other processes , or other concepts .it is because of those reasons that i believe that true knowledge comes from understanding ideas and concepts , rather than from learning facts .
