i agree with the statement that the sucessfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .this is the human nature to find new ways of life .his intentions are to increase the more and more knowledge and learn more skills .right from the evolution of the humanity , they are inventing the new things and bringing the best metods to improve the life .it is only due to the risk taking ability that we are in the age of the modern technologies .if no one took risks in the life there will be nothing now .you can not say that the new technologies are available without risks .in this era , we cannt think without the electricity , aeroplane , satalites and the medical facilities .all these facilities are achieved by taking life risks .there are sevral stories of the successful persons who achieved all with thier risk taking ability .for example the right brothers who invented the aeroplane .they become the inventors by taking the risks .as people say `` satisfaction is death  .this means that we have to find the new ways of life .we should not stagnate with the old methods and skills .we have improve them or change them .we can achieve every thing .nothing is impossible in this world .peoples are trying to find new horizons in the life .for example now they are trying to find the new planet to live .human is different due to his brain power fropm other animals and with this power he eliminates the impossible word from his life all in all , to get the new things you have to take the risk .this is the human naure to take the risks and find new paths which can lead him to the new heights .
