we all are familiar with the phrase ` knowledge is power  .which is indeed a truth in itself as knowlege af any kind nerver lets you down when you are in a crunch situation .therefore i agree that it is better to have knowledge of many subjects as its makes an individual intellectually sound and imparts in him the quality of decision making .it can be a good option to specialize in one specific subject if one is really interested in any reasearch activity but otherwise it should be diversed and should consists many interesting topics within his selected course and also have some general subjects like arts , ecology , biology etc .it helps individual to be more powerful in this competetive world .in order to survive in this world one should have a quality to adapt to any situation and that is only possible if he has a chance to navigate through the vast ocean of knowledge .i can give my own example .i had a subject in highschool name scoteer-motor cycle repairing .it was an optional subject which taught me some basics of how to service our bikes , how to maintain them .the advantage now i am having that i can service my own bike free of cost .it also helps me in keeoping by bike in good condition .so we can see that the subject which seemed to have no weightage in my acedemaics rather helped me in my future to save money , which is indeed a requirement of the time for me now .so we can conclude that no knowledge goes waste .somewhere sometime in our life we may require to use the knowledge which was learnt just as a formality in the classrooms .so its better to be prepared for our life with vast knowledge from broad knowledge rather than having a approach of getting limited common-sense knowledge by learning specific subjects .
