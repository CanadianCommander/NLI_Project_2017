i think that there is a difference between how young and old people express the way they enjoy life .not everyone expresses this kind of emotion by accompanying it with the stereotypical connotation of `` enjoying life  such as carefree days , endless laughs and no responsabilities .for this reason i do not agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people .as a matter of fact , i think older people can develop subtler , more refined and , why not , more precious ways of appreciating life .young people , most of the time , are bound to a definition of fun that is imposed by the media , which involves concerts , all-night partying , strenuous lifestyles and the idea that `` someone , somewhere , is having more fun than i am  .this makes most young people feel compelled to do more and more in order to show others that they are enjoying themselves rather then actually cherish their experiences .older people learn in time that enjoying life can be associated with more relaxed and `` tailored  activities , such as hobbies or brief holidays .i think that it might be even easier for some older people to enjoy life firstly because they can count on more financial stability and secondly because they have a lot less time to dedicate to themselves , which makes this time a lot more valuable .hobbies are activites people cultivate over long periods of time , and the passion with which they nurture them is a very good example of how much a person can enjoy him or herself .i consider holidays as another good example .when young people go on holiday , they tend to lead a lifestyle very similar to that that awaits them at home - if not more stressful ; going out every night , staying up very late , `` trying a bit of everything  .older people have less time to travel but more money to spend on their trips , which enables them to choose destinations and vacation types that will make them get the most out of that limited time and , at the end of the day , `` enjoy life  more .
