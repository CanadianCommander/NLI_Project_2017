i agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because people can live flexibly and make better comunications with people .in my opinion , academic knowledeges should be useful in the real society .if not , i believe that there is no meaning to get any of them .first , if we have broad academic knowledge , we have more possibilities to get a job in various industries .for instance , if we know well about both industrial technology and business , we could get a job of a engineer or a business person in a trading company .in contrast , i can never thought to become a engineer without any knowledges of such kind of field .in addition , broad knowledge makes our communication more flexible and diversified .with much information about vaious fields , we can make good conversations and widen our network with people .good communication and relationship with people is necessary and required in life .furthermore , the diversity of academic background enables us to solve any complecated problems either in a office or in a personal situation .as a result of it , we can survive well in the competitive society and win a better status .as a consequence , broad knowledge helps people more than special knowledge in one apecific subject .in order to survive in the competitive society , we need to acquire wider useful knowledge .hence , i think that studying broadly is more helpful than studying just one specific issue .
