differences between generations have been public concerns , even put into debates for a long time .among which there exists a widely discussed one - whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .needless to say , the answer varies from person to person .as far as i am concerned , i agree with the above statement not only because young people appreciate diversity more , but also because they are more welcome to new things .to begin with , with the development of human civilization , especially now globalization is an undeniable trend , diversity is increasingly acceptable and admired .there are examples everywhere .young people , generally speaking , enjoy traveling to different places .they are fascinated by diverse cultures and people they meet .however , older people tend to stay in one place , and even hate changes .in that case , their enjoyments are not comparable to their young counterparts .in the second place , in contrast to older people. , young generation are more willing to accept novelties and enjoy them .for instance , a couple of days ago , i was in the roller coaster in bejing amusing park .it is an exciting experience , a challenge both pysically and mentally .however , my parents just looked away and would not give a try .therefore , it is a pity that they never enjoy those thrillers in life , which are taken advantages by us young .nevertheless , to be fair , older people are blessed with their own merits .on one hand , they pay more attention to details in life , which enable them to find out beauty in the somewhat mundane world .on the other hand , they are more easily to be satisfied , thus feel more grateful to life , even if they are in adversity .in a nutshell , despite all the advantages enjoyed by older people , i will not hesitate to side with the statement that life is more enjoyable to young .my conclusion is based on the fact that young people are happier with new experiences .further more , diversity are held in higher regard in youths .therefore , modern society is more appealing to them .however , we can never deny that every person enjoys his or her own happiness and blessings , which has not much to do with his or her age .as long as we develop a genuine appreciation for life itself , life is definitely more beautiful .
