traveling in a group led by a tour guide have advantages and disadvantages .first , people who travel with group by a tour guide can learn many information from a tour guide .in addition , they can improve their knowledge about places which they visited .second , it is opportunity to make new friends in a group .furthermore it is enjoyable talking and seeing new places with other people .because of different opinions about new places , people can share their ideas and enjoy with a group .on the other hand , traveling in a group can be stressful because people must think other people and listen a tour guide .they can not be more independent .i prefer traveling with my family because i feel more comfortable when i see new places and show my opinion .i deem that i can learn information about places with traveling in agroup led by tour guide .on the other hand , my family say about the historical places and its information .we are more dependent and if we are getting the place , we can change our way to other place .in my country , turkey , people usually prefer to travel in a group led because it is less expensive then traveling with their families but it is more stressful and exhausting .furthermore , because of economic situations in turkey , people can not effort to travel other contries or to travel with themselves .in conclusion , i would like to travel with my family and my friends eventhough it is expensive in my country .i have come to america by myself , now i struggle to learn information about america by myself .
