these day , companies made many new items which is only for women .there are many iems such as desks , chairs are made simply for women .in addition , in korea , there are going to have cars which are only for woman to use it .however , many people are curious about that if those cars are going to sell a lot .in my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all , now , people are much concern about the enviornment .as you see , there are many cars are bring about the air pollution problems .people are hard to breath and even some people are getting illness because of the air pollution .in addition , there are not much oil left in the earth and price of the oil is much higher than before .thus people are hard to afford it because of the high cost .now , people are think about their lack of recource and try to conserve it .second , as the population grows , people need more area to live in .if there are many cars , people have to live in much shorter space .this is because , we need parking areas and roads for those many cars .moreover , people want the parks , art gallery near by their living .parents want to have a space more for kids .as you see , in the cities , there are not much places for the kids because of the parking lots and roads .thus , people are more willing to build facilities such as libraries , parks rather than building the roads for cars .in conclusion , i think there will be fewer cars in use because of that people are now concerning about air polution problems , and as population grows , people are think about the space they live in .they want to have the place which is more beneficial to their childern .
