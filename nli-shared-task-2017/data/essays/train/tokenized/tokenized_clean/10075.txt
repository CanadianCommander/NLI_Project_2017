i agree with the statement which is `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .why do i agree with that statement ?first , because of population .many people try to success in one subject so the rate fo competition is very high .if people who has knowledge as well as general people , they can not be on top in the major .second , if people who wants to success is afraid of taking risks , they mentally or tequnically can not move from the point where they are now .they should take risks and get knowledge and experiences from risks .they have to grow up with their knowledge and experiences .that s why i agree with the statement .there are a lot of people who want to success with the same major .even in one school has a lot of raivals .when they can success , they whould make efforts more than any other people .and they should get knowledge and experiences while they make efforts .the imformation and experiences would help them .
