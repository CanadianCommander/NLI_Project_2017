i am going to explain why i agree that a variety of academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .it is important to know that i am looking at this under specific conditions .it makes a difference if you are going to work in research where specialisation is mandatory or if you want to work for a company in an other department other than research .i am now refering to people in the business that would like to climb the ladder in a company .i am going to refer on one main aspect that highlights the pros of a broad knowledge .if a persons goal is to have a career and to go up in a companys hirarchy it is better for that person to understand the business as a whole .he may switch from different departments and will therefore encounter several issues from many departments .that person will also have to deliver advice and solution for different problems .of course he will also need to know where to get missing information on a topic .if he is a generalist he might not know all details of a solution or might oversee problems but he will be able to get the information he needs from specialist .as a generalist he should have enough insight to know how to prepare the input of the specialist in a form that can be understood by everyone .he needs to know how to use the information for his company and how it would impact other departments .idealy that person will also be able to connect aspects from several specialist in different ranges and put them togheter in a good way .as a conclusion i would say , that given specific facts , for example work , that influence this topic , it is better to have a wider range of knowledge than to be specialized .wider knowlegde will help carreer driven people to climb the ladder faster since they will be able to understand and handle upcoming issues better than specialists do .their general knowledge will make them better leaders since they know the company as a whole and do not only see it with the eyes of one department only .
