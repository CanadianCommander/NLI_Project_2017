there are several good reasons why i believe that is better for students to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .first of all , i think that nowadays , work problems are very difficult to resolve and involve a lot of skills like computers knowledge or to know a different language .currently , companies need people to overcome this sort of integrated problems , and the person has to have a broad knowledge .secondly , if students have more skills or abilities , they will have more likelihood to find a job .therefore , if they become borried in their work , they can apply to others job because people with a broader knowledge can do more things than the others .although it is true that some people say that companies pay more to people who know how to resolve a specific task , i think that is better for a person earn less money but with a lot of likelihood to get a job , than a person who can earn a lot of money , but working in a only one type of job .world market today are very difficult , people are hired currently and consecuently they have to look for a job more than ever , for this reason i believe that is better for a person to has a broad knowledge .i can support my opinion with a personal experience that i lived five years ago .i was working in cnn as a journalist , and suddenly i heard that the company board needed someone to work in trade area .after a brief hiring process , i got the position only because i had studied a finance course in university .in my opinion , i think that have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects is better than specialize in one specific one , because a person have more posibilities to get a job , to resolve better the work problems and thirdly , because encourage his knoledge .
