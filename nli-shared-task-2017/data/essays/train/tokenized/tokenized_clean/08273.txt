young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i will argue in favour of this statement by using several supporting aspects which are directly related to the topic .one big reason why this statement is true , is that individualism and personal achievement concerning the own career are becoming the ultimate goal for everyone in society .there is no time and room left to help old people , take care of children or foster public compounds .due to that increasing egotism , young people show a lack of responsibility and careness of their direct human counterparts in their nearby communities .modern art of life is strongly indicating that personal achievement is a must-have and a life surviving necessity to every young , ambitious and aspiring man or woman .so if everyone is preoccupied by reaching his own goals , there is no progress of society anymore .in fact , society would decrease and looses all its values or achievement it has reached over the centuries .so individuality and egotism inevitably leads to a downgraded society and is a real danger to everyone living in this society .so young people should spend more time by supporting society in a way each fits in best .it is even a duty for young energetic people to supplement their power and vitality to support their surrounding community .a equilibrium between helping communities and personal achievement must be reached by everyone .but this must be taught bei the elder society members , and thus this message must be conveyed from top to bottom .if the adults can  t reach the young people no more , one must not wonder about the growing egotism and refusal to support local or federal community .in my opinion this is a real problem to society and will preoccupy us a lot in the future .the failures of the previous generations are now seen in their offspring .
