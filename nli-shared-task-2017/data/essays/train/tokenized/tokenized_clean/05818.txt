i completely agree with the statement ` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are so many examples that prove this statement to be true .i am taking a psychology class at my school and we actually had an assignment about this .we had to bring an advertisement to class out of a magazine or newspaper that represents a product .advertisements are always exaggerated to be better than they actually are .people advertise their products in order to sell it .it is a business and no business will be successful without positive feedback .of course , if the product seems good , people are going to want to buy it .the advertisement that i brought into class was a cigarette ad .i found it on the back of a magazine lying around at school .the cigarette brand was `` kool .the ad showed a young man laughing and seeming happy .he was holding a trumpet trumpet in one hand while holding a cigarette in the other .this advertisement made cigarettes seem much better than they really are .everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for your health and are in general just disgusting , but ads like these make people think twice .another example of making products look better than they truely are , are food products .many food companies that produce the same food as another company , will compete with that company .both food companies will have to make their foods look better and sound better than that of the other company s .these advertisements will start popping up everywhere like on tv .advertisements like these are found everywhere you go .when you are at home , you will se advertisements on tv or receive it in the mail .when you are walking through the city , you will see posters hanging on the sides of the street or on the side of a bus .people can not get away from it , which is good for the businesses , but bad for the people .people will automatically be attracted to certain products that seem very good on an advertisement .
