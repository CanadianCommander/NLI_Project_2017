if you had asked me this question five years ago , i would have said , that there would be a sharp increase in number of cars during the twenty years time .since , i was not aware of the fact that cars have plenty of negative influences to the environment that we have been living .in addition to that , petroleum prices are increasing extremely sharply .nevertheless , i , now , absolutely claim that the amount of cars will drop significantly in twenty years time , may be shorter .therefore , i strictly say that there will be less automobiles in the coming future .the reason that i was thinking that the number of cars would increase was my desire to the car technology and the possibility of a reduction in prices .i was believing that car designs were wonderful and everybody was aware of this fact .thus , each and every person would buy cars as much as they can .another reason for this belief is that , since the brands are getting larger and rivalry is increasing , the prices of the cars would fall .i did not come to a conclusion about the prices opf the cars .they are decreasing as the days pass by .however , i had seen that the automobile desire was only my characteristic .most of the people istead of buying cars are now investing on other properties , such as flats or cooperatives .why i am now thinking in this way , that the number of cars will decay , is now i am aware of the effects of cars to the envoropnment .furthermore a considerable number of people are also agreeing with me and they are all aware of this damaging effects .therefore , most of the people will quit using cars , at least they will use public transportation , which is a good alternative for private car usage .since most of the people will be carried just by one bus or other sort of transportation , it will be more clean .another reason for thinking in this way is actually a lesser crucial point that compared to the one mentioned above , which is the high prices of the oil used for cars .after the sharp rise in 2004 , the car usage decreased enormously .especially in less developed countries , drivers quit using the privae cars .it seems that the current prices will not vary during the coming future .hence , this will influence the number of cars used on roads .if we take all of the factors mentioned above into consideration after a detailed observation of each point , we can come to a conclusion that , because of negative effects of the cars to environment and high gas prices , the usage of the cars will drop .for the following twenty years time , i am not expecting a sharp fall but degree bu degree .if the usage of the public transportation is enhanced and if the people are warned and educated due to the side effects of cars to the environment , this fall may be faster to a certain degree .
