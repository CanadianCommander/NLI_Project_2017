advertising is a major category and a fast-growing trade in today s world .it is a wide field that has managed to gain control of how we view everything around us , from politics to groceries .we see advertisements everywhere ; on televisions , in magazines , in newspapers , on the streets , we even listen to them on the radio .adveritising has become a field of competition between companies , each company trying to present its product in a perfect picture to the consumer .but is that product really as good as the commercial claims it to be ?i agree with the statement , that most advertisements ( if not all ) make products seem much better than they really are .for i have been a victim of such false commercials repeatedly .i recall buying an expensive shampoo upon seeing its advertisement that promised and guaranteed longer hair in one month .of course , i did nt notice any difference to my hair growth rate , even after two months of usage .i wonder why most companies ca nt release a product they are confident enough about , so they would nt need to add misleading information to their commercials .i do nt think it s fair to the consumer ( or to the consumer s pocket ) to be fooled into buying something that does nt match the description he/she had in mind .i think products should be professionally compared to their commercials before viewing them in the media .that would , no doubt , decrease such misguiding advertisements .but i guess that , over the years , one gathers experience , and eventually knows what to believe and what not to .
