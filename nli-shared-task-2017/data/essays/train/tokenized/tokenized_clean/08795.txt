it is often assumed that working things the right way , the way we are taught , is a major key to success .i believe that this statement is right .however i believe real success happens to those who bring in new ideas and take risks .it is true that when people are taught to work on something and do it the right way they will be efficient and successful .for example , someone who has been taught how to make cookies and how to run a shop could open a cookie shop and be successful at selling cookies .i can see no reason at all why this person would not earn his life by selling cookies .however , take someone pretty creative and who enjoys taking risks .this person would open a cookie shop and sell cinnamon flavoured cookies as well as cherry flavoured cookies , and this way differentiate itself from other cookie shops .there are two endings to this story , this new business is a complete failure or a real success .this person has taken risks and invested in its new ideas without knowing if these would meet the costumers  tastes or not .and if this creative person succeeds , i am convinced that its business will outline the common cookie shop business .another success that is engendered by taking risks is the self satisfaction that is brings .being successful for its own idea is far more gratifying than doing things right .great successes that qre famous worldwide are always born from an innovative concept , and this in all areas .famous film directors would not be so famous if they did not introduce a new vision of film directing .in finance , brokers that earn the most are those who take the most significant and relevant risks .bill gate would not be worldly known ( and immensely wealthy ) if he had not invested in a revolutionary idea .
