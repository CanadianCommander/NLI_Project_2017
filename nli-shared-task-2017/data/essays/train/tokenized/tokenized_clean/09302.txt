`` young people enjoy life more than older people do.  , is that kind of phrase ones can often hear in modern , western countries , where enjoyment seems to be one of lifes biggest goals .wheather this is true or not it will all come down to the point of defining and measuring `` joy  .but let me approach this matter step by step .it might seem natural and obvious to believe in this simple sentence because of the physical and mental abilities of young people .they are healthy , strong , flexible and abitious to conquer the world , make inventions , found families and many more important faktors of life .but is this really a joy any time ?they are often fight their hectic and fast environment and get quickly older , visible in burnouts , psychological problems , affection for drug usage and crime .i would agree that young people have an higher interest in their environment in general , but it does not say if this interest to create , explain and dominate is joyous or a need , meybee genetically predetermined .how about older people ?when we hear this we might think of those tied into bed , unable to eat and care for themselves .but if you think twice you can find a lot of older people , who are happy with a slower live .my grandparents still travel more foreign countries a year i could even afford .others write books and give their experience to the younger generation .we should not be mislead by the idea of `` maximizing joy  in terms of spending more money , doing more extrem activities and so on is always desireable .to summarize it i might be allowed to refence to kant , a german philosopher .more than 200 years ago he wrote , it is never possible to define a overwhelming good wich accounts for everybody but everybody shall have the right within certain borders to find his own satisfaction ( quoted rater freely ) .therefore i am tempted to say this question is to be answered indivually .of course we can discuss it , but the answears tranferred into real politics will quickly show very unpleasing results i assume .
