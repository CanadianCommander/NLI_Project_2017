there are two types of people in the world in my opinion : who is brave and who is not brave .the braves are that people who can look at the future and take risks , the not braves can not take important decisions for their own future .i believe that in his own life every person must risks and fights for the things that he or she wants to do , without thinks too much time if his or her is right or wrong .for example , i did not want to go to university after the secondary school and i began to work immediately .after some year , i have think that i would go to the university , but without stop working .since that moment , i am studying and working in the same time , without think that it is more difficult that to do only one thing , becouse it is a target whose i want to arrive .i do not agree with the people who wants to have a quiet life without any kind of risk , becouse that people do not have the capacity to think about their own future and they are happy to remain at the same level of life for many many years .another example that i can give is that i would do the engineer after the university and not the employee for the rest of my life , becouse in my opinion is better the life of a free professionist , who can spend his time and his money in the way who he can think is right , than the life of the employee , who is not indipendent and has the same conditions of life for many time .sure , one employee do not risk to do not have his payment , but the life of a free professionist in more exciting and can gives to me many satisfactions , altought it will not gives to me the same rassicurations to have the payment every month of the year .to finish , one life without risks is one life without target .
