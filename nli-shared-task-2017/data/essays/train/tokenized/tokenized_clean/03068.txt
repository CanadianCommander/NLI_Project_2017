the issue at hand , is who does enjoys life , young people or old people ??this subject is an interesing one , because it challanges all ages to enjoy life regardeless of their age .from my point of view , i believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones because they have all the capabiliities , health , and energy to enjoy life .the first reason i believe that younger people enjoy life more than older ones is because they have the motivation towards life , and life without motivation is like a car without oil .for example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description , or his capabilities , and from my point of view this is an ejoying experience .wheras , an older age person does not have the motivtion nor energy towards achieving any of his remaining goals .another reason i believe that young people enjoy life more is that they have the facilities to face all srrounding problems and obstacles .obstacles that affect in daily life , obstacles challanges the younger peolple , and thus makes life more enjoyable rather than depressing them .however , older people will be depressed while facing problems , and they might not be able to face such encouuntering problems .furthermore , young people are healthier than older ones , so they can move easily , and enjoy all the entertainments in life , such as travelling , swimming , practice sports , ...ect .wheras older peope do not have the capabilities to enjoy entertainments in life .finally , for the mentioned points , i believe that younger people enjoy life more that older ones , because they are the ones who accelarates the life process , and they are the ones who enjoy this .
