the issue here is which one will be better to have for academic knowledge , broad subjects or specialized in one specific subject .it is very complicated issue to choose one opinoin and to explain reasons to decide .i would have to say that both are important equally , and i may not say that wheather i agree or disagree the issue above .i might have to say that it perfectly depends upon the situation for undergraduate or graduate students .i would like to explain my own opnion that it is hard to choose one issue .for college students , it is better to have wide range of knowledge in many academic fields .after graduation of high school , young college students are still are not legally grown up .however mentally , they are going to face and study for real knowledge for their life .i believe that most high school graduates have strong long-term goal for their own life , but they have never met advanced subjects before entering college .they should see various fields to choose the specific field for their own life .it really important chance for them .for deeper studies in graduate schools , students have to be specialist for their own field .they need to know further knowledge and to have deeper unerstanding on the field that they already have chosen during being college students before .as graduate students , they rather to study and focus on specific subject to have compatitiveness to go to the real world .of cource some will not go out of boundary of university , but this kind of students also fosuc on specific subject to be a professer something like that .in conclusion , i agree that students must do both broad and specific academic knowledge .however i have to say that it is fully depends on their situation .one more thing that i would have to say is that students must have their unique and strong compatitiveness , selling point .to have this unique and strong compatitiveness , students have to think deeply to select what they really like and want to be .what ever we do , time goes on .time is limited to everyone .students , please do nt waste time .the world is yours .be ambitious and be global leader .
