in my country that is to say in france , at school we are studing various classes .but is nt it better to be specialize in one specific subject than having broad of knowledgeof many academic subjects ?if broad knowledges let you discover new things and follow one programe without doing any choice .on the contrary be specialize on a specific subject make you be better on this subject like a professional and not losing your time .broad knowlwdge make you dicover new things in some case , and maybe , things that you never imagine you could be interested in , maybe one can find its vocation .moreover , it can be usefull for your own culture to know about the story of your country or about what is happening in your body , even if you will not be an historian or a biologist .in addition , the fact that you do nt have any choice of classes subjects to make like in high school , helps people who do nt know what to do .that it s what happened with some of my friend .on the other side , be specialize on a specific subject can prepare you for your professional life , and with this solution you are only doing things you like or things that you want to know about .therefore people do nt have the feeling to lose there time because they are doing this in order to be an expert and to find a job which deals about the subject .to my mind it is better to have a broad of knowledge of many subject because i am really curious .i will borrow me being only specialize in one topic .i like to learn about many things it makes me feel more inteligent .
