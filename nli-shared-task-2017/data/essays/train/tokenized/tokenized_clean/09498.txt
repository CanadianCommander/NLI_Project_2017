i do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .the first reason is because you could know exactly what is your schedule about time and places .it is important because i could obtain , before the trip , some information which will help me during my tour .for example , if a tour goes through a few museums , i could have information related to artists , paintings and sculptures .it will help me to understand in a better way what things i am discovering and looking at .furthermore i will have a foundation to ask some questions for achieving a deep comprehension .another reason to take a tour is i could take advantage of the trip moment by moment .it permits me to know more new things and cities into a short periods of time .therefore i will not miss any detail of a tour .besides to travel into a group led by a tour is more confortable because i will not be worried of certain facts , as for example : booking hotels , arranging travel tickets , looking for the best transportation ways , contracts , among others .the last reason , and maybe the most important for me , is that this kind of trip allows me to meet other people with the same interests such as to discover new cultures , to admire beautiful cities and countries , and to increase our general knowledge about the world .furthermore i cou a tour guide has a special preparation of several subjects and if we have a question , we will have always his support during the trip .these are important reasons to support why i do not like travel by myself and how much i could enjoy a trip by sharing my time with other people without to be stressed by certain things which could be in the proffesional people s hands .
