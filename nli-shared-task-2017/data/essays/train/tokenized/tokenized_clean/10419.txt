from my point of view , i would say traveling alone is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worry about anything else .traveling alone means , someone is able to go at there own pace , not worry about others , have a good time , meet others and have an alone time .traveling alone is more relaxing , you have no stress , no on etells you what to do .it s also a great experience .you learn on your own , it s always good to have acknowledge other things .if you were to travel with a group led by a tour guide , it would probably not be a good idea , from my personal expereinces .i was to go once with my class to a city called jacmel in port - au - prince haiti led by a tour guide .everyone wanted to do something different .people were getting aggrevated at the tour guide , because she was nt listening to what we wanted to do .but her job was to show us around , but she was talking more then showing .it was nt a great expereince .although , we actually did have a good time together my friends and i , because we were togther an das a class trip that s what we wanted .fro all the class to go somewhere and saty together .our goal was accomplished .from my own experiences , i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .maybe if i were to travel in a group it would have been different then with a tour guide , because you are to do what a tour guide does .and personally , i usually hate when someone tells me to do something , i get vexed .traveling alone is a better idea , because of many reasons .when traveling alone , you do nt have any responsibilities , but only yourself , which is a huge burden of a shoulder .experiencing , visiting , learning alone is great , no one bothers you and you do nt get annoyed , and i belive that is a great way to travel , with no stress , it s all about having a good time , relaxing and having no worries .
