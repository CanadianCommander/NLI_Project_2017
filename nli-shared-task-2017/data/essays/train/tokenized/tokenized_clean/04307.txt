most of the people love travelling in order to discover new places , to rivisit places that they already know and maybe experience them in a new , different way , or just in order to relax by the beach .some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , some other people prefer to just buy a book , read something about the place they re headed to and go by themselves .personally , i prefer to travel by myself , or with a few friends but absolutly without a tour guide .sure an organized trip is really nice but personally i do nt like the idea of jumping on a bus with people i do nt know and with a tour guide telling me all the time what to do , where to go and why .i d rather drive with a few friends , a map and the idea to discover the true reality of the place we are going to visit .i like this way of travelling because i think i d feel more free to organize my trip as i really want to .the fact that i m not interested in being on a bus with people i do nt know might seem a little bit close minded and i would nt want it to be misleading .it s not that i do nt like meeting new people but if i go to a new place i d like to get in touch with local people in order for me to understand their culture , traditions , habits .waht i m looking for while travelling is a full immersion in a new , different reality from which i want to learn .i do nt like much the idea of a tour guide because i think he or she will show me the most famous tourist destinations without really entering the culture itself .all and all i can say that travelling is great either way .i like to travel the way i described because i believe it really help us open up our horizons to different realties .italian food is great - i m italian so . . !- but if i went to marocco , i d rather try cous cous than go the italian restaurant and italian resort where there is nothing about the local culture .
