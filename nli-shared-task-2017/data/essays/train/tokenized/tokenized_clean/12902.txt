i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons .first , if we put importance on learning facts , it tends to produce people who think the result is always the most important .for example .i used to think that the english ability test such as toefl is the genuine reflection of one s english capability .based on this notion , i tend to judge how people i know is fluent in english by asking his/her test scores .in addition , i was easily dissapointed or overjoyed upon my result of the scores , because i tended to think my test score would determine my english fluency .as i constantly get higher and satisfing scores , i reached the conclution that i had enough skills to handle english , and stop studying .however , i found out my perception was wrong .there is no limit , or end for studying langage and it is more important to try hard or make effort , than making good result , because those processes can tell us essential lessons , such as importance of being humble or keeping high motivation all the time .plus , since i have been living in the states , i recognized how my english level is not sufficient to call it enough .therefore , putting more emphasis on learning facts has the risky effect that make people think the result is the most important .second , if we try to understand ideas and concepts , better than to learn facts , we are likely getting more innovative and flexible way of thinking , or seeing the objects .the ideas and concepts are filled with great experiences , or lessons by our ancestor .for instance , the japanese car is said to be excellent in its quality .this is the fact .however , none of the good lessons or experiences can be leaned from the fact .on the other hand , if we try to learn its ideas or concepts which lead the japanese car makers suceed , we can learn benefitial informaion to us , such as how dillidency is important , or how teamwork is important .thus , i strongly agree with the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
