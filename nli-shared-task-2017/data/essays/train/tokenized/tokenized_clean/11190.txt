is it more important to understand concepts than learn facts ?this question is mainly about the opposite educative systems in the world .anglophone countries such as england or the united states give more importance to facts whereas french educative system highlights the major role of concepts .the french educative system is well kown for the large set of concepts you have to learn before being able to practice .teachers evaluate one s ability to increase its theorical knowledge rather than the way he performs .this system allows students to understand all phenomenons and to konw how they work .for instance , comparing the french set of laws to the english one underlines the major differences between learning concepts or facts .in the french code of rights , numerous articles are written in order to take into account all citizen behaviors .on the contrary , the english legal system focus on reals cases that happened in the past .this lead me to the second part of my study .to contrast , anglophone countries believe in the pratice .in universities for example , students work on case study more than on concept .they consider that student will better react to their environment if they have already experienced all alternatives .in my opinion , i agree with the angliophone educative system and with the importance to learn facts rather than concepts .i consider that our future life will be full of positive or negative experiences and that we will need prior experiences to reference to .as wll as i am concerned about education , i would say that french system should take example of the english system .
