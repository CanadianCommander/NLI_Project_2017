i agree with this statement , but students should also understand the facts .students should undertstand the ideas and concepts of the subject what they learn becuase they will not be able to comprehend what the subject is explaining .however , the best way to learn is students should also learn the facts .they must learn the ideas , concepts , and the facts .first example is when students were reaserching for the famous black people from history , students must understand the ideas and concepts of their reaserch .then , they would be willing to study about the people from black history .after they finished reaserching about black people , the teachers should give the comments about their projects .then , students would understand what they missed from their the information about black people .second example is when students need to solve the math word problem .students who do not like the math will not concentrate during the math class .therefore , the math teachers must explain the concepts of learning math .then , the teachers should let the students to think about the math problem and find the answers first .it is important to let the students to think about the problem first and teach students the facts of the problems later .third example is when students were trying to get the solution of the chemistry problem .the quick way to get the answer is just ask to the teachers , but that is a bad idea for students .students must understand the idea of the chemistry and students will be able use this idea and figure the other problems .then , students should check with their teacher what the students got from their understanding .as you read , these are the examples that students should underdtand the ideas , concepts , and facts .the important point of learning for students is to try to figure the problems themselves , but if they can not get the solution , they need to understand the ideas and concepts .then , stundents would eventually comprehend the facts .
