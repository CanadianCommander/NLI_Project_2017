i think that it s not possible to state which is , between a broader knoledge and a more specialized knowledge , the most useful and the most correct at all .however , as a student in business administration i tend to believe that a wider prospective on the knowlegde issue may definitely help .first of all let  s consider the working environment : nowadays people tend to change more and more often their job , following the labour markets that demand flexibility and adaptation skills .a broader prospective allows people to be faster in such an important change as a new job is , preventing them to suffer from frustration and from the sense of inadequacy towards their new employment .this argument is by the way supported by the researches of a famous italian professor , gianmario verona , senior lecturer at bocconi school of managment , as he claimed that innovative companies tend to employ people who show `` t  skills : the vertical part of the `` t  represents the knowlegde of a specific subject , but the horizontal part reminds to the need for broad skills , that the employee is supposed to spend to understand the company strategy as a whole .moreover , even in more simple contexts a wide knowledge is useful ; for example let s consider interpersonal relationships , of any kind .a broader knowledge positively affects the ability to join actively any discussion and results in a more interactive attitude of the person .
