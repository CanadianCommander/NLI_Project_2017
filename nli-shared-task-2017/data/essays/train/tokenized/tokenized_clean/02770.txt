some people may feel that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and some may believe that successful people do not try new things and take risks , they just stick to things they can do well .however , i strongly believe that successful people are innovative and have the risk taking ability .i feel that successful people do take risks .business is another name of risk .profitability depends on the amount of risk taken .the more the risk , the better the profit .however , the risks should be calculated and should be evaluated carefully .successful people do not take blind risks .little bit of risk is everywhere .when we buy shares of a company we are subject to some risks .even the movie actors may take risks in order to satisfy their audiences .a very good example is doctor amitabh bachan .he is a superstar in bollywood .he took a risk by changing his image of an angry young man to that of a comedian by performing some comic roles .he did this to prove himself as a versatile actor .today he is praised for his successful attempts .innovation is important to expand the business .in the world of competition , it is necessary to be innovative , it is necessary to try something and create something new .technological growth , cut throat competition , changing preferences and tastes of the customers make it necessary for any organization to be innovative .successful business man mr.dheerubhai ambani was innovative .his story of rags to riches is very popular among people .his innovative ideas contributed to his success .he was the person who first introduced the concept of public shares in india .his decision made him a millionaire later .in conclusion , i would like to say that successful people do take risks and are innovative .however , their moves are planned .they take calculated risks .so in order to be successful one needs to be innovative and should have the risk taking attitude .
