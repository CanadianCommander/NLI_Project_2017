this is a very difficult question which can not be answered in one strict way .in my opinion there is no general right or no to answer this question , it depends on the situation .to answer this question it is important to see it from different points .on one hand it is good to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .for undergraduates its better to have a main idea about different topics to see what they are interested in .without this knowledge it is impossible to decide which subjects you want to take in the further studies .but not only for the academic career a wide range of knowledge is important .to understand connections between different subjects or to understand social problems it is necessary to have an general idea about several academic points .there is one more point in favour of a broad knowlege i want to mention .if your academic subject you are an expert in , is no longer something which is important to work at , maybe because computers can do all these things instead of human beeings , than you have to watch for a new job in a different field of work .in this situation experiences in different subjects will be a great advantage .on the other hand , as an graduate student you need very specific knowledge about one subject .if not , about what will you write your final exams ?for which job advertisements will you apply ?both are impossible things without a good knowledge about a specific topic .in nearly every exam during your studies , except you are studying something really general , you need specific and deep knowledge about one topic .all in all i would say it is important to have both , general knowledge in different academic subjects and special knowlege in one subject .there is one thing we should ever think about when we discuss this question .you can not get deep knowlege in a subject before having a general idea about it .
