i do not agree with the this statement because younger and older people have different ways to enjoy life .life is not about age whether is a young person or an older person , but instaed about symbolism of joy is a way of enlightment and reach happines .younger people might think or have the idea that they are only ones to enjoy life , but at what cost .older people instaed , have the treasure of wisdom among knowleg , with a convination of lots of experince , they have the mature and most important quality , patience .i have seeing older people enjoying life more then yunger people , but also , comes to a cost of good health .i have see many older people that enjoy life as if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person .to me , life enjoiment is long term learning experience that bring individuals to understand the meaning of enjoyment of life .when one is young , one can think that they have the energy to impose them selves to the world that they are indestructible and this might bring to a short end of life .a few years ago , i was talking to an old friend , he told me one important thing that marked my life for good : `` the diable is not smart because is the diable , is because the diable is old  ; is like the young or old wine , or like the age of the wiesky , whats it is better an 8 year old wiesky or an 24 year of aged in a barril , i would go for the 24 year old aged in a barril .for many things , as children one learn patience by trying to create something maybe a small plaster figure or a carbing on wood , but as learning , it takes time to develop and to evolbe .this is why it does takes time to go trough school first in kindergarten , then into elementary following to middle school , and high school and later college where education teach us that for anything to mature , it does takes time .and because of i beleive that one needs to mature some how and reach and state of aging and would enjoy life as everyday should be , a joyful development .because of this many observations , i beleive that younger people would need time to evolbe and reach maturity to be able to enjoy life in a more passionate way .
