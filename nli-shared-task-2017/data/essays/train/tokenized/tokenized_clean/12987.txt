i will be discussing the question whether young people do enjoy life more than older people do .i do think that this question can be answered on a variety of levels and i will try to state my opinion on this topic .young people have a lot of possibilities in life .most of them have a lot of friends , quite some spare time and a lot of different hobbies and occupations .they can always travel to new places , move around with ease and connect to other young people fairly easily .also , our society offers a lot of different ways for young people to enjoy life , they can be with their friends , they can go to the disco or visit concerts and a lot of media such as computer games and current popular music are designed specifically for younger people .for old people however , there are nt as many viable opportunities .they tend to have fewer friends and a very different style of enjoying themselves .a lot of them have to work quite a lot , not leaving too much time for themselves .they are also usually bound to their hometown , it is where their house is , where their work is and where their children might go to school .all of that does nt really enhance their flexibility too much .nonetheless , they can still enjoy themselves and they can do so on a different level .it seems just by comparing what is offered today , that it is much easier to enjoy life when you are young , but that does nt necessarily hold true .a lot of young people feel the constant need to go to different places and to always have something going on around them .while older people can deeply enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good conversation with a friend , young people often have trouble enjoying anything very deeply .since there is always a lot going on , they also ca nt really appreciate what they have and what they can do .young people also have constant worries about their own future , about relationships and about what will happen to them in their life .all of these worries do in a way prevent them from truly and deeply enjoying something good that happens to them .older people are often a lot more content with their own life , have accepted their fate and can therefore enjoy their pleasures in life more deeply .so in conclusion , young people seem to have endless possibilities and seem to enjoy life a lot more on the surface , but since they have a much harder time to really enjoy what they have , i would nt say that older people have less enjoyment in life .of course it always depends on the individual and there are many cases where a such general rule simply does nt apply , but overall i do nt think that the amount of enjoyment can be evenly compared .both sides can enjoy life a lot , but they do it so differently that i feel this statement can neither be agreed to , nor proven to be wrong .
