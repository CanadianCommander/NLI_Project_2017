enjoyment is a positive feel that a person relishes , and each person has a different perception of enjoyment and has a different way to enjoy his life .there can be different people who enjoy harassing people or some some other ways which may seem absurd to other people .the term joy is totally related with the personality of the person having it .the statement given is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .the first thing to state about the statement is that it is not a universally valid statement that absolutely can not be applied to every person .when a person is young and wants to enjoy by spending most of his time partying around but has severe work load and is not able to alot any time for his enjoyment , this means that , though he is young he is not position to enjoy , while he is still young , and if he thinks that he will enjoy when he is older , after the retirement then he will not have the physical strengh required to enjoy the way he wanted to enjoy .when the same person enjoys doing his work then he has all his time to enjoy and will enjoy much more during strenous work times .it may not seem appealing that a person even enjoys the strenous work but it is analogous to the state of a person who dances in a party though it is physically strenous .when it comes to the older people some people prefer to live in peace which means that they can enjoy the state of being peaceful .some may want to achieve what they have lost during their young age , but it may not be possible at that age , when they are physically disabled to do any strenous work .finally i would like to conclude that enjoyment depends on the way an induvidual perceives it and is totally independent of age age factor .
