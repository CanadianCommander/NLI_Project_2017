many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .after weighing the pros and cons , i will argue in favour of this opinion .first of all , i believe it is necessary to mention the main purpose of an advertisement : it is used to sell a product .in that way , the advertisement has to be original , that is what i personally think , colorful to involve people to pay attention to it and to the product , and sometimes humouristic .today , there are a lot of agencies which create advertisements .thanks to the development of computer , the agencies can use new efficient techniques to launch an attractive ad .but they do not care about the truth . ..secondly , the message said in the advertisement is also very important .for instance , agencies try to prove that without this product you can no longer live !you must absolutely buy it !they also aim to prove with a well-invented sentence that the product is not expensive when referring to its incredible advantages !a message that i really hate is the following : `` more white than white  .naturally it is used to describe the effect of a powder .i can not help thinking that such an ad is a lie .in this case , the advertisement makes the product much better than it really is . ..i find useful to underline that a great number of `` discount products  in supermarkets have a very good taste , for instance , and yet have not necessary been the object of an ad .after closely examining the abose arguments , it is clear that i do not agree with everything created by advertising agencies .yes they have to develop a good image of the product , but unfortunately , it goes too far .i like watching ads on tv or even in the street , but i always be reluctant to buy products whom ad seems to exagerate .
