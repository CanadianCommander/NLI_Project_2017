in the past 10 years , i have traveled in my own country and in all over the world .the best trip was going to australia by myself in my early 20 s .it was my first traveling oversea .and i enjoyed to experience the new world .there was only once that i traveled in a group by a tour guide which was one of the high ivents .i had a lot of fun with traveling in a group though , but now , as i am looking back to the old memories , i do not agree that the best way to travel in a group by a tour guide .there are two reasons why i would rather traveling by myself than taking a group tour .they are feeling freely to plan my own trip and spending time and expence as i want .first of all , i do not want to go a place where i am not even interested in visiting .i would like to plan my trip for just for myself , to visit how , or where i want to go .another reason why i want to travel alone is that i do not want to spend time and money to go , or to watch thing .it is a very precious and limited time when i decide to travel .for those reasons why i do not agree with the statement are feeling free to plan my trip and spending time for myself that the best way to travel is in a group bt a tour guid .
