the issue at hand is whether or not is necessary to take risks to succeed in life .i think this is a very important issue because it has to do with our personal behaviour and most of all with the way everybody looks at life in general .i am convinced that the only way to have success is to take risks and to try to walk roads that nobody walked before .my first reason to support my thought is my own experience .when i finished the university in florence , i decided to come to mexico because i was convinced that i would have greater opportunities to realize my dreams than if i had remained in italy .i took the risk to go to a new country but today i can say that it worths .another reason why i think risk is strictly correlated to success is because i am convinced that all the ways that take you to success must be difficult .as much your dream is bigger as much it will be more difficult to realize .but difficulty naturally implies risk , because without taking any risk things are much easier to realize , but also they give you less success .of course not everybody likes to take risks .as i mentioned before it depends on our personal behaviour .on one hand there are some people that enjoy life without taking any risks , following a routine that they already know very well .on the other hand there are some people that look at life as a continous change , as taking risks all the time .i think i belong to the second group of people as i get bored very easy when i am doing the same things .for all these reasons i conclude that people who think of success as the main goal of their lifes , must take risks and trying new things as many times as they can .the bigger the risk , the greater the success .
