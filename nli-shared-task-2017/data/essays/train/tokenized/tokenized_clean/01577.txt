young people enjoy life more than old people because they don t have health problems as many as old people do .while we are getting old we loose most of our abilities like ; hearing , seeing far or close objects , if we are unlucky , walking and many like these .most of the old people that we know takes medicine in order to regulate the ordinary and normal body conditions for example ; my grandmother takes pills in order to regulate her heart beats and grandfather of mine takes medication to avoid his blood presure increase abnormaly .i hear their complains about these problems every single day .most of the time , i think the only thing that can be spoken to an old person is heath problems or medicine .after getting retired , seeing their childrens weedings , having decreased on the abilities that they used to have , the thing they expect from their own life becomes just dieing in peace , and i think this is the most significant idea of many old people .i witneesed it from my grandparents and their friends who are over 60 years old .on the other hand , i also know a lot of young people who has no health problem and who are very happy with their lives .enjoying the life despite some other problems which old people don t have after their retirements as ; earning money , affording a good life , hard work conditions , is still possible for them because they don t have to worry abour their health .most of the young friends i know care about their lives in order not to be like their parents , complaining all the time about doctors or the que at the hospital .they go to sport centers , take long holidays , travel to other countries , go to picnic , try different types of sports , becomes a member of a club . ..so they also consider that not only being young , but also staying healthy is necessary .in my opion , young people who knows how to enjoy life and keeps their health as long as possible , accomplishs to enjoy life more than unhealthy old people do .
