in spite of the general economic developpment of most of the people on the planet allowing more and more citizens to earn their own car , the lack of petroleum could also stop the increasing growth of production of cars worldwide .petroleum is not an infinite ressource , and gasoil is made of it .everybody knows that there will no longer be available petroleum in fifty years !this idea conveys a surrounding concern for environmemt , the protection of our planet and the preservation of our energetic ressources .in order to concretize these ideas , people started already to share cars , as they share flats .sharing cars prevents from economic and energetic wasting .citizens are encouraged to take public transports such as buses or metropolitan instead of using their cars for short distances .scientists also lanched researched to find some ways to replace cars , or at least replace gasoil .but we can not deny that the general economic developpment encouraged by liberalism and globalization allows more and more people to own their cars .in this generalized consumer society , people can easily be lent some money to buy more and more consumer goods , such as cars .the globalization launched as well an increase in communications all over the world .commercial exchanges , and new communication medias such as phones or the internet seem to be in their golden age .humans are developping a new way of living based on flexibility and mobility in which cars are absolutely necessary .a major americam research center published a theory about what the world would become in the next decades .it states that human are unaware of their wasting petroleum , and that they will be unable to prevent the lack of it .the study predicts the fall of globalization : people will have to save on transport to spare some gasoil , and local marked will dramatically increase .all economic activities will return to their geographic origin and teare will no longer be delocalisations .up to my opinion , i donnot share such a radical point of vue but i agree that people should save on petroleum .i predict that more and more exchange will use medias .people will not have to move to meet others or even to work .people will use the internet to work at home , organizing meetings with their colleagues .i think that , besides the decrease in the use of cars in the next two decades , there will be an expand of individuality and a loss of humanity .
