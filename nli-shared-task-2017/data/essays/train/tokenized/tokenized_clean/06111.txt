it is often said that these days young people do nt spend enough time to be concerned about their communities .some people might agree with this statement because many young people become selfish because of the internet .however , i am strongly against the idea of youngster s indifference about their communities because they are insighting the homepage of communities and help the lonely old people .to begin with , the young in modern society are interested in the way how the community behaves in the area .it is commonly observed that many young people post claiming writinga in the board of community .accordingly it is a myth that nowadays youngsters care only about themselves .for example , june kim , one of my friends , has one son , who is 8 years old .when he went to his son s school , he realized that the lunch menu was too bad for children to take .as soon as he came home , he began to write the the principal of the school about this , and the lunch menu has been changed .in addition , many young people have accustomed to helping people .it is obvious that when many school gives the students class score according to how often they help the poor people or weak people , students are willing to help people .consequently , many young people help people without hesitation due to the habit in the school .for example , my son is elementary student .i had never taught him to yield the seat to the old , but in a bus , when an old person got on the bus , my son quickly stands up and guides him or her to his seat .i was really proud of my son .in brief , i firmly believe that the young already know how to participate in the community and how to help their communities .thr
