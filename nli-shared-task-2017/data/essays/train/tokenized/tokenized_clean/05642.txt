it is often said that eoungh time to helping their societies was not given to young poeple in modern society .some poeple might think young poeple did not spend their time to do something for their communities , in terms of their lots of work to do .however , i disagree with the idea that young poeple do not spent their time helping their societies because of the importance of volenteering activities , and the importance of guarding society .to begin with , the significant of volenteer work are oncreasing these days .it is obvious that volenteer activities are a mendatory for university students to get a job .for examples , the ministry of labor in korea resarch the importance factor that company select the person .accordong to their resarch , activeties for their communities are almost doubled than their scores in university .from this atmosphere of the sociey encourages young poeple spend their tome for their communities .in addition , young poeple realize that we can not maintain our lives without helping each other .it is commonly observed that the crime rate are incresing in modern society .this risks give rise to the changes that young poeple think they are the poeple who gurad their communities by themselves .for instance , my village can prevent the crimes thanks to the young poeple security club s activeties .they , include i , guard my village in turns respectively every once a month .in conclusion i firmly believe that young make an effort to thier societies in terms of the atmosphere of modern society , and their won idea for guarding their communities .
