the statement is about , whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to have specialize konowledge in one particular subject .i prefer to have specialize knowledge in one particular subject rather than having broad knowledge on many subjects .if we concentrate on one subject specifically it will be very much useful for us so that we can know every thing about that subject perfectly .if we have knowledge on one particular subject it would very easy for us even to find jobs related to that subject .it will also help us to become a proffesional in that particular subject .generaly it is not that much easy for any one to concentrate on all the other subjects and acquire broad knowledge about them .if weconcentrate on subjects related to computer we can decide the way to which we should go that is you will have an idea to apply for the jobs related to computer rather than applying for any other field .suppose if i we have knowledge on both elctronics and computers we will be in a dilema situation whether to apply for a computer job or electronic jobfor example i like mathematics a lot from my primary education .i used to get the top mark in mathematics every time .when i joined my engineering i used to concentrate on electrical subjects .as a result i found realy difficult to pass mathematics during my graduation , this because i tried to to have knowledge on many subjects related to electronics .as i tried to gain knowledge on elctronics subjects i was unable to concentrate on the subject which i used to have knowledge earlier and i even lost my knowledge on that subject .so i strongly support to concentrate one particular subject rather than on trying to have a broad knowledge on many other subjects .the main disadvantage of trying to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects is we will be realy diificult to choose our profession that is if you concentarte only on mathematics you can known as an mathematician .wheras if try to gain knowledge on all academic subjects no one can say what you are , i mean whether you are mathematicin or an engineer or an doctor .by attempting to have knowledge on all subjects you may even loose the knowledge about the subject which you have greater control .so it would be better if we have broad knowledge on one particular subject than having knowledge on many subjects .it will save your time , helps you to choose the perfect path which you are interested in and will leave a satisfactory feeling for you .
