for long as the college exsits in the society , the professors and students have debated whether having many academic knowledge would be better or having spacialize ones .the issue may not be resolved be everybody s satisfaction the answer is crystal-clear in my mind ; taking many academic subjects will be the best for your edcucation .that many academic subjects are better for education is eveident for several reasons .first , when you are educated in school or some institute , in most cases the studenets goal in the future are vague .in this kind of situatiation the students will need variety of informations which lead his future to be very attractive .to illustrate , my sister who is in college have not decided her job after school .however she is now taking the many academic class to broaden her knowledge and also make herself well-balanced charactor which will lead for her future goals .second , by taking many academic subjects you will get to know with varaiety of freinds whose background and thoughts are different .for example , the college i had graduate offers many academic subjects in freshman .after ten years has past , the friends i got in that timing are still very good friends and influenced me .nevertheless , some critics may contend that specific subjects will be more effective to edcucate the workers for specific jobs such as lawyer , enginner , physicia among others .however , recent graduate school recrute more well-balanced students from other areas .my brother who had been working as a sales rep for computer finally could get in to graduate school for doctor .they requires the applicants who have taken many academics subjects from under graduate schools and can talk and listen with his patients very carefully .in view of this to take many academic subjects overweigh the experience to take specialize ones .in conclusion .manay academic subjects will make the person to have more potential to reach and decide he/her goal as well as providing well balanced personality that recently requires as a matured adult in whatever jobs in society .
