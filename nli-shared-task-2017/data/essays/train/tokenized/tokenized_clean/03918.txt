nowadays , the world is getting closer and closer .people want to travel around in their holidays .though we can travel without tour guide at any place , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first , one of the reason why we travel is to experience new circumstances and environments .so , we can face some difficulties and dangers while we are travelling .if there is a tour guide around , we can escape those dangers effectively .second , tour guides are specialists who know well about the tourist attractions and famous places of the area .so , we can see around as many places as we can with the guide of the tour guide .usually we do not have enough time to travel the whole region .under the time limit , we can travel more effectively with the tour guide .third , if we travel in group with many people , we can share information and talk together .if we are lucky , we can make friends and keep in touch with the person after the travel .as for me , i love to meet other people and share thoughts with them .thus , i would travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling alone .there are also many good points of travelling without tour guide .we can make the itinerary on our own and that could be a pleasure for us .also , we can get time to think about ourselves while travelling alone and can get deep understanding of ourselves .but , i would rather choose to travel with a professional tourguide because there are more strength points than travelling without tourguide .
