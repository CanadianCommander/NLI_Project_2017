i do think , that successful people are tending to take risks and trying new things .if one is successful in working , then he or she gets work faster and more effective done than others .what does this one do with the remaining time , while the others are still working ?first the one would try to redo work to do it in a better way of quality .second he would tend to do different things like gathering with collegues or flirting with a woman .in this case he would loose the enhance of flirting or gathering , because it would not be , what he is satisfied by .third thing that would happen , is one would tend back to his work and do what he is payed for .evaluating his work would lift him up in a position above his collegues and in conclusion the one would be miscredited .at the end he would spend at least a part of his time in doing new things and in taking risks .in my example , a person is automatically brought up to try new things and to take risks , because he is better than the others .it could be a member of a company .thinking about a more daily term makes the statement common .everywhere in the world people tend to do things that makes them different to other people .if you take a group of children for example , that are playing with a doll , then after a while of being involved , one of them leaves the group in the meaning of playing with a ball .ther is and there will always be one out of a group , who is leaving or who is going to take a risk .almost everyone in society has got a special thing of doing .people are bungee jumping or are holding on to a farm with ten horses although its a lot of work to do .these are supposed to be examples of peoples privacy .they all tried something risky in times , when they started with this special kinds of sports or private activity .probably there have been relatives in any of this examples , that were wondering about the risk part of the activity .
