everyone wants to be successfull .however cooking a pitza is not a success .the question is ` which accomplishment is a success ?` .an accomplishment is called success when it is something rare .success comes from trying and working for new , risky and higher level accomplishments .first of all , a successfull person can not be the model of an old successfull person .for example an architect builds an extra-ordinary building and create a new approach which is second to none in his area .an other architect reads many articles about the above mentioned approach and builds a new building with the same style , or approach .which one would you like to call successfull ?of course the first one .secondly , accomplishing something which is already accomplished by someone else is not success .take the risk and try something harder !as an example , one racer finishes the race in 5 minutes .if the other one want to be successfull then he should risk his life and drive faster .moreover , in pc games the player is only successfull when he or she reaches the top score , which means he or she is better than the last player .in contrast , some lazy people argues that doing the thing they know the best is the success .i call them robots .do you see any difference ?robots are doing what they can do the best .they are of course successfull in being a robot , however not a successfull human .all in all , in my opinion there is a big difference between success and accomplishment .success is the new , risky and top level accomplishment .only doing what you already know how to do is next to nothing .
