in my opinion , i agree that it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .this is not only because the generation we live is an infromation bombing generation , but also because if we can have broad knowldege of many academic subjects we can see this world in different ways .according to some data , there are thousans of new information created every second , that is why we feel time is lost so quickly .though we ca nt read or experience every new creations , we still need to try , otherwise , we wo nt get up with the world .take my mother for example , she is a principle of junior high shcool , she is not very good at the new technic material .every time she wants to add a new cell phone number into her cell phone , she needs asking me to help her .one day , she had to manage a new shool , and she would like to make a website to introduce her new school .i think she worked very hard on this , and then she made it .she made a very beautiful and praticle website on her own ; of course she asked many people for this .after this event , i admire her more over .on the other hand , my father is a teacher , too .two years ago , he retired , and finally he could go back to farm as he wich .compared with my mother , he rather grows some vegetable than to learn new techonic .until now , he ca nt do something with the computer by himself , although he always says he would like to do that , and of course it never happened .i do nt mention that my father is useless , but if he could try and learn more about new subjects , i think his life will be easier and independable .i know there maybe some people think that it is enough for us to specialize in one specific subject , but i suggest them to look forward to the real world .we can find new things every day , and we should handle those new things , either .if we would like to have a various kinds of life , it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects .
