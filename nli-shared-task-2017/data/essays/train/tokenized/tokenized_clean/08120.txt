it is evident from histories and successful people lives that doing something new and taking risks has always resulted in sucess .one should believe that doing an ordinary thing is not appreciated .every one considers it as a job or part of a job .only extraordinary things which raises others eyebrows are appreciated and rewarded .this happens only if someone tries to do something new or something different .this definately is achieved by taking a risk .inventions like television , communication system like telephone are the results of sucessful people .if they have done their normal routine jobs they might not have invented all these .they have taken risks and tried to do something new .thats the reason they are suceessful .we can quote research scholars and people working on new topics as an example .they are doing something new by taking risks .due to their efforts we are seeing many advanced and surprising products , inventions , drugs etc .if we compare us with our granfathers lot has changed .they used to move from place to place by means of animals whereas we are travelling in air , by road , trains and on water .our grandfathers havent dreamt of all these .all these are the inventions of successful people .they acheved by trying something new and taking risks .people do their routine jobs .they may succeed by doing the job with perfection which is considered as a job or a part of the job .what are they succeeding ? .if someone does the same job or same step in less time or with increased productivity than there is success in it .the success can be achieved only if he tries to do in a different way .doing a routine job in a different way alwasys involves risk .hence i strongly agree with the opinion that successful peple try new things involving risks rather than only doing what they know how to do with perfection .
