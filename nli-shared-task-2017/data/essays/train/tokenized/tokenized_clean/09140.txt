helping people is one of the most important things everyone should do during his/her life .we all know what happened in the past and what is happening now in wars that only take death and disaster .it s fundamental to try to think about it because we can understand what are the consequences of hate and interests in money .unfortunately they lead people not to consider the relationship with others even if it is one of the best things you can experience .i will explain why young people do nt give time to helping other people and i will say my idea on it .first , we can asses how they spend their time .they are interested in playing with their friends , having an expensive car and going out in the evening abusing alchol and drugs .this problem can be found in the society that send that kind of massages through internet and the television .second , it s important to consider the family in which everyone grows .in my opinion , the role of the parents in helping their children in their decisions and giving them suggestions about their problems is crucial .i am lucky because i always had a good relationship with my parents .
