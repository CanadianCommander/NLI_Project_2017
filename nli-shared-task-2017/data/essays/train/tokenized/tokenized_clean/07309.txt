in our modern time of new ways of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisements than it really is .lets take for example a pencil which is praised to be of very high qualitiy at tele-shopping , of course for a low price .the costumer will pick up the telephone and order this lovely pencil .two weeks later he got the small packet with the little pencil in it and he ca nt wate to open it .still he thinks he made a good deal with what he bought on tv , very practical and easy buying .but what happens in the end ?the colour of the pencil is blue instead of black as it was shown on tv .the writing is not that lovely as it was described in the advertisment .what now ?big disappointment .as we see in this little example the new medias have the power to manipulate the costumer in a way he does not even take note of it .the composion of the light in which the product is recorded , or the frame in which it is showed can make it seem bigger , smaller , nicer etc .for the costumer it is hard to imagine how the product looks like in reality .this kind of manipulation bz making things appear better than thez really are is a profession for itself , in that way one can imagine how effective these tools must be .conclusona ; in may opinion in many cases the original product is very different in aspect and quality so that one has to be carefull with too fast decisions about buying a product .it is always better to put down the glasses of advertisments and look with zour own eyes
