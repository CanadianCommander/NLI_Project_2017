`` if one knows all , he knows none .all around the world there are people trying to do all the things they want to do , and causing other people of that expertise to be unemployed .if a person is a professional in his or her expertise then this person should try to be useful for global researches about that expertise .in other words , a person should not be trying other things than he is a professional on , but be the best in his own expertise .in my country , turkey , there are many people who are trying to be the best in everything .for example , there are a lot of models who are trying to be singers or actors .this causes the true singers to fade in the business in time .not only models , but many celebrities are doing the same too .we have an author who also , tried to be the governer of istanbul .not that he would not be a great governer , but he is an artist , he should do his art .if a person is succesful in his or her business or area of expertise , he or she should try to help the worldwide researches about his or her topic .the sharing of ideas would bring better solutions to the problems of the world .i believe that china is in a great position to support my thesis .in china , people are doing the things they have to do and they all think that their job is a `` great job  for them .this may be a hasty generalization , but china s improvement throughout 21st century proves this statement .if everyone does his or her own job , then every job gets to be the `` great job  .while concluding my words i would like to state my future plans about this statement .i will try to be a professional in my area of expertise and try to share my knowledge with the world by all means .this should be the plan for all to achieve great developments .
