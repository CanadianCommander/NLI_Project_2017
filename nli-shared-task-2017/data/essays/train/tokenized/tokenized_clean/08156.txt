i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think that young people today are less involved in community activities and spend less time there because the society in common became more individualistic .for instance , a lot of young people today perform individial sports or they perform sports only occassionally .it is no longer common that such people are organised in sports clubs and take responsibily as team coaches or in training kids and younger club members from their community .it seems also that organisations like the boy scouts or churches have a problem to attract young people .and i think that young people were more politically engaged in previous times .there are only few young people nowadays joining political parties or labour organisations such as union .in particular , most young people are reluctant to take political positions on a communal level because they can no see any sense in it .one reason seems to be that the economic situation has changed much over the last years .the pressure to be successfull in the job is much higher than ever before , and the high unemployment rate threatens a lot of people because of their proffesional future .hence , young people are urged to finish their school time time and studies as fast as possible which leaves only very little time for community activities .in addition , it seems to be more common today to teach competition instead of collaboration , leading to a more egoistic society .a lot of young people start to learn this early in their careers , leaving the impression to them that is not benefitial to take responsibilites in their communities because of the time it costs .finally , the society became more mobile over the last years , which means that in particular young people often change their job and living place .hence , these young people can not really get rooted in a community .but this seems to be a major prerequesite for any community engagement .
