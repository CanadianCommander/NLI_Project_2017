as a senior in high school is sitting in a roon , he is trying to figure out what he wants to become in the future .how does a person decide ?school has given students the opportunity to learn many academic subjects .whether it is math , or chemistry the broad knowledge that it is atteined serves as a help to discover the inner talents and creativity that a person might posess .during senior year , one of the hardest decisions is to pick the major or career one wants to do in college .would it have help is a student only study one specific subject ?is that really the students truly interest ?i am senior in high school .at first all i though i like was math , and all i wanted to do was math .however , the school required some other regular classes and electives .my junior year in high school , i decided to take computer programming and i felt in love with it .then this year i currently have physics and it is like my favorite class in the world .when it came down to make a decision of what i wanted to do with my life , i took all the different classes i took into consideration .since , i had such a broad knowledge of many subjects like math , physics , and computer , i narrow it down to electrical and computer engineering .i am very glad that the school provides such a verity of classes .however , this does nt only apply to education if not to everyday life as well .a person may know how to count and mix chemicals together , but can he or she write a letter ?life does nt rely on one subject , if not on many .it would be very useful to have a least a little bit of knowledge on different types of subjects .with this on mind a person does nt always need to rely on others for help .a chemist can write correct reports .a writer can keep organize his finances .in the end , to go through life it is better to have a broad mind .in conclusion , the study of many subjects gives the choice to experiment different activities , and helps to discover ones interests in life and goals .it is useful on making decisions and surviving life .a broad knowledge is the key to ones inner talents and creations .
