people started to learn in school but after sometime books are not enough .especially for historical places you need to go and see this place to understand and to feel the history better .the question is to go there and discover this place by yourself or go and join a tour and let the gude help you .i prefer going without a tour guide .i have some specific reasons for this .first of all if you go to a place with a tour guide you must always follow him .you can never wait to take some more pictures , look something from a different view .even you can not stop when you are hungry thirsty or tired .because you are not alone and the guide has got a program for this day .it has to be done .also if you go there alone you can discover some other places that are not famous but interesting .at the end of the day you feel very tired because you saw many places bu you never satisfied .also most of the guides has got a style depends on wrong but interesting stories and stupid jokes about everything you saw .espesially when you get on the bus to go some place they take the microphone and they never stop talking .they want to entertain you but these kind of stuff become annoying afterten minutes .you can never look from a window and enjoy the view because you always hear laughs and songs .and at the end when you want to go somewhere with a tour guide it is always two or three times expensive than you go alone or with your friends .and after all when you return from vacation you relaize that you do nt remember anything you do nt have enough souveniours and pictures and you have to go there again .because of all these reasons if you want to see a place think more about this vacation make a good plan with your friends and never add a stranger especially a guide to your plans .
