i agree with the statement .we can see someone who success in his life with pursuing new things and taking risks .we should nt be hang on our usual , binded thinking .creating something gives us successful life , happy emotions , comfortable feeling etc .for example , our lots of equpiment , a computer , an refrigirator , an radio , an television , an laptop , a microwave etc were invented by someone long time ago .if everybody think same thing just like normal people and behave , we do nt live now with convinence .certainly we could nt manage our life just like now .thank to them , we can live comfortably .more and more the age change , we require more comfortable equipment , facility .we ca nt satisfy our reality everytime .so this time , we try to invent making something which will give us peaceful life .sometimes changing thinking accompanies danger .but we should break the nervous feeling , furious feeling .if we want to get innovation about something .besides , the japarody will create an fresh idea .depending upon only donig what i alreay know how to do well wo nt give me a good effect .it will help me just live commonly .so if we feel like thinking of varying , altering , innovating something , we should nt be hesitant to do it .shortly think and do it !there is nothing to do with an great , huge idea to make an new idea .even if it is very simple and look so shabby , it is enough that you think about something by yourself creatively , differently over other people .only , with the reason , you deserve prasie .i think that development is from not an big idea but an new idea .it will be resource .so if we want to alter from out-fashioned to out of stated , we should try to do it .it will lead us to have successful life .
