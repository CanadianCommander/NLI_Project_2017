although many advertisements try to make some products seem better , i do not agree with that they are succesfull .because the advertisements can not hide the reality .also people investigate the products with all details before buying them .it is not very easy to make a product seem much better than they really are .so it may cause some problems which customer complain about .some advertisements may illustrate that their pruducts have awesome results .however , the truth can not be covered forever .if you buy something which promise a good result , you may be disappointed .because you want to see the the results which they offer in their advertisement .when you see the reality which is opposite , you will not suggest this product and it will cause to decrease the number of customers which may want to try it .also many people investigate the products before buying .they read the comments which are about the products and they want to see some formal certificates which guarantee claims of products .so they do not believe easily to advertisements .after they finish their searchings about the products , they pay money for the products .the advertisements are used for informing people about new products and technologies .if advertisements do not reflect the realities , it can cause some problems .it can decrease the reputation of products .so the companies get difficulties to increase their profits .i believe that most people agree with me .since life gets harder and more expensive , people think second time before buying .so the advertisements can not be very efficient if they try to make the products much better .
