nowadays , everyone tries to be successful in his work regardless of what he or she is doing .today different statements exist what can be characteristic for successful people .some people hold the opinion that doing same things the whole time is the best way to be successful .however , in my view , it is sometimes much more better to try new kinds of working .therefore i agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .first of all , i try to give some examples why this point of view is a good way to work .to be a successful person i have to improve my work over time .i can not realize this task with only working in the same way .therefore , it is the best way to try something new .for instance , i try to improve my skills with trying out some new programs for procucing a website .despite it takes much more time to work with a new programm it has also lots of advantages .for example i am able to use different kinds of tools and perhaps i am able to do things which would not be possible for me with the normal program .on the other hand , also some disadvantages has to be considered .first of all , trying new kinds of working can also has some risks .i am not able to know how long time my work will take .furthermore it is not possible to estimate if my work will be really effective .in sum , it is a risk to try out new kinds of working .everyone who wants to be successful should do this not the whole time .it is important to acquire lots of skills , but when you are doing this the whole time there is not enough time to work effective and to be successful with the results of your work .
