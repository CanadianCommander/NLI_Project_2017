the number of cars in use across the world has been growing steadily for the past fifty years , and one might naively expect that the number will keep increasing .however , a more careful examination of the factors that affect the number of cars indicates that over the coming years , it is likely that the number of cars across the world will decline .in particular , improved telecommunication , improved public transport facilities , rising fuel prices , and rising concern for pollution and congestion are likely to lead to a decline in car use .let us first examine some of the causes for the rapid growth in car use in recent times .first , improved technology has resulted in reduced costs of car construction , and increased affluence of people has resulted in greater capacity to purchase cars .second , road networks have permeated cities and villages across the world , hence people are much more tempted to buy cars .however , both these factors might be nearing their saturation point , now that road networks already very extensive and cars are within a range of affordability for many .another important factor in the growth of car use over the last fifty years is the increasingly hurried and rapid pace of life where people are expected to be available at any date , any place and any time .people with the money have often preferred to buy their own cars rather than be at the mercy of erratic public transport .however , the same hurried pace of life may now operate against cars .with improved underground railway networks in major cities , and increased road congestion , many people have started prefering a train or bus commute to driving their own car through traffic .in addition to public transport , many companies and organizations now run transport services for their own employees , which helps promote timeliness as well as discipline among employees .availing such transport facilities frees people of precious time and energy that would have gone into driving .the teenage generation of today has seen the congestion of roads , pollution and rising fuel prices that have been brought about by an overuse of automobiles .when these teenagers grow up and become the working class of society , they will thus keep in mind the adverse effects of car proliferation and many of them may refrain from getting or using their own vehicles .another important factor that will lead to a decline in car use is the rapid growth of telecommunication that will render a lot of transportation irrelevant .today , people can do a lot over email , telephone , instant messaging , and the internet .a person can shop while sitting at home , keep in touch with close relatives , and even participate in live discussions .thus , the need for instantaneous mobility will reduce significantly .to summarize , i feel that car use is likely to decline over the coming years , both due to a recognition of the inherent problems with car proliferation and due to the emergence of viable alternatives for quick transportation and easy accessibility .
