ii do nt agree with the following .is very difficult , in my opinion , think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all we have to consider that there are a lot of countries that are in expansion , countries like china , india , brasil .in this place there is an economic boom that in my opinion will increase a lot the car s production .if we consider that in this countries live 1/3 of the world  s populations , it s simple to think that the use of cars can only increase .another reason cause i do nt agree is that we , and when i say  we  i consider the  rich  world , do nt want to use a different way to move or different solutions instead car .in my own opinion is possible that in twenty years we can find a solutions for the pollution using elettric cars or another ki
