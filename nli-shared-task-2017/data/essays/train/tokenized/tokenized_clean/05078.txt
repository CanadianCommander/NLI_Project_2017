as i am studying business management at the university in bayreuth i am specialized on one specific academic subject .but many people ask me what i would do if i do not get a job in a company or need knowledge of another subject to fullfill a new job .so is it better to have a broad knowlege of academic subjects than to specialize in a specific one ?well , i do not think so .of course , if you have a broad knowledge of different things you are not so much restricted to a certain job .you might know a lot of things other people might not know .nevertheless , what kind of jobs will you get ?maybe you are able to work for a lot of different companies or do something on your own but the jobs you can get will always be in a lower position as you are missing the necessary background information to fullfill the complete range of tasks of this job .one might say that if you are specialized on a certain topic it is hard to get another job .this might be true , but why should you even look for another job ?you are specialised on your subject because you think it is the best for you and you want to spend your lifetime with a job working in this special segment .if you have enough knowlege in your subject you will soon reach a higher position as you have all the necessary background knowlegde to fullfill your entire tasks .people who know more about their segment they are working in have more success and therefor live a happier life .as arthur lassen said : `` nothing will make you happier than to succeed in the things you love .as a conclusion one has to say that specialized knowledge will help you much more to find an apropriate job .even if a broad knowledge could help you in different parts of your life , knowing more about your subject and going below the surface will lead to much more success and maybe even happyness .
