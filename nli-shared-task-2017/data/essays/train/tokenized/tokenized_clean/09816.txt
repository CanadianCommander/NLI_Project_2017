that is true , today the companies use that kind of strategies to convince the customers to buy a product .when the people watch on tv an advertisement about some product they expect that the product would make that they say it makes , but almost all the time it does nt happen .today , it s very common to see in the television and the newspapers too , a lot of things about the diet products .the advertisemnet says that you can left fat in only few weeks and the people belive that , but really it s false .sometimes the companies use a famous actor to represent the product and they show a picture when the actor was fat and now using the product he can have a perfect body .it s very important not believe in all things about a product .it s necesary to make questions and ask for garanties before to take the decision to buy a product .
