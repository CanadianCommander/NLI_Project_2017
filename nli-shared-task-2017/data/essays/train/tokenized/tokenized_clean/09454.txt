the topic given to me is that broad knowledge is better than on the knowledge of a specific subject .i dont agree with the following statement because broad knowledge can not help us always .it is necessary to have a specialised knowledge over a particular subject .by having broad knowledge over many academic subjects can not fetch you in getting a job .this is because the companies want students who were specalised in a particular task for their work .moreover he can not be confident in any of his subjects and face many problems .if we are specalised in a particular subject we can do research in that particular subject and can improve our knowledge .by doing so we can reach great heights in our career .for example if we consider the president of india , he is a great scientist who used to work at isro got great fame because of his sucess in the field he has choosen .we must take him as inspiration and must try to develop in our future .if we try to have knowledge on all subjects than its just like standing on two boats and definetly we have to face many problems in the future .though he is talented he can not reach great heights in his career .he may also face the problem of earning money as he can not get a good job that bears his expenses .for example if i am interested in both science and social it is better to concentrate on only one subjects than the two .this is because if he studies both he can not be a knowledged persons in any of the subjects and and he will come to the stage of confusion to choose which subject for his higher studies .i finally say that it is better to be a leader in one field than to be a member in many fields .so finally i feel that it is better to specalize in one subject due to the reasons given above .moreover by doing so we can be the most knowledable and experienced person in a particular field .
