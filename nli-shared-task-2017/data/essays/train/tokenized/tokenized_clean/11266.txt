broad knowledge of many academic subjects is interesting in order to get a general view on subjects .one is then able to get involved in different matters .the more general view you will have have , the more you will be able to understand other people isssues and what they are concerned of .but by having a view on many subject , you will not be able to masterise them .specializing in one specific subject will allow you to emphasis the subject and develop high quality skills .it then depends what you research .if you know exactly what you want to be doing or that you work on high technicity subjects you will then need to get specialised .if you want to keep an evolution possibility in the subjects you are studying or if you absolutly need a global view on your topic you will then need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .from my point of view , it is necessary to develop a high level of skills .it is to say specialise even if you have to choose between subjects that seem all interesting and challenging .studying geography , maths , physics , litterature or history will require a high level of knowledge and investment that will not allow you to get on several subject .ideally , on a five year academic course , a possible option would be to perform a double study class .at the end you will then be specialized in two complementary subjects such as science and management , geography and economics , business and information technology .
