yes , i agree with statement that young people enojy more than older people .at the young people enjoy lot with the friends by going movies , by parting but the older people as to there work in the office and had to see the family problems , finacial problem and at that they ca nt enjoy .young people will enjoy more because they had no family , finacial problems the only is to study but this is not big problem as they can do by suding before exams until they can play , can do parties , go to movies , can go to tours .as young will not going to come young people remember these things in the old age .example , for the young people enjoy than older is , in school days we did more thing in the school with my friends such as to make jokes and make fun with others but we manage the people whom we make fun atlast .finally , they also does not take seriously and doing this we can get fun a we able recollect these things at the older age .another example is when we tour in school days we miss the way with teachers and we went to another place we had struck there for one day we had enjoy there by missing as we go to different place but fianlly we made our way that our teacher were , this is one which i will not going to forget .by watching movies we can enjoy lot as all the friends will be going to be there .another one where we enjoy is the parties as all friends will gather there an do different things and that joy will be not present in the older people even they do parties , they only can say their problemsfinally , we must enjoy the young age as it will be not going to come again but only the rememberance what we had done in the young age
