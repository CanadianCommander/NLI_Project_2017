enjoying life is altogether a different phenomenon taking into consideration the age of the people .most people enjoy their lives when they are young and tend to become more sober during their later lives .there could be many reasons apart from the age factor that makes people to stop enjoying life when they become old .firstly , i do think that young people enjoy life more that the older people .the reason for this might be that the people are quiet young and energetic and hence tend to explore more things in this world .for example , young people generally like to travel around and see the places they have not visited before .not only with the family but also with their friends .hence those tours are meant for the enjoyment they can derive being with their friends .whereas , older people do not involve in such activities because they may have more responsibilities on their shoulders which the young people may not have .secondly , when people become old , they tend to think more about their offsprings rather than themselves .and also the fact that the people like to look after their grandchildren in their later parts of their lives might deter people from enjoying .whereas , young people when they join their colleges , meet with new friends and tend to learn something from their new lives .this will make them to explore new things and enjoy a little better .apart from all these factors , the most important factor is that the old people are being discarded by their children and being kept in the old age homes where they have very little to enjoy .youngsters , meanwhile enjoy a lot by partying , dancing and hanging out with their friends .to summarize , older people like to relax in their later parts of their lives .they would have also enjoyed when they were young .perhaps , this might be the reason , apart from the energy factor that the young people enjoy their lives more than the old people do .
