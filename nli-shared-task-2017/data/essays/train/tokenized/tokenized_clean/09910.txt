i strongly agree with that statement .in thesedays there is a lot of cars .the number of cars on streets is increasing and we can say each family has at least one car .but after twenty years i think and i hope that there will be fewer cars than now .because twenty years , it might be a short time , but now the speed of develop of science became very fast as well , and i am sure that in our future we will able to do most things of our life and our work at home without moving .so we will not need the car as so many times as now .thanks to especially internet now we can do many things at home .for example we can order some products which we want to buy directly using the e-commerce sites , or we can send a letter using e-mail without going out for post office .personally i do nt like driving a car .i get stressed easily when i must park my car because of absence of free place or when there is a crazy traffic .in future i believe that there will be new type of transport such as the `` segway  which is small , easy and very comfortable .it needs just the electricity to make it work .so with introduce of these new transport invention i think we will need less the car .but i do nt think there will be much fewer cars than now , i immagine that just a bit fewer .because twenty years is enough to make a change as i wrote at the begining , but i must say at the same time it s not so long period .i will see after twenty years whether my opinion will be right .
