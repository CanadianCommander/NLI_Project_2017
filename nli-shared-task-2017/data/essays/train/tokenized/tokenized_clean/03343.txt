no one can deny that cars are so essential in the modern life .it is considered one of the main inventions of the twentieth century .we can find cars in almost every place we go to .the importance of the cars increases with the enormous increase in poplulation as a greater number of people are more likely to use cars .thus , one can not immagine that the number of the cars is going to decrease .this can not occur neither in the near future nor in the far future .and the reason is obvious , the increasing need to cars .what are those needs , one might ask ?i may tell him , do nt you need it in your own travel from place to place ?is nt it needed for the transportation of goods and trades ?it is also important for other purposes .for example , when we have a long vacation and we plan to travel to a distant place , will we go there walking ?is nt the car , our own car or even a puplic bus , important then ?i think we can not dispense with cars in all fields of our life .oh , how many uses there are for cars !!you can not count .but hey , we should stop at this point and ask , is nt this increasing need for cars going to make problems ?to be frank , many problems are expected .there will be more traffic problems .the noise rates will reach its maximum values .and the big lasting problem , the pollution .it is expected that the air would be polluted so much .but who knows , there might be some new invensions that help solve that problem .elctrically-driven cars might prevail .also , cars driven by solar energy may also be available on a large scale .in conclusion , the increasing need to cars supports the claim that the number of the cars is going to increase very much in the following years .but at the same time , finding good solutions to the different problems in cars nowadays is also needed .
