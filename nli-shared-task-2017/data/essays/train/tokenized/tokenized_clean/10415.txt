in my opinion the statement is true .actually everybody should have a wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects than to specialize in only one field .first , if you have a wider knowledge it will use yourself a lot because it supports you in the admission for the universities or in a future job .a lot of people will know after talking to others if somebody has a wider knowledge or not .and if you have an interview for a job or an admission interview at university , your knowledge can lead you to your goal a good job or admission .second if you have a good knowledge you can understand much more subjects and world problems than if you would not have it .and that will make your world more interesting .also can you assist by questions from your friends , parents or relatives and that gives you more self confidence and makes you more and more a respected partner .also will it develop your logical thinking and this point will lead to a greater knowledge again .futhermore , a good and wide knowledge will rest you a live time .and i think the more and more people learn and know about academic subject , there life becomes more interesting and they will also discover new interestings .like the museum , theatre , read the newspaper , books etc .this will make your world more colourful as if you only would live in your four walls , with your sole specialized subject .what if you will meet other people who do not know anything about your specific subject , which interesting discussion can you lead .to sum up , i prefer having a broad knowledge of many academic skills than just be specialized only in one specific academic subject .i think it is the better way to lead your life .because your knowledge can help you anywhere and in any situation .
