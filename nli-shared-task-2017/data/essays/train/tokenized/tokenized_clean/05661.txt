the problem that the statement underlines has an important impact on my personal life .as far as i m concerned , i really can not disagree with the statement because i am personally involved in this subject .i have been helping elderly people since i was 15 : it s not my job and i do nt get paid for it but when i have some spare time i just do it because i enjoy it .apart my personal experience , we have to face the fact that young people ( or most of them ) are completely not interested in helping their communities probably also because the means of comunication , such as tv radio internet , do nt stress too much on this problem .my suggestion is trying to make young people more conscious and responsive by organizing events that involve all the community .i live in a small village and i found this idea very useful .last summer i organized a big event that took all the people together just to meet each other , simply to know the neighbours and discover that there are a lot of people that need help .there is also another example that can express how much this problem is understimated .during the summer period most of the people go on holiday and leave their elderly relatives alone at home and they do nt take care of them at all and sometimes happens that they die and nobody knows ( just read a newspaper to find it out !! )that sounds disgusting !!!we can not be considered human beings if we behave in a way like this .
