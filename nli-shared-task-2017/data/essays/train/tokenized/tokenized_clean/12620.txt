who does nt have a car nowadays ?cars have become the easiest way of getting from one point to another , either to make short distances or to travel at the other side of a country .cars are one of the things ( with the cell phone ) that today s occidental population could nt live without .how will it be in the next few years ?will people suddenly stop using them ?we will try to give points that show that the number of cars on earth is going to be higher and higher , and that in twenty years , people will still use them as their favorite means of transport .we can start by saying that even if the gas prices did nt stop increasing those few last years and people coul nt stop complaining about it , it did nt prevent them from driving no matter what .a car is something everybody needs , and they wo nt stop using it even though their own wages had to be spent on gas .it s a little bit like smoking , even if the government keeps rising the prices of cigarettes , people would not stop smoking until public and private areas start prohibiting them to do so .people have become car addicted , and it will take a long time to change that .besides , driving has become a pretty cheap way to travel compared to the other means of transport such as trains or planes .for people who ca nt offer flying , cars appear to be a good way for them of being able to escape from their life , to take a break .cars are seen by many people such as teenagers as a key to reach freedom .you can go everywhere with a car as long as it s rolling .how can we prevent people from having their owm freedom even if it turns to be bad for the environment ?we ca nt , that s why cars will always be part of our lives , tyoday , tommorrow , or twenty years from now .
