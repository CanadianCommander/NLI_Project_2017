it has been well-established that successful people want to push their limits to the maximum and feel more and more sensations .i will develop and explain why i believed in this statement by using two main reasons illustrated by examples .the first reason is the money and the second one is the popularity .it is widespread that success goes with money .successful people evidently are one of the part of the society where there is the less problems with money .indeed , some of them ( without thinking ` most of them  ) become disgusted to have what they want , to do everything they want , to own , to buy , to offer , to live what they want to .that is the first reason why this people try new things and take risks .they own lots of things so they want always more and the only way for them to feel alive is to push their limits .it is to be out of bound , to show to everybody that they can easily do what they want , more than buy what they want .by knowing and understanding this way of thinking , it permits me to go on the second reason why they are acting as extremely as a professional skateboarder , surfer , snowboarder or others extreme sports .it is due to their popularity .besides being able to buy anything they want , they are proud of their ego and of the fact that unknown people loves them .even though they are successful , they are also conscious on the effects they have on others who do not succeed .and they use it to prove to everyone that they can be more than someone who succeed .so they try new things and take unconscious risks to confirm that anyway they are a part of people they definetely succeed .i would like to conclude that i understand them .i do not mean i feel successful but except money and popularity i love feeling me alive by looking for new sensations , taking risks ( always under laws and rules , of course ) and prove to myself that i can do ` extra-things  like no one else .
