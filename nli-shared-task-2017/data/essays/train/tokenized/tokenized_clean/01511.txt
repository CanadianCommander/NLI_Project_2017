generally speaking , advertisements make products attractive and desirable .let me start from scratch , what is the point of an advertisement ?it is of course to make sell .and why would someone buy an object if it seems useless and uneffective ?as a result , advertisment naturally tries to make a product look interesting .it is true that consequently , advertisements sometimes make a product seem much better than it really is .sometimes advertisements lie .yet it is not necessarily in its own interest to lie to consumers since they are not so stupid , and once a consumer finds out that he had been betrayed , he will not buy the product of the advertisement anymore .it might get even worst : the betrayed consumer may not buy any other products of this company .that is why , advertisements must be careful about what they are claiming , and they ought to win the consumer s trust by simply telling him what the true advantages of such or such product are .yet , it is also true that advertisements tends to emphasize the pros of an object and to hide its disadvantages .this is the implicit rule of business .unfortunatly , in occidental societies this rule is a general principle .one can not avoid it .so one must not be gullible .for these reasons , i am not shocked by advertisements even if they are false .one must simply be careful and read magazines about products that he wants to acquire .besides , i believe that advertisement is a everyday enjoyment .it is part of our lifes , and i do think that they are some advertisements that are very well done and that are very enjoyable , even if they lie a little .i prefer an intersesting but lying commercial than a realistic boring one .anywaym the main goal of advertisements is to ; ake a product known right ?and what is ; ore striking that a beautiful advertisement ?
