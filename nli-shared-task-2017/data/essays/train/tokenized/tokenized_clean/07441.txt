i agree the idea that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  , becasue i have three models of the successful people .first , one of the three successful people is my old brother .when he was a junior high schoo student , he did not like to study very well .he did not study , so his grade was not good .but one day , he met a high school teacher in the town .then he thought i want to be his student , so i want to take the his school entrance exam .but the school study revel is high .i should study hard .after my brother met the teacher , he studied very hard .so he could get better grade than before , and he could be one of a student of the teacher s high school .second , one of the three successful people is mr. toyota .he created the big and famous car company in japan .i think the company was one of the famous car companies in the world .when he was a child , his family was poor .becasue he must help to his family in his child age , he could not get studying oppotunity well .his father s job was small bike store , so when he graduate junior high school , he was president of the small company .then he created idea of corporation like big american trrain comopanies .the idea was very big risk then , becasue it was not common idea in japan .today , his company became a big company .third , one of the three successful people is syoinn yoshida .he was one of the most famous people in japan .he was teacher in meiji era .when he was teacher , he thought japan should learn from other contories like england or america .but then people , who go to abroad without permittion from government , was very big crime .but he tried to go to america .he swam to the america s big boart at the night .and he tried to go to america .but then american officer did not permit because america did not want to attack .but the story made japan courage .
