i agree with the idea that it is good for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are several reasons that i agree with the idea about this .first of all , the facts is just one of the result of the ideas and concepts .without ideas and concepts , it would not generate a good solution -- fact .second , understanding ideas and concepts will help to students to think critically and efficientlly .if students learn only the facts , they will not be able to analize why that fact is generated and where the fact is come from .third , fact can not be changed because it is just a fact .the answer is all the same , so if students learn only facts , they do not know what they should do when the trouble and problems are arise .if students understand ideas and concepts more than it is for them to learn facts , students will be able to think more critically and productively .if students just learn the fact , they will just the follow the rule and they can not find the other way to solve the problem .therefore , i agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
