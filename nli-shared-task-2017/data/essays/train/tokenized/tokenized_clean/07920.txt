i believe that people who are successful try a lot of new things even though they have high risks for the following reasons ; changeing time , improve themselves , and enjoying themselves .first of all , time must be changeing .our life style are changeing with time change .for example , people who lived in sexteen century did not use cars .their transportation was horse , caws , and so on .however , now , we can not live without cars , especially in the united states .a person , who made car at first , may be successful , and made us more convinience to live .one idea can change our life .second , when we are trying a new things , we can learn how to endure without conciousness .when we learn new things , we need a lot of knowledge , infortmation , and results of tests .it will take a long time .i respect to mendel , who identified the existance of dna in 19th century .he tried mating peas again and again .finally , trying new things make ourselves happy .in my opinion , people who do not have curiocity are like old-men .for example , i am very interested in science , especially biochemistry .when i study it , i am excited and i enjoy studying it .when i get good score on tests , i am very glad to study it hard .in addition , i can understand what happened i , environment , and earth thorough the science aknowledgements .in my childhood , i was not interested in science ; however , after i came the united states , i took chemistry class , my mind was opened .i felt that i could do anything i want to do .therefore , i can enjoy my life , now .in conclusion , i think people do not have to worry about risks of trying new things .trying new things will make them more optimistic and give a lot of confidence to them .
