in my opinion it is very important to combine both the situation and i do not think that one fact is more important then the other .every education program should involves theory and then support the theory with a large number of fact to confirm the previous .i would like to give an example on what i am trying to explain .in history we can find and evaluate how ideas and concepts can not be separeted from facts .the second world war was a result of the idea that the white race was superior to any other human beings in the world .the nazi idea of being superior was supported by intellectual people scientests , propaganda and mass media .as a matter of fact the germans were convinced that they nation was the strongest and powerful nation in the world .now the consequences of that period in history are well known around the globe , and the facts demonstrate that the idea was wrong and dangerous .so i think it is very important to correlate ideas and facts because it is not necessarily true that an idea that seem brilliant paceful and fair has always positive consequences when we try to put it in practice .i talked about the germans but i also could talk about the communist theory and its application in several countries .a doctrine that seems fair and just reveald not to be a good economic system .as a result millions of people died because of this idea .it is very important to understand the consequences of what an idea or a simple concept might lead to .it is also vital for students to estimate what exactly a concept is in the real world .an idea it is in fact something abstract .in my opinion it is always better to compare something re
