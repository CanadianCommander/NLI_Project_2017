the human knowledge can be formed by different topics , subjects , expiriences , memories and very important ; by many academic subjects .then , if we are able to broad knoledge of many academic subjects , why to specialize in one specific subject ? .on the one hand , when people often specialize only in one specific subject their basic knowledge is , obviously , going to be all about that specific subject .but , in the other hand thos who learn many subjects , and do not focus only in one , in my opinion are the ones who are closer to succes .i am going to support my opinion with two ordinary and essential examples .first , in our ordinary lifes we are expose to many different situations and expiriences , which we do not know if those are going to be easy or difficult to handle .for example , an ordinary conversation with your parter can be easy , but if you are talking to your boss you have to be prepared by having the necessary knowledge in a variety of different subjects .for this reason , we have to be prepared and to have all the necessary knowledge to be ready to defend any topic or subject that we are expose .by knowing all the information about only one subject will not help you to escape of a problem if it is based in another subject .second , the fact of wanting to be a good professional gives you chance to work in many different areas .for example , these are can be : bussiness , advertising , laws , and many more .so , if you are specialize only one subject gives you limites .in contrast , if you are well prepared with knowledge of different subjects you are able to establish a conversation in any topic .in conclusion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , than to specialize in one specific subjest .for the reason that it makes you a prepared person in every way .
