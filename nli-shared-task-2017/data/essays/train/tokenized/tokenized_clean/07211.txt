everyone in this world can enjoy his life in his own ways .people are different in expressing thier enjoying of life .how we can ejoy this life and be happy ?everyone knows that life is not easy and it needs lots of work to be successful person in it .there are two groups of people who can enjoy this life such as , the young people and the older pepole .first , yong peple can ejoy life in different ways .for example , they can do many things in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the resposibility are carried for thier parents .also , they can do a lot of things that the older people ca nt do as a result of health .young people can do a lot of activities on one day , but the older peolpe ca nt do that .so the young people are the right people to enjoy this life .secound , older poeple can , t enjoy this life like the young people .there are different reasons for that .the firt reason , is that the are responsible for eveything they do .also , the reason of health ca nt help them to do a lot of activities on one day .the logic provides these points in a very clear way .old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young .so they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy his own life .finally , in my opinion , i agree that young people are the right peolpe to enjoy tis life .that is because the older people had already taken thier own chance .also , i disagree that the older peolple must relax after they have finished thier work in the whole life because they are the people who must have other works .such as , teaching thier children the right tings to do and to have the resposibiltiy of what thier young children do .in conclusion , this life is for all the peolpe to enjoy , but the right people or the people who have the chance to enjoy it more are the young people .we must all enjoy this life in the duration of time when we are young .
