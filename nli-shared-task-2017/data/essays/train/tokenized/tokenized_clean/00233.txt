the advantages and disadvantages of group travelling led by a guide are many .travel in a group is organized visa vis of time to spend on each site and the number of sites to see .the travel in group is more secure , people travelling together may assist each other when needed .however , an other positive factor when travelling in group , is that all the arrangements are made in advance and each individual member of the group has not to worry about hotel booking , food and other arrangements necessary for the trip .the disadvantages of travelling in a group is the limited freedom each member of the group has .means that anyone has to stick to the etablished schedule and nobody can make changes to it .nobody can make a decision on behalf of the group .however , travelling in a group may deprive you of seeing sites you want to go to , visit friends or spent more time in one of your preferred site .in the other hand , the group travel is financially worth , because sometimes paying for a group of people is entittled to a discount .i do also agree that the best travel is in a group , when it concerns time spent to search for touristics sites , the tour guide is easy and will economize you a lot of time to find these sites .certainly , as mentioned above , a guide may economize your time and also provide you with information that sometimes are difficult to get for an individual traveller .in conclusion , people are free to choose between travelling alone and travelling in a group led by a tour guide .the human being s nature dictates over any personel decision .therefore , my agreement with the statement about travel in a group is the best , should not influence the opinion of people who want to join me in the trip .
