while during primary and secondary school time it is essential to gain a broad knowledge about many different scientific subjects , i think after aquiring this basic knowledge on various subjects it is equally vital to concentrate further on one specific subject for your further career .i therefore generally disagree with the statement and will explain my opinion in the following .we live in a world that reflects high levels of specialization in every work branch you look upon .even a computer expert today for example can be classified in various ways , according to the branch he works in .he could be a software designer or a hardware engineer for example .so even within an already very specialized branch , there are still more subdivisions .to keep up with those general movement of specialization in the working world , you just have to adapt and specialize on one subject or you will get left behind .another example related to this i can draw from my own experience - out of my own development within my academical career .i started studying forest sciences , then after four semesters i concentrated on zoology , and after another two semesters i focused further on entomology .i think this was a natural development and most students make this kind of progress .on the contrary , if you do not specialize in any kind of area within your studies , it might appear as if you are not interested enough in any subject .it then seems as if you are not going through any positive personal development .in my opinion therefore , someone who fails to specialize himself during his studies has missed an important chance already to shape his future and career .concluding , out of the reason expressed above , i disagree with the statement .altough i have to admit that in early education a bias should lie on building up a broad knowledge on various subjects , in the major part of the rest of one s life it is more important to specialize on one specific area of interest and to increase knowledge on that subject .this importance of specialization is heavily determined through the fast and innovative time we live in , which explores its subjects in ever greater detail and is in need of experts for that .
