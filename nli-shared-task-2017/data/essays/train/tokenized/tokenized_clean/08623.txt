the issue at hand is wheter young people work enough for their communities .this issue is important because working for the community helps to develop social skills .i believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .first , young people nowadays are more interested in having fun than in helping their communities .for example , young people like doing a lot of sports or going out with friends .beside these activities , there is no more time for community work .second , young people have to work hard in their jobs .the competition has become harder and harder .to keep your job , you have to be focused on it completely .community work would keep you away from your work .many of the young people avoid this kind of activity for this reason .thrid , many of the young people are a little bit selfish nowadays .john f. kennedy said once : `` you do nt have to ask what your nation can do for you , you have to ask what you can do for your nation !unfortunately , a lot of young people are more interested what they can get from the society rather than contribute themselves to the positive development of their community .a good example for the changing attidtude towards community work is the swiss army : by law , every swiss man has to join the army .but , in fact , more than 40 % of the young men are released from military service .many of them just do not want do military service because it is inconvenient .finally , the image of the community work has changed in the last few years .whereas in earlier times people working for the communities were regarded as very respectful members of the society , a lot of people are laughing at them nowadays .today it is much more important to have a lot of money and to be very succesful in the job .to sum up , i believe that the young people nowadays do not help enough their communities .there are different reasons for that , as i mentioned , but i do not think this development
