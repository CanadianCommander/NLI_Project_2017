the problem of the new trade is directly connected to the fact that we must understand which products have really true effect , and which not .today a lot of people go to supermarkets to buy their products , because in these places they can have a lot of chosen .at the same time we must take attention to what we buy , because a lot of products seem much better than they really are .generally we buy an economic product because we think that it must have the same effect than one expensive , but i think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than another , and this reason is not only connected to the fact that one bring an important name , and another not .generally when we buy a product that have a maior cost , meaning that we have buy a sicure object , that we ll can use without any problem , also if we must remember that this is nt always treu , because we always find some surprises .at the contrary when we buy a product cheapper than another , we can find bed surprises .for these reasons i buy always products that are nt so cheapper , but also not expansive ; however it depents to what i must buy .when i buy a dress i want somethingh that give me a garancy of quality , and generally it s directly connected to the cost of the object ; the same thingh happen when i must buy the meal , or somethingh for my house . ..so i prefer spend somethingh more when i buy a product that must during , and i spend less when i buy somethingh that does nt have much importance , for exemple somethingh that i m not sure that i will use a lot .in conclusion i m agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and for this reason i try to do attention to what i but , trying to buy somethingh that has a middle cost among the products that i can find .at the same time i want remenber that it s not always true that an expensive product is better then one that is cheap .
