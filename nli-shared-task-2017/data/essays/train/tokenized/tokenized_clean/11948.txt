young people are more energetic and they might therefore appear to enjoy life more than older people .however , in my opinion , happiness and enjoyment are closely related to a human being s state of mind , no matter what the biological age of that person is .therefore , i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .one can reason that young people have lesser responsibilities and therefore more reason to enjoy life .again , this might not always be the case .i would like to give the example my friend who was financially supporting his family when we were still in school .he had taken on responsibilites early in life , however , that did not keep him from enjoying it .he seemed to be the happiest person in my class .i think his happness had to do with how satisfied he was with life .on the other hand some older people do not loose their sense of adventure .they keep their bodies fit through exercise and use their strength to travel and enjoy the vacations they could not afford when they were younger , due to time or money constraints .some older people enjoy hobbies they otherwise never had time for .i know of a gentleman who started writing poetry after he retired from work .his poems were greatly appreciated and he soon published a book .at the same time there are young people who get disillusoned and resort to self destructive or illeagle acts in the pursuit of enjoyment .in conclusion , it does not matter what the age of the person is .if a person has a healthy state of mind , he / she will always manage to enjoy , no matter what his / her age .
