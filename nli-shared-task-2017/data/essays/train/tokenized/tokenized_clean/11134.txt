considering the academic period of the education there can be say alot of plots , ideas and many other impressions on specialize in one specific subject or is it better to have a variety of many academic subjects .on answering that question , primarilly we have to deal with two major points in education which indicates us the position of our life and future outcomings .the first is our life condition .the latter one is about to the plans and feed backs .if a person in academics wondered to make an extend to vary his knowledge , mostly he or she would have no any economical problems or any anxiety on his working conditions .to explain that , they have already satisfied with their life style and they wonder to know much more knowledge .besides their motivation on learning varities have almost acts them to doing that relentlessly .for me to become one pointed or one focused trainning programe makes person much aware of life and in worklife .in work a life for instance , person must be well qualified on his or her matter .while dealing with the trouble in work sector , person must be elite on his or her section for being a qualified one .thats why , focusuing on one section would be more essential and vital for the person in a specific range .it is also crucial for me that a person must aware of his life standarts .chosing one section field may not help utterly to person .being aware of field and determined what to do are also other necessities .a great deal of time have to be spended on one section field .you have to asses your knowledge oftenly or you may fail in advancing information .holding both advantages and disadvantages focusing on one field is my indespensable selection .
