this has always been a controversial and complex question .as we do not hve a clear boarderline for the words  young  and `` old  , it is complicated to judge this matter .in my oppinion , i think it depends .different people have different point of views of life .that is the most curcial reason why i think it depends .we can not simplily decide which enjoys better .to illustrate , when i was little , i used to live near the coast , my grandmother often take me to the beach and tell me about her life and things she felt happy about .i can feel the love and pure joy .we had a great time .i can tell from my feelings and her smiles that we are all enjoying our life at that moment .we can feel the joy and happiness from the bottom of our hearts .i do not think i can tell the difference between our joyfull giggles .thus , i can not tell who enjoys life more .we face various situations everyday .how we feel about these eveyday problems effects our feelings towards life .as some of the old peoples have come across many hardtimes their whole life , they seem to look blue everyday .some complains about the community frequently , the others often sit together and gossip about other people s business .they never look satisfied and always feel dull .to me , i do not think they enjoy their life .they do not seem to understand the meaning of life -- to be confident and always believe that tomorrow is another day .when ever i see a little joyful kid passing by a old lady with unsatisfiction in her eyes , i constantly believe that in some case , youth enjoy life more than eld .on the contray .nowdays thousands and thousands of youth are addicted to the internet , durgs , and all kinds of harmful things like that .they think they are estactic when they are doing the wrong things .are they enjoying life as they think they are ?i believe the answer is i strongely oppose .comparing with the laughs we heard when an old couple celebrating their 60 anniversary , i think some young people should something from them .thus , i think it depends .
