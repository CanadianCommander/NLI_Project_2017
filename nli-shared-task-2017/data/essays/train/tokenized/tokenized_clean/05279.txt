i am agree wih the statemant .i have three reasons why i m support the statement .first , it is natural making products seem much better than they really are .advertisement is economy .so , making products seem much better is nurtural .please imagine .for example , food .if the advertisement in food do nt look like delicious , most people will not buy because it seems taste bad .then , economy does nt work .nobady buy it , then , the products disappear .the reasn why most people buy the product is influenced in advertisement .at least , japan , most people are influenced by advertisement .in fact , i m one of them .second , advertisement is competition between many companies .how they can make the people to buy it or how make their products look like good .it is true that the product which i bought was bad .however , it shows that how the advertisement have big influence .finally , you know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .you shoud remember thet .i think making prducts seem much better is bad thing .but , above all , it is economy .so , we ca nt do anything .all we have to do is remember that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
