i do not agree with the statement .we need advertisement in our life .we are live in the modern era , through advertisements , we can know what the world is going on .and the manufactory also need through the advertisements let the poeple know their products .first , manufacture need let the people know their product , and the advertisements are the best way to present their product .for example , i wanted to buy a new car last year , but there were so many kinds of cars in the market .how could i choose a good one ?i just opened the newspaper to look for the classification .i found the nissan is the best one to meet my need that included safety and also can save a lot of gas which compared to other brand car .so i chose nissan , and i drive it for a year it really good .through advertisement i save time , and also save money .the other reason we need the ad .is because people need to know where to find the product they need .i always look for adervtisement to find where to find the latest product .such as the lancome product , i like this name product very much , and they always have new product come .so through the ad .i can get the latest product to use .it is true , there are some of the producer misuse the advertisement to cheat people .but that is not from long term running , people will know it after they use it .so that is mean this kind of performance will not last longer .from all above , the manufacture need to find a best way to show their products , and people can use the advertisements to find the thing they need .advertisementcan save time , and get good result .
