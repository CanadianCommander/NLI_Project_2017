every body knows jetsons the cartoon where you dont find any cars people travel in jets but then that may not an hypothetical situation in the near future .in twenty years there can be a lot of development that can even be dared to think of .now if you look back at the start of the century we you have the feeling that we sailed a lot .i take the stand that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years than now , the replacememt of the cars can take the following course .first , as there is huge surge in number of cars in all the country s they tend to expand there infrastructure but after reaching the saturation point you just do nt have any land left out to fulfill your residential and infrastrucute needs .besides , the pollution caused due to the emmision from cars needs to be cut down as we have the impending threat of ozone layer depletion .thus , we arrive at situation where cars are neccessary evils .then to nullify the pollution effect we go for cars that are hybrid , eco-friendly , electrically charged , water operated .but we still have the infrastructure problem , so to have effective commutation in busy traffic regions people will go for bikes or bicycles we see that today in china , we also see hybrid models of cars being launched .we also have a situation where mass commutation is becoming popular day by day and is proving to be more effective than having a own car .second step is when even with the hybrid cars doe nt serve your purpose they do nt help you in getting any faster to your place .so , you naturally tend to look at the other options we have lots of air space .there is a research going on how to effectively use ion combination for transportation this process is less harmful to the environment and is effective to have air borne vehicles .this slowly but surely replaces the cars in the next 20 or odd years .where naturally first the upper class people gets hold of it then it reaches the common man later .if i m not over exaggerating recently denmark scientists have a break thtough in teletransportation of material for a few meters there might be a day we can use the fruits of this when even the air traffic is also difficult to handle but it s certainly not in the near future as it is in budding state .thus , i conclude that cars will be lesser than there are today because of the above mentioned reasons .
