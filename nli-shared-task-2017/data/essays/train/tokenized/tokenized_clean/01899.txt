it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than knowing facts .people should not only keep articles or dates from a textbook in their mind .dates where great wars where held or milestone where set are easily available in todays world wich is full with informations .for example , only the knowing of the outbreak of the second world war , 1 september 1939 is an information anyone can get from any history book .but the reasons for the start of the war , the circumstances how the nationalist came to govern the country and the reality that the reasons for the second war are the obligations from the winning countries to the defeated countriesat at the end of the first world war requires students to understand the reasons , relations and connections of the main ideas of any topic .another example is the manufactoring of car .a student may find out easily the number of cars producted during a decade or the increase in the car production during the last 50 years , but the new live style wich has the mass production of cars brought with it , the effects on the society and the possibility to travel need more than learning statistics .there can be many examples given .nowadays a student a can get many facts from libaries or the internet .so therefore i can say that not knowing facts , but understanding ideas , concepts , the relations between cause and effect are more important to learn .
