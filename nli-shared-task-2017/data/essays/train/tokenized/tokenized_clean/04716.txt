live is made of facts .those facts probbably came from good concepts and ideas that helped you to make those facts .it  very important to students to understand ideas and concepts , this will give them a good base for their lives .are our roots since the human started to think .for example , is like when you go to college or university , first , you have to learn how mathematics works , design , engineering and other classes in order to learn how to make a car .if you just listen to your teacher about how they built a car or how companies built their cars , you will have an small idea how that works , but it wont be as helpfull as understanding ideas will be .a basic example might be : you do nt write an article unless you now how to write .when you learn from facts you are learning from an external source and experience , and each person is different , moment are different , you do nt know what is behind that fact .it could be totally unlikelly from what you have learned .for example , cars again , europeans started building cars for their own geography and characteristics , they were totally different from the ones built in asia , because they are in differents places .there is a process in life , humans learn ideas and concepts , we can not say that we do nt learn from facts , but whe need someone to teach us how the thinks works , which tools should we use , methods , organization , etc .after that , we will start to see different facts , but with some information in our brains .thas is what makes the difference .it is much eassier for a student understand ideas and concepts that learn from facts .that is why we belive in education , that is why education is so important in this world , and continues growing every day .education is based on ideas and concepts , not on facts
