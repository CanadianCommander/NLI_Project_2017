nowadays it may seem at first sight , watching the daily news about the terrible , careless and lazy youth , that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .in my opinion this statement does not show how reality really looks like .of course there are young people who do nt do anything for their community , but there are still a lot of young , intelligent and involved people who show their best leadership and invest hard work into supporting and helping their communities on a volunteer bases .the cause of the statement shown above might be the always existing and never ending generation conflict that reflames in every country and in every century .but young people do help their communities these days too .for example at my university there are a lot of possibilities for students to get involved in community service as a volunteer .of course not every students gets involved with community work but most of my friends do .let me give some certain examples : there is a law club that gives legal adive to people who can not afford a lawyer .the people who come there do not have enough money to pay a normal lawyer , so the students organised a club where they help people to find legal advice , but do not take any money for it .( this happens in poland , in germany it is forbidden ) .another students club takes care for the environment , another teaches little children to speak foreign languages , and another helps unemployed people to organise a company or firm and take the first legal and economic steps to it by developing business plans .a lot of students get involved in their ` international  community as well , joining amnesty international for instance and fighting for human rights through organising different actions like writing letters to different governments , governements who are violating human rights .some of my friends get involved socially .they go to schools and do a social year in their own country or in foreign countries for example .ina , a friend of mine , did that in a middle school for handicaped children in cologne .she was helping out there as a volunteer , and did not get any benefits from it ( except her personal experience of course ) .another example is that young men help out as a ` zivi  between their graduation from high school and studies at a university or other jobtraining , to avoid going to the army for one year .the most common is for them to help out in hospitals or homes for older people .and they do nt just do it to avoid the army .some of them , as my friend for example , stay longer at the institution .there are far more examples of how students and other young people get involved in helping their community .they do care , no matter what adults or older people might say and how bad the generation conflict might get .it proves that the young people nowadays are not as careless as one might think .
