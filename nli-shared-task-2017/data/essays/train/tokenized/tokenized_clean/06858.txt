i disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today in twenty years , because , basically , i think it stays the same as many people like to have their private cars .indeed , it is good to have public transportation means such as , trains and buses , as they reduces not only the traffic jam but also the pollutions .and i believe , for such reason , there will be more high-advanced public transportation means in the future and i can easily assume that many people may think that it may reduces the number of cars on the roads .however , at the same time , i believe that , even under such circumstances , many people still prefer to have their own private cars .there are many people whose residents are not close to the stop-point of the public transportaion , especially in rural areas .for instance , my uncle is living in a rural area of japan where it takes fifty minutes to get to the closest train station .and , there are many people who like driving itself .also , there are many people who really prefer to have private space even at the the time of commute .for example , i have a friend who really likes to take cars .i usually prefer to go for trip by trains because , in that way , i do not need to care how to get to the destination and where to go to the bathrooms .however , this friend living in urban areas in tokyo , always go for trip by car even if it takes longer time than going by trains .he once told me that he prefer cars to trains and buses because it gives him more private time and he does not want anybody to bother while commuting .i believe this is true to many other persons .many people think it is important to have private time .i think it is true that , if you are busy communicating people , then you feel frustrated and in that situation , people need private time .given all those circumstances , i still believe that , so long as people are as busy as now , even twenty years after , the there will be same number or even more cars as it is now .
