i totally agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than how they actually are .there are mainly three reasons why i support this idea .first of all , i want to underline what i call `` the value of experience  .i think everybody has a bad memory of a product he/she bought .moreover , i think everybody could tell a story about how his/her expectations were not met by the purchase of goods and services advertised in the media world .i think personal experiences can say a lot about how tricky advertisements can be .as an example , i remember the first time i bought a new type of frozen pizza that was adveritized for a while all around italy .the images seen on tv showed a fine and elaborate pizza served with some fresh napolitan ingredients .in reality , the pizza turned out to be a poor imitation of the original one that i was shown in the advertisement .second , i think that the types of advertisement on tv , newspapers and even on the web can never be completely reliable .what i mean is that a product or service can not be perfectly reproduced on paper or through a photo .this second point is pretty technical , but i believe it is important .finally , it appears clear to me that advertizing techniques are well known and designed for being tricky .even in a well-functioning market economy , you can not impose rules that prevent companies from describing or presenting a product in a way that increases its value .obviously , there are some limits that companies and advertising agencies must follow to be in line with the regulations and law enforcement , but in general i think there is enough room to induce a consumer to buy goods which are not how they are in reality .in conclusion , i think it is inevitable to come across products , buy them and then regret to have done so because the products were not exactly what we thought .
