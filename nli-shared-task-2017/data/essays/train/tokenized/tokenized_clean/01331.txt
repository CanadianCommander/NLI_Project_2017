i think travel with friend and without tour guide is the best .true happiness and knowledge came from horrable experience .if tour guide are together with you , there are any ploblems .how and you get the worth of effort on that conditions ?travel with friend means it s better than the alone .of course there are many benefits in travel alone , but the pleasure is less than the two .i think to have pleasure and happiness also important in traveling .2 years ago , i went to philipines with only my best friend for almost one year .that gives me strong self-confidence , relationships , and lots of experiences .through the terrible mistakes , i had many bad suffer .but that gaves me amazing social abilities .of course , travel with tour guide can give us specific information .but it is less important than the lots of benfits which is get by oneself .and that is more useful to live in .in korea , many people travel alone or with friend before the graduate from university .so called bagpack-travel .in my opinion , the best way to travel is with your best friend .
