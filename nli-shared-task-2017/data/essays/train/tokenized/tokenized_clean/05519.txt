young people enjoy life more than older people do .this a commonly held view , but not necessarily a correct one .throughout the years , there has been an immense gap created between the young and the old ; emphasized by literature and the media .however it has not been an accurate representation of life itself .even though it is true that younger individuals do hold substantial differences when compared to older ones , different is not a synonym of better or worse .that is why youngsters do not enjoy life more than older people do , as they simply hold different interests , values , and priorities .one of the factors that diferentiates the different generations the most is interests .younger people tend to be more interested in the new trends , and even follow the current styles in regards to fashion , music , and entertainment .older individuals on the other hand , tend to hold on the past , and to be more interested in trends of their younger years .this difference , however , does not mean that younger individuals can enjoy life to a greater extent , it simply means that some areas , such as personal interests tend to vary with the pass of time .another factor that marks a difference between younger and older people , are values .younger people seem to live in the moment , and sometimes even avoid the future .their values have a tendency to be similar to those of the people of thier generation ; things such as friends , or an education .however , older people seem to plan ahead much more , and tend to hold the values and morals of thier earlier years .values start to modify with th pass of time , and start to modernize .that is why older people hold more conservative values in comparison to the younger generations .however , enjoying life has nothing to do with morals , but rather on an individual s personal level , and that is why it does not mean that older people are lacking a love for life .finally , th last factor that differentiates the younger from the older are priorities .older people have many more responsabilities , since they have to take care of entire families , and even provide a stable income .younger people on the other hand have other priorities , such as completing a proper education , and planning ahead for their future .it is clear that both parties have apparent differences , mainly because of the coming of age , however it does not mean that younger people enjoy life to a greater extent .every individual is different , and they each have thier ways of viewing life .most older people tend to have similar outlooks , as younger people do as well .however , this does not mean that one knows how to enjoy life better than the other , or that one has the right recipe to happiness .they are merely apparent differences that highlight the diversity that the world possessess .because enjoying life varies from person to person , and what might be the correct manner in which to seize life for one individual , might not necessarily work for the next .
