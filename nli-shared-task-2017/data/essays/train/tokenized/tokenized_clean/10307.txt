first of all i would like to define what a car might be in 20 years .for me it is possible that cars can fly in twenty years .thus , the traffic will extend from the ground into the air .the world s population is increasing every year , which means that there will be more customers , who will need a car .china , for example , is becoming economicly more and more successfull .there will be an increase in the employment rate , which leads to a higher qualified personal and an increase in the individuals income .basicly , people can afford more , and one of the first thing someone buys when he can afford it , is a car .at hte same time more poeple means more logistics to sustain the basic necissities of life .there will be an increse in public transportation as well .if there will be rescrictions on the total number of vehicles on the planet because of pollution , i simply say that fossil resources will be exhausted in twenty years , anyway , and that engines will run on electricity from sunlight or other clean energy sources .cars are the cheapest choice for transporting , next to trains of course , but they are much more mobile than trains and therefore more frequently used to transport goods .i guess that the car producing industry will although have a word in that matter , because it is an ever newe inventative section of industry , which provides may working places all over the planet .the car industry can count on governmental aid should it ever come to a point when no more cars are neede , which will never .ever !therefore i totally diagree with the statement , that there will be less cars on the road than there are today .human society and the world wide trade would crush down without a agil and cheap transportation systam as cars .
