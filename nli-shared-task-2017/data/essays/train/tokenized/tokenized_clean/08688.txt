in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .when were cars invinted ?how many cars were produced since that date ?what s the annual growth of cars  production ?this was all i needed to think about to decide if i agree or disagree with the provided statement .i of course disagree with the statement .why do i disagree with the statement ?it s because of my questions that i asked myself earlier when trying to decide if i agree with the statement or not .not only because of these questions that i disagree with the statement .let s just take a look at the vehicle industry , how many manufactoring companies were in the market just 50 years ago in comparison to the number of companies these days ?i used to be able to know what was the brand of a car by just looking at the design , and they were nt that many .now each company has more than 10 models of cars and i ll not claim that i know all brands out there but here while i m writing this essay i can remember 37 brands .this would nt be the case if number of cars are expected to drop any time soon , except maybe if we invinted flying cars .even if i do nt bring up statistics and work with only perception ; i ve been driving for over 7 years now and i can honestly say that each year it gets worst .traffic is becoming a nightmare , number of bridges and underground stations are trippling each year not even doubling .i live in cairo , and i believe there will come a time when we will not find a place on ground to have another underground station and i ca nt even imagine where are they going to find space to build more bridges .maybe if public transportations were more organized , or if we increase the age group that can be permitted to drive ; say 21 years of age .i do nt realy know what can be done to decrease the invasion of cars .what i do know is that cars usage is increasing and it s not decreasing anytime soon .
