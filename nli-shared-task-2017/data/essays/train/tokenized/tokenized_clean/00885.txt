i totally agree with the statement of `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .why i agree with this point of view , and how do i feel about it ?i think there would be some good reasons for getting young people nowadays can be more invoed with their communities .first of all , i think why the young people nowadays do nt like spending time with their communities , because in the morden day as we are now , there are lots of interesting things and places that young people prefered to take .such as video games , internet , travelling , and meeting new friends these are the reasons that take lots of time from the young people nowadays than the young people at the past-time .another main point i think will be the industry revolution .in the past time they need a lot of body work that mean everyone have to get involed their communities to help each other .but at nowadays , we are living in an very different forms of life than the early days .that everyone just have to take care of their own life and no need to rely on the others .how is it effect to our nowadays communities by the young people do not give enough time to helping ?i think it affects in many ways of our socity .one the main effects , i think , is the relationship between people live in communities .as the result of this problem the relationship get colder and colder between each others .so i think if we can encourage the young people to helping their communities in many different ways that will bring people close of their communities .people will start knowing each other and helping each other , and it can also help the young people to do more valueable things than just waste their time on the other things .
