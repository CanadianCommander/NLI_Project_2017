taking risks and trying new things is an important ability in many jobs nowadays .if people had not taken a certain risk , many business ideas would never have come on the market for example .thus a risk often bears an opportunity .on the other hand , new businesses might also fail and leave their owners highly indebted , which means a sudden crash into poverty that often has effects on a person s self-esteem .in that way risks bear both opportunities and the possibility to destroy everything that has already been achieved .the question is , however , if people who do not take any risks are in total more , less or equally successful as those who do .i guess that the only jobs where fleeing responsibility and not taking certain risks does not limit career options is as a state employee , for example as a teacher in germany .when people can not be fired , they actually do not have much of a risk in their job .still , i have made the experience that teachers who try something new are often preferred by students .so trying somthing new is a good thing even in their job .i consider it to be very important to try new things anyway , and as in the example of the teacher , not everything new bears a risk .in any other case , i suppose it is important to make a decision by comparing the size of the risk and the benefits it might have .a high risk for a little success is in my opinion not worth striving for .if it is the other way round , however : why not ?because concluding i think : those who do take risks and try new things really are more successful .
