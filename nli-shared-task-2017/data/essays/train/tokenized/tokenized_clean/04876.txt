ideas and facts are two sides of the same coin .while ideas bring about new experimentation , new technologies , new behaviourr , new ways to do things ; thier success brings about facts .i personally beleive it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts as well as learn facts .facts usually gives the basis of an idea .they know that this is what the charatersitcs are ; they can formulate an idea with the existing fact .focusing on only one facotr , i.e an idea or fact would mean invitng more errors or having things done the monotnous way .for example : new techonology have been invented in the recent past becuase of new ideas being generated ; however , the existing facts about the present technology has helped them develop news ones .knowledge of facts helps students realise the limitations and the strength of a certain subject .concepts on the other hand are the basis of understanding any subject .if a student has not understood his concepts well , he would be unable to understand the fatcs and not bult up on ideas .concept is the backbone of both ideras and facts .for example if a student ubderstands newtons law of gravity , he would understand that every thing around is attracted by earth .once he understand the concept , he can understand the facts about gravity and then built on new dieas to built a parchute or an aircraft .ideas , concept6s and facts belong to a viscious circle where one thing is realted to the other and can not survive without the other .now , if students are exposed only to concepts and told to built on ideas then they might be building the same things which is already exisiting , or they might repeat the same mistakes made by thier forefathers .similarly , if students are only basing thier knowledge on facts they might not be in a position to invent new things and stick to the same old way of life .hence looking at all these matters , i conclude that ideas , facts and concepts are equally imporant to students .
