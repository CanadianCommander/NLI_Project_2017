i personally agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects would be a good idea .students will be familiarized about broad knowledge of many academic subjects to increase his chances of getting a job after graduation or maybe during his studies .also , it might enable him after graduation to handle different tasks , which will eventually help him to be promoted faster and get higher performance evaluation .moreover , knowing many academic subjects will help all of us to create our own business upon graduation .i graduated from the king fahd university in saudi arabia back in year 2000 with a bs degree in the electrical field .i took a broad knowledge of many academic subjects including power , control , communication , and from other fields .it took me only one week to join saudi aramco company , which is considered one of the largest oil producers in the world .when i joined the comany , my management evaluated my qualifications .they discovered that i have braod knowledge of many technical subjects .my management nominated me to work in several investigation committess since i knew many technical subjects .also , i have been assigned to perform my technical studies in the power , control and communciations fields .recenly , i have been nominated to work in one of the largest projects that saudi aramco will construct , which is manafia project .this project is considerd a mega-project and it will start in year 2007 .this assignment is one of the challenge assessments that i might face .however , it is considered a golden chance .i presenting my story to demonstarate how broad knowledge of technical subject might create golden chances for us .therefore , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be specalized in one specific field .
