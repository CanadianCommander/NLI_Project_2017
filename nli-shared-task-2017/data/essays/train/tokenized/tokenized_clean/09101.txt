there is no doubt in saying that successful people try new things and take risks .i agree with this statement cent percent .in my view success comes when we try out something new .doing the things what we already know does not pave way to success .for example , scientists try out new things in order to invent or discover things .for instance , take the example of mr. thomas alva edison who is a successful scientist .he took many risks and tried new things thereby inventing a lot of things we use today .likewise madam curie who took great risk in discovering radium was a very successful scientist in this world .the reason for taking risks , in my view , is to reach out for new things and innovation there by getting success .by doing the same things does not give us a chance to grow .another field which we can imply this statement is the field of business .the basic rule of the business as far as i know is the ability to take risks at required times .without taking risks the business will not develop .the entire commercial field and advertising field rely mostly upon the new things and risks .the successful business persons in the past and present support this statement because they must have taken risk at some point of time .in the field of information technology also innovation is very important and it is the basis of that field because it is a ever changing field .we can add the space technology , biology , genetics and lot more fields in this list .whatever field and whatever conditions may be one has to take risks and try out new things in order to get success .
