in my country , the parents usually say to their children that you do nt have to do new things for success , risking your life , but just do what you have done well so far .for me , however , successful people seem more creative and adventurous rather than conservative and tending to be safe .the world is relentlessly changing .without any changes of one s self , one can not come up with the change of the world , even if one already has become successful .consequently , one will keep staying the past , and not be able to make an achievement meaningful for the present .in addition , if people only keep doing what they know how to do well , someone else will try to do what other people know how to do well , and he or she finally will become another master of it .after all , there will be no difference among them , and therefore be no new succeed for previous successful people .accordingly , in order that not only normal people become successful people but also already successful people keep up with their past succeed , they should make a new try .needless to say , already successful people have done like that , will do so for their future succeed .but , i do nt mean that the what people has done before is not important so far .it can be great basis for new things .so , it is also essential to respect what we have already done .
