my neighbour family had a car for all the family .when i was visiting them last time i saw three cars in thier garage !i really surprised and i think after twenty years they will 8 cars .i belive that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .i think that because of two main reasons : economic and population .first , i think that we will have more cars for economic reason because the world is becoming a idustrial world and all of people have a higher salary than before so they will spend more money in buying cars .as many rich stars do if they have mony , simpley they buy new cars .it is kind of luxsuries .many people belive that if u have money , you have to buy a car .because of the money that people will have and becoming bussniss people they must have a modern and more cars than the people had .also , the cars factories will try to satistfy the consumers and they will produce more cars than any time .second , because of increasing in population , many people will need cars to do thier daily jobs and thier works .as a result of this increasing , people try to satistfy themselves and thier family so they will buy more and more cars .i noticed that my uncle family have five cars because their family is growing and if we imagine what will happen after twenty years , we can clearly relase that there will be more cars in the future .if many people are trying to have a higher level for salary and the population number will growing i think we will have more cars than the number of people and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age  .
