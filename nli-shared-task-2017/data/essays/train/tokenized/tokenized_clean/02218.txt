i do nt agree that there will be less cars in use in twenty years comparing to today .the history of car production and of ownership of a car shows that the amount of cars is rising and rising .ok you can say : `` but the bad enviromental situation will lead to less cars and more to alternativs like public buses and subways !but in my opinion this is not the way people will think .the most highest values for most of the modern people living today are mobility and flexibilty .you can go where ever you want , when ever you want !further than that : you have to be flexible .it s important for your job and to catch up with the speed the world is running .for example : i m working as a cinematographer since several years for different broadcast stations .the medium of television became so fast during the last 15 to 20 years because there were such important inventions like mobile phones and the internet .you can react on certain news much more faster than some years ago .when the medium is becoming faster the people who are feeding the medium have to become faster .following this line it is important to be flexible .one way to be flexible is to have a car .so at the end the circle is closed .on the other hand it is a must for the people to think about alternatives next to the using of cars .the raising of the amount of cars on the street will lead to a traffic-collaps .in this case the gouvernment is also in charge to support alternative ways of transportation .this can be in spending money on traffic research projects or in supporting scientists who are developing new ways of energy supplies for cars .at the end it will lead to more cars but with alternative ways of running them .fuel - and diesel-driven cars should be reduced and instead of this solar , hybrid - or hydrogenic-based vehicles should be supported .
