i think that we all need to have a minimum knowledge of many academic subjects but we have to specialize in one specific subject .during the childhood , we all studied mathematics but also skills on language or history .and we all agree that it is essential for everybody to know some things on many academic subjects , because it is usefull all day long .you use mathematics when you are going out shopping , you have to know a bite of history if you want to understand what is happening on the political news , and you must know how to read in today world .but if you want to succeed in your work , you have to be the best or at least one of the best in the subject that you are dealing with .because today s world is done of concurrence and nobody will help you if you do not succeed .so you have to train a lot and become the best in what you want to deal with in your life .look at a sportif .is tiger woods practicing other sports than golf ?maybe sometimes but he is really focused on golf and he is really specialized on his subject .if he had done during his childhood many differents sports he may not be the world number one at golf today .but culture is also essential and culture is about everything .the definition in french of a ` gentilhomme  is somebody who knows many things on many subjects and who does not have a passion .if someone can speaks on many different subjects it will be someone looked like an intelligent guy .thus if you want to succeed in your social life you must have broad knoledge of many academic subjects but if you want to succeed in your work and earn a lot of money you then must to specialize in one specific subject and become the best on that subject
