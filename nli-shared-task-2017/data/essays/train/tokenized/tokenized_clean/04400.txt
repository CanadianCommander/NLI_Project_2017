frankly speaking this is a difficult question to answer .i think that a lot of people would like to answer to this question because this involves a lot of economical and social interests .however , i ll try to express my ideas .when i was born ( 1970 ) there were fewer cars than today and even if the fuel is more and more expensive , the insurance is very expensive and cars are not cheap , the number of cars is increasing every year .this is due to a moderate growth of cars in the more industrialized countries but also to a rapid and uninterrupted economical growth of less developed countries .the continuous growth all over the world is requiring more and more mobility .it s understood that mobility does nt mean cars only .you may have trains , planes , ships and so on .but cars still remain the most diffused vehicle that people use to move from one place to another place .in my opinion it s also difficult to think about a reduction of the number of cars all over the world .we can think that in the near future the number of cars may decline in big cities due to the traffic which is already chaotic but this will be compensated by an impressive growth in other countries ( e.g. china , india and other growing countries ) .that s why it s very difficult to agree with the initial statement .it s also true to say that we all hope that the number of cars will not bring additional smog .what i hope is that new technologies will allow a more substainable growth .some of these new technologies already exist but are simply more expensive than gasoline .but i hope that electricity , hydrogen and hybrid vehicles will replace the traditional cars and will give us back blue skies , even in the big cities .cristian spallanzani
