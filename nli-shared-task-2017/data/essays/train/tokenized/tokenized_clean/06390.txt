there is a problematic situation : business has the main pourpose in selling and getting the heyer profit from anything and at the same time a correct life-style tells us that liyng is not correct ; it  s not always possible to follow both statements .of course i agree that advertisment makes a product seem much better than what it really is , because that s its pourpose : make a product look wonderful so nobody will resist buying it .not only publicity wants a product to look fantastic , it also wants you to think that it  s the best idea somebody ever had and that you can no longer live without it .advertisment want  s you to think that there product will better your life ; so why not buy it ?advertising uses those instruments that have the bigger impact on human personality : image , sound and psicology .psicology is one of the most powerfull wepons of control on people .if you are able to enter there mind with a powerfull and sensational icon you did it all .if you want to sell a hair lotion that will make your hair grow back eaven if you are sixty years old , you can  t say it will also seriously damage your hormon sistem or else i think every prson in the world would prefere to have a little less hair but a better helth .i think every person in the world should stop and think of it  s role in society and of what impact it have on people , each one of use should be aware of it  s own responsabilities and decide eather to take one way or the other : one leads , maybe , to a better world where everibody really has what is best , the otherone brings to a a world where each one of us thinks for him selve and thinks he is doing the best for him selve but he is not .
