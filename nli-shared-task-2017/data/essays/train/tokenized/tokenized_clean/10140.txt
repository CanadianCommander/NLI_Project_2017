it is a contradictory statement .first i agree because if a student learns ideas and concepts can take decisions .with an idea or concept a student can think about uses , aplications or simply examples of the topics from where it came .p.e. if you think on a different equipment that you can do with something cilinder ( the idea is the cilinder ) , you get aplications of it like you can do a drum , a tunnel , etc .ideas and concepts can be used to priorize different subjects and to focus on a principal goal to be sucessfully , p.e. if you get different ideas of an electrical problem that you have on class , like motors no running you can think about solution to solve it and be sucess like check the breaker , test the current before the motor or some others .sometimes is mixed the ideas and concepts get students to facts , and otherwise some facts , let students to get ideas and concepts .but second i have to disagree because when a student gets facts and learns from it , this knowledge let undertand what happen and can change the behavior of certainly act or activities , p.e. if you know that when you laugh in class disturb the class and the teacher is not feeling good with that behavior , and you are going to get your scores based on knowledge but also on certain appreciation of the teacher , you can modify it and do not laugh in so the teacher will be feel better with your presence and will be take it in consideration before put your scores .so this is a contradictory statement because for students both things are important to understand ideas and concepts in one hand but in the other to learn facts , and aplying all of this can get sucessfully .
