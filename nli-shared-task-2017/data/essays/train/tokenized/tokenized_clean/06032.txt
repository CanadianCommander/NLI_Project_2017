it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .my reason is memorazing a bunch of facts about a topic will not able to indentify and clearly understand the concept of the subject would be awful for the student .on the other hand only learning the facts about the subject the student only know about the coclusions .they always spend their times for memorazing the informations because of this many important hour for human life spend for nothing .the most important thing is understand the idea and the concepts .in my hometown , many of high schools  students have to pass an exam which is called oss which is for apply the university .the stundent responsibles of the four yerars high school educations .the problem is you have to memorize lot of facts and details about the questions .the details which she or he will forget after some decades days later .this situation shows that facts of students take the exam and they spend a lot of moneys and hour for nothing it was onlly about the pass the exam and a result of this preparation courses do not give a chence improve the your knowledge .in my opinion the students must be aducated in a traning which enables them to use their potentioanl about the subject .this kid of work gives a chance them to understand the ideas and concepts of work .in addition to this in an effective learning sytems for example learning with activities , diagrams , and traning useful for the students .the students could choose their courses to understand the ideas of the subjects and concets , because if the student wants to study abour for his or her master learniong facts doesnt help him or her .
