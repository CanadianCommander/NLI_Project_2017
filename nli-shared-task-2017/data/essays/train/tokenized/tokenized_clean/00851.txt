party going , loud , naughty , nasty fast drivers , rule breakers . ..these are some qualities that people accross nations , countires and communities associate youngsters with .they always think that it is them , who are the black sheep .they never look at the other side , this energetic group has to offer .agreed that they take a lot of things lightly , but when it comes to extending a helping hand towards community work , i strongly feel that they are the first ones to pitch in .there are many examples where young people have worked together in harmony to achieve results that were surprising .craig keilburger , matt johnson are two vivid and huge examples .`` kids can help the children  , thats what craig keilburger thought .he started campaigning in the united states at an early age of 15 .he wanted young people to come together , to share ideas and resources to reach one goal , that they all shared - ` make the children strong , for tomorrow they make the world strong  .his work started from his neighborhood in a small town in new york .he and his friends started by collecting old clothes , toys , books and even saved a part of their pocket money .once the collection was sufficient they would go out and distribute it among the needy and the desperate .he gained recognition and funds started to pour in , helping him expand his work from his neighborhood to the nation and finally to the entire globe .his foundation now consists of thousands of `` young  members who constantly work together .thanks to them , thousands of children accross the globe now have food to eat and schools to attend .craig is an example to big to believe ?wait until you hear about matt johnson .the johnsons lived in a slum in a chicago suburb that was famous for its notorious crack dealing .the policemen , the fire department , and even the medical emergency staff kept away from it .it all started when daphne , matt s friend got hit by a baseball during play .the ball hit her eye and was bleeding badly .they called 911 , but no help arrived and eventually she lost her eye .this angered matt to the limit .the next day onwards he started from the basic things like cleaning up his neghborhood , his friends joined him and they worked until they cleared all the bad notions that people had about their community .to sum it up , i think it would be very unfair on anyone s part to say that youngsters do not help in community work .i think that people must recognize their effort and appreciate it .
