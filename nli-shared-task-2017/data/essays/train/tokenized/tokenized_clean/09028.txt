to say : `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  is a joke .every year in this world the number of car circulating is increasing , new countries are developing , the work s market needs more flexibility and everyone of us want to have the freedom of going wherever and whenever we want .if we think about china we can see that it s trying to follow the first world with its economy so we can imagine that in the future they will follow our manners so probably they will wish as us a car for ownself and a car for their childs .if that happen the number of the cars will be necessarily higher than now .in addition the number of people living on earth is going to become bigger and so everyone will have his owncar .another problem that can increase the cars  number is that very often the public transport system is not very useful because there are not rides during the night or the frequency of the rides is not enough or the trains and buses are so busy and owercrowded that can be a real challenge to cach them .in addition , as happen very often in italy ( as today ) , the public transport is not available because the workers do nt go to work to protest with the government or with the employers on the other hand the number of available parking will be ever fewer and so that can be a deterrent to reduce the cars .in addition the request of fuel will be too much higher ( increased by the cars  number ) and as ever happen in the market the petrol price will be so high that someone will have to leave his own car at home using public transport .
