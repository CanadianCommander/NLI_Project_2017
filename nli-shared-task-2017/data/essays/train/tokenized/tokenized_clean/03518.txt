personally , i think that it is very important for students learning ideas and concepts .some people think the opposite , they think that it is better and useful learning facts , they are against theory , but without theory , it is more difficult learning facts .learning some concepts or ideas it is necessary , it is the basis to achieve good results .for example at university : if students do nt study some essential concepts of some subjects , they do nt understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a los of time .books have this purpose : telling the most important information , ideas about a specific argument .for example : students that want to become a doctor , before working have to learn some important concepts , they must know the human body .in every field of study , law , engeneery , science it is necessary having an abstract knowledge of the subject .after having known all the useful concepts and ideas , you can learn facts thanks to the experiences .certainly , learning the facts is important too , but after a comprehension of basic concepts .another example : in science or biology , people it is important knowing and understanding some concepts , such us dna and so on .csyudents when go to school should learn basic concepts and ideas .facts are useful too , in this way they can do a comparision in the reality .pobably , learning facts is less boring than learning some concepts , that sometimes can seem not useful , but students without this knowledge would nt have a whole understanding of a subject .
