have you ever try new things even though you knew risk is going to be extreme ?there are a few successful people who take chances and try new things , bill gates and steve jobs .two most reknown rival in the world .therefore i agree with the topic .first example is bill gates .in 2000 , sony s playstation 2 was the best game instrument in the world .any other companies did not even try to beat the power of ps2 .however , there were one man who chellenge sony s ps2 .bill gates demanded his workers to work on a game instrument .and eventually , he created x-box .he knew that risk would be gigantic enough to shut down his company for a while .despite of risk , his microsoft jumped into a game industry .in 2003 , microsoft made halo2 , which is considered as the greatest game of all time .second example is steve jobs , the ceo of apple inc .in san fransico , california , the mp3 companies were amazed by sudden appearance of ipod , which can hold up to 1,000 songs .because apple was a computer-making company , the other companies were surely surprized .according to steve job s biography , icon , he knew the risk was literally going to tear his company apart because of its financial problem .hw also knew that if he successes , it is going to resurrect apple .as you all know , ipod is success .there are a lot of successful people in the world , but a few try new things and willing to take chances rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .bill gates succees gaming industry while steve jobs dominated a fielid of mp3 .there is no doubt in my mind that successful people try new things .
