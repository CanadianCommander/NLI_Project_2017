the argument of people s view about having broad knowledge or specific knowledge deserves careful consideration because it s such a complex one .some people hold the opinion that broad knowledge of academic subjects will have more advantages than specific subject .in my point of view , i prefer having specific knowledge rather than broad one .there are numerous reasons why i think specific subject is good and i would in here explore a few of the most important ones .first of all , we come from a collaborational society , therefore , we need lots of different specilaists to improve our problems .it s even a tough job for a genium to invent or solve everything we need .we also know that every people has its adventages no matter he is clever or not , therefore , it s better to specialize in one specific subject .if we do that , it will explore more specialists to contribute their capacities to our society .another essential reason why i advocate this point is that we can establish our countries  economic position by cultivating such specialists .for example , in the past , taiwan , my country , is an agricultural country .later , our ex-precident , in order to make residents living better , tried to find out the better way to improve our economy .finally , he found that computer , internet would be the most popular products in the following century .therefore , he planed a policy which about training specialists , encouraging them go aboad to learn the skills .under such improvement , we transfer our economic system successfully .there is an argument to be made by the opposing position .they might say that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will enrich people s view .but the statement i have presented above , i do believe it s the most valid .
