i totally agree with the statement proposed .furthermore , for me this statement more than a prediction is a hope .with reference to this , it is very difficult to cram in few sentences my thougth about cars and the way people are used to using them nowadays .shortly , i think that people would not continue to use cars in such an eccessive way as they have been doing for fourty years , for the following reasons : the cost of the fuel ; air pollution ; development of new technologies in the civil transport sector .the main reason , at least in the nearer future , why people will will take the car more rarely is the increasing cost of the fuel .families have problems in facing such an expensive cost every day .in this respect , in my personal experience i already saw people living in my building starting substituting the car with a bycicle when they do not really have the need to drive .the second reason why people i think will certainly prefer to take a bus , or the underground instead of the car is represented by the air pollution .air pollution became a problem of critical importance in the cities .people can not freely breathe on the streets .the level of air pollution has reached unsustainable ceelings nowadays and people are more conscius about the problem and started thinking about it and trying to make an effort to solve the problem .finally , i think that people will definitly prefer to take a tram , or a bus , because the technology has made great steps .in the future there will be not traffic jam , but only fast and safe public transports in the cities .
