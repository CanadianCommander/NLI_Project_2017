i am agree the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the people always make the products seem much better then they really are .first , they always use the entertainment to show to the constumas .they will use a lot of ways to show to the people how good they are , and how usefull they are .secondly , when the people have make the products are not use the origanal of the item s use way to do , they have think a lot of the now function to make the people have to buy that .for example for the eye content .the eye content maker are not make the eye content for the people what they really need the eye content .althought , they make the eye content have a lot of the colors , and then given to the people want their eye change color and more petty .in my remenber , one day i had to go to buy the eye content .and then the saler had to ask me , `` are you looking for the eye content , we have some new arrivde .they have new function , they can make your eyes change the color .and she had say a lot of that product how good they are .the saler as like the eye content was she made .and i answer to her , `` oh really , i want to try that .so , i had to bougth that color eye content .and then , i had try that color eye content about two weeks .i feel my eyes really pain , and my friends always my eyes are vary red .so , i have went to check my eyes .and the doctor say ,  you have abslutely stop to use the color eye content , if you continus to use that , it will make your eyes bliend .that color eye content are not vary good for your eyes .so , i have stop to use that eye content .in my expericent and opinin , i have really agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the saler has say how good is the eye content , but te eye content are not really good as what was the saler say .and the eye content are not really can change your eye color .
