successful people try new things because a successful person always tries to be more successful by inventing or discovering some thing new .successfull people try things by taking risk .generally people get confidence , clout and motivation and professionalisms when they take risk to find new things .firstly , people who get encouragement will try to work more hard because it is human tendency generally we find this tendency in childern .but this also a hidden character of adults .it also works to my tendency .i even experienced this personly in my computer lab .once i acheived success in finding a program for project and i still try to find something new . .so this also increased my level of confidence towards the subject .secondly , scientists are the great examples because though they are successful in their career they alway pore their time to invent or dicover new things .usually scientist know how to do well but they take risk to find some thing new .here sientists are increasing their profeesionalism at the same time taking risk for finding new things .generally people get clout when they are trying new things .many people will valuable appreciations from others for their work .people generally dont appreciate all the for some people who dont takes risk and who always do the things what already know how to do well .as there is nothing greate in doing the things what they already know how to to well most successful people dont prefer to do only flasy people will try to do to show there unreal adeptness .in conclusion , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because success always independs on hardwork .
