due to the very fact that the question statement entails a broad generalization , i must disagree with it , as generalizations normally look inaccurate to me .notwithstanding , i would like to provide some personal insight in order to explain why i also disagree with such statement due to the fact that it looks , from my point of view , totally misleading .although we can find very different enjoyment levels in those persons around us , young people do not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do , and vice-versa .i acknowledge the fact that there are really happy young persons , but just as much as i acknowledge the fact that there are also lots of really happy older persons .i do believe , however , that both populations groups enjoy life somewhat differently : - while young people tend to have a more active lifestyle , generally doing more exercise and having a more intense social life , older people seem to have more sedentary habits , usually prefering to stay at home longer hours and also increasing the amount of time they spend with their spouses or families , at the expense of the time dedicated to social activities with non-relatives .- another difference that can explain why young and older people lifestyles differ so much is the level and nature of their responsibility .younger people can usually enjoy themselves without having to worry too much for anybody else , as they do not normally have children or grandchildren to feed and take care of .on the other hand , older persons are generally responsible , at least partially , for the education and the welfare of their offspring , which although entails quite a bit of time and effort , is often regarded of as a very rejoycing experience .- last , but not least , the level of physical and mental health has also a great impact on both young and older people .while the former generally enjoy stronger and healthier bodies that help them carry out and enjoy more intense physical activities , the latter are normally considered to be wiser and more experienced , and therefore better positioned and endowed to enjoy the quieter pleasures that life offers and fight the battles that it often presents .the above reasons help me explain why young and older people can enjoy life equally , despite having very different lifestyles !
