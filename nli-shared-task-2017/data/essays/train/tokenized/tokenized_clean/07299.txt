in my personal opinion i am disagree with the question , becuase if you travel in a group you need too go to the same place that the other people of the group want .maybe if the group is integrated by people that i know , is fine , because i could have the thrust to said if something or some place dont like me , but if the group is integrated for people that i do not know i preffer to travel just with one friend or one sister becuase we could go to any place where we want and when we can .the idea of have a tour guide is good because we can know a lot of places and things without the necesity of are asking all the time to the people around about the places to visit in the city .in other hands if you have a tour guide the trip will be more enjoyable becuase the tour guide give you all the information necesary that you need to enjoy your estance in the place or city , maybe the cost that you need to pay to the tour guide will be expensive but will be more expensive go from one place to another without know in reality that you want .i think that in some cases you need a person who lead you and help you in your trip .for example in a museum is good that you have a person who explain you about the exposition get the best benefit and know the hole place .in my personal experience last year i traveled to guanajuato in a group integrated for friends , and it was a great experience .we did not have a tour guide but before the trip we made sure of know exactly what places were available to visit , we looked for the cost of hotels and the tipical things to do in that city searching by internet and the result was a really good trip and we dont need to pay a tour guide and we salved money to spend in other things .
