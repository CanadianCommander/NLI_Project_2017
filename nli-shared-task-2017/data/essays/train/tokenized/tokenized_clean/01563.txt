cars are one of the most useful and important inventions .there are millions and millions of cars in each country nowadays , but for the continuous incresing in the number of people living on earth and technology reasons i think that there will be less cars to use in the world in twenty years .the first reason is that the number of people living in the plant is increasing every day .i read an article once that said that over 100000 babies are born each day , but only less than half of that number of people die each day .it will surely be very cowded by 2026 and much more people will be living on earth than now .houses will be built and more buildings will exist .parking lots will always be full and there will never be enough space to drive a car on the street .the second reason is that in twenty years cars may not be as useful as they are now .little , cheap airplanes might be invented and on the roof of each house there might be space to park it .on top of each buiding there might be a parking lot on the roof for planes to land .cities might all be connected with underground trains and no cars would be needed .it is amazing how everything is changing in a short time .100 years ago there were no cars at all and we can not imagine how peolpe used to live , and in a short term of time there might be a new invention and people would imagine how `` we  used to live !
