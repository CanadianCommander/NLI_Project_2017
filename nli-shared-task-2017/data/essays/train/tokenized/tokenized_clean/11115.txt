i agree with the opinion to specialize in one specific subject .and i will tell you about the reason why i think so .at first , recently academic subjects is developing rapidly , and unless you have a deep knowledge about the subject you learn , you ca nt understand anything about that .before twenty century , the field of academic was not broad and not vast , so many specialist could learn many fields , but now we ca nt .second , the person who is the expert in one specific subject will get a lot of award .for example , nobel prize will hand in the specialist of one region like medical , piece , chemistry , physics and so on .though this is an extreme example , if one person would know any sperficial knowledge of any subject , the person wo nt get the nobel prize .at last , learning broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very difficult .as the matter of fact , there is a `` liberal arts  in the university of the us , and university student is trying to study a lot of broad knowledge .but completing `` liberal arts  is very difficult in four year .sometimes studying makes some university students exhausted .so studying only one subject deeply is the good way for university students .alhough i explain how bad studying broad knowledge is , there is one good point to study `` liberal arts  .if you know a lot of knowledge outside your speciality , sometimes you can get some ideas for your speciality .because there are a lot of similarity between the subject to subject , you can be easy to hit the idea if you are trouble to write a paper or something else .in the conclusion , if you have a much time to study in your life , studying `` liberal arts  at first and then studying your speciality will be the best way to complete your way of academics .
