there are several advantages as well as disadvantages of whether an individual posseses a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects or merely one specific field of study .to my mind it is necessary and helpful to gain , at least to some extent , a bit of each of this two opposing kinds of knowledge .firstly , it can be said that specializing in a certain subject is definitely very helpful with regard to one s future career .if a person has accumulated a lot of knowlegde about one topic in a very detailed way it enables him to work very effectively in that area .having a lot of knowledge usually also implies a lot of abilities one is able to perform in a suitable job position .furthermore , with a lot of detailed knowledge one could contribute to the advance of the studied field in various ways .for instance , somewho who has studied the development of one specific topic of research such as group processes , is able to use his knowledge to actually design new experiments which might change the current point of researching concerning that area .this would definitely push one s career towards greater success or maybe even fame .in contrast to that , a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects also has some benefits to offer .it implies that one does know about a large variety of topics in a general manner .this variety not only broadens your horizon , but it also offers you new perspectives and gives you insight into maybe even quite contrasting topics .whenever you need to apply or know about one specific subject in a more detailed way , you can still do that and just enlarge your former information .however , to my mind , neither of the two ways of knowledge taken on their own are appropriate and suffiencent enough .the ideal solution would be a combination of the two : a great amount of specialized knowledge which qualifies one for a job position on a high level ; and some broad knowledge about a variety of topics and issues .to conclude this would enable each type of knowledge to benefit from the other and give the individa
