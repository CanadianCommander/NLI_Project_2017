some people in japan , where i live , the life old people has is more enjoyable , but i think young people enjoy life more than old people for the following reasons .first , youg people can do many sports without concerning about their bodies .for example , when i was a student at kaisei high school , one of the best universities in japan , i was on a baseball team whose name was swallows .even now , i can remember those days easily .i practiced baseball with my friends every day .that was the most enjoyable time for me .it was not matter for me whether i could catch ball .the most impotant thing was doing my best for catching white balls .the moment when i jump in to the ball was the best moment .so , i think without exciting sports it the life is not enjoyable .second , the happiness to go to school is what only young people can get .for example , when i was a student at waseda university in tokyo , japan , i had a school festival .our group decided to open waseda cafe .though we used a lot of time and money , we were happy because we could get important friendships .so , i think school is very good .as the reasons and examples show , i strongly believe that young people can have much more enjoyable time than that older people have .
