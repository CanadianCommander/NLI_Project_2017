the issue at hand is whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today .the question is very interesting since the number of cars used have a tremendous influence on our environment because of the pollution .i personally believe that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than today .the first reason i think this is because the number of people who can afford a car is constantly growing .although we do nt know how the economical structure will look like in twenty years we have to expect that in the big countries like china and india more people will earn enough money to buy a car for their personal need .another reason why i assume that more cars will be on the road is based on the assumption that the people s search for individualism is constantly growing .many people do nt want to be limited by public transportation to get to their destinations .they use their car to travel whenever they want to the places they would like to be .they re not limited by timetables or the locations of the train/bus stations .my final thought which supports my opinion is that cars are also a sign of wealth .in contrast to the people who can afford one car for their personal transportation there will be many people who earn enough money to have even more than one car and that only for the purpose of fun .there are a lot of couples without children who have 3 cars .one car for each person for the daily use and the third car , for example a sports car or a convertrible car , for special occasions .there are also a lot of collectors of very old cars , called oldtimers .concluding the arguments above i can say that we should definitely expect more cars on the road in twenty years than today .
