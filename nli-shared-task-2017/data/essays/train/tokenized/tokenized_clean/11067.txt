there will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years later surely .nowadays , there are trends not having any cars , encouraging the use of public transportation , and the attempts to invent more effective transportation .it is due to many contemporary car problems : serious traffic jamming , environment pollution and lacking of oil .first of all , one of the reasons i expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jam on our roads is incredibly severe now .in some countries like korea , the land are very densely populated , there are excessive cars on the road , there happens the traffic jamming even on the highway road .not only for korea , it is the worldwide problem .many country are suffering from traffic jam .government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jam .and one other problem as serious as above is the environmental thing .car causes pollution in many ways , most seriously , the engine gas of cars make the sky foggy and dirty .it causes contagious eye diseases , and respiratory problems .in adittion , it promotes the global warming which is making mankind very afraid of .the carbon dioxide in the engine gas make the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth .and then the water level uprises and covers available land of us .maybe we lose our whole earth to live .if cars wo nt decrease , there will happen a crisis of the entire human race .moreover , the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now , and in about 40 years , there will be no oil to depend on .in present point of view , we ca nt live without oil and gas .they are used to make fabrics , circulating plants and factories , and more and more .if we use all of them driving car , the thing will happen a lot sooner .so till we have a great resource to replace oil and gas , we should try to save it and invent other kind of transportions which are not taking any oil .in the points of view above , there are too many problms with abundance of cars .so for people to live , in the global view , they will not have cars .ultimately we will be able to see not jamming roads and clearer sky with fewer cars in the road .
