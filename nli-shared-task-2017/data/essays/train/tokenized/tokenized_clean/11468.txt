today , we are living in an age of consumption , by consuming various products either because we vitally need them or we are conditioned to do so .as a consequence we are destined to make continuos choices about our consumption and advertisements hold an unavoidable place in the process .the way we determine our choices among , more or less equally qualified , products is connected to the way they are promoted to us to a great extent .there are two ways that the advertisemets take hold of our choices , first , they associate superior qualities to a product , apart from the reality behind .as an example to such a situation , we can look at an experiment made my coca-cola experts testing their new formulation of coke , in late 1980s , to reveal the reason behind the steep decrease in the sales .when the experts made people try both coca-cola and pepsi , without indicating their brands , even the coca-cola fans were not able to distinguish between the two brands and chose pepsi , as being coca-cola .the main outcome of the experiment was the indication that coca-cola fans were overall choosing the brand based upon bombardment of advertisements , instead of a distinct difference in taste .the second role of advertisements to promote a product is to associate it with another aspect of life , generally with satisfaction of another need .for example , in most of the advertisements of gilette , we see a sexy guy , half-naked , shaving himself and being adorned by women .such advertisements give the message of : shaving with gilette makes you attractive for women , is an important tool in increasing the sales of the product , by implicitly satisfying a subconscious desire of men .overall , it becomes apperant that , in a world of choices accompanied by numerous products on shelfs , advertisements manipulate our actions .that is why big corporations invest millions of dolars in advertisement , as a sign of huge gains coming from advertisements .at this point , it is our responsibility , to make most keen choices by comparing the quality of a product with its price .
