i do not subscribe to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .students should be more focussed on getting the facts right as facts hold them are unalterable and are bound to hold them good in long stead .what may seem a great idea to one person may be perceived as unfeasible and dismissed by another idea from person who has taken a different approach .ideas can be whimsical and outlandish .they can even range from bizzare to plain absurd .it is here that facts stop whimsical ideas to take flight and cause unnecessary wastage of time and effort by a team of creators .let me quote a recent example .donald trump , the real estate mogul from new york , mooted the idea of the new season of hit tv series , the apprentice on racial lines .the contest was previously held between university graduates and non degree holders .for the latest season he came up with the idea of the contest taking place between colored and white people .the idea , before it could shape up further , drew huge criticism and widespread uproar among the society as to how come racism form the basis of a tv show that is essentially a recruitment process which is broadcast all over the country and abroad forcing trump to abandon the idea and issue an apology .this idea would never have been come up , if donald trump had acquainted himself with the fact , that anything remotely racist would be condemned widespread as racism in any form is still a sensitive issue .this is not to say that ideas and concepts should be trashed away completely .they should be allowed to prosper only after the facts have been taken into account .facts form the basis of ideas and concepts and unless a student has got his facts in place , he will not be able to come up with original and progressive ideas .a building can not be stable when the very foundation of it is weak and infirm .
