this is a controversial topic since the conditions are different for different countries .firstly in todays world of development and technology , there are many distractions like the video games , movies , computers and gadgets like the ipod .some people feel that community work like visiting oldage homes is a waste of time .they feel that they can do things which are more useful fot the person than the community during that period of time .it is sometimes this casual attitude due to which people lose interest in their community .there are other factors which have led to the decrease in participation in the commuinty .youth over the ages have felt that the commuinity in some is demoralizing them .for example in india , due to the poor conditions of the country , a child feels that why should he or she give something to the community if the community has nt done enough for him or her .if this trends goes on increasing then lesser number of children will not try to help their community .sometimes it depends how the child has been brought up .if the family never did anything for the community then it is bound that the child might do the same .with this negetive attitude i do nt feel that it will ever help anyone , neither the youth nor the community .however i think its not the same everywhere .i tend to do a lot for my community .as a family tradition every year my mother and i visit the local old age home and spend hours talking to them .during festive seasons , we get clothes and food for the old people and even try to bring in more activities for them .this has helped me to understand elders better and respect them .this year i participated in a progam of ` each one teach one  where we got a chance to teach little children from slum areas .this was one of my most gainful experience and it helped me to be more optimistic .i take part in several projects related to saving and planting more trees , cleaning the school campus , taking care of school animals for which i have recieved an award .every year we collect old clothes for the poor in our school and neighbourhood .in conclusion , it seems that the negetive attitude of the younger generation is declining its intrest in the community .it is not right because one can not expect the community for us .we as a member of the community have to lend a helping hand in small areas like helping in oldage homes , teaching children who do not have proper means of education .according to me its a give and take relationship .this means in order to recieve something from the community we need to put in our part of the effort and have a positive outlook towards all this and only then will our community will give something in return .but i think someone has to start this cycle and only the younger youth can .
