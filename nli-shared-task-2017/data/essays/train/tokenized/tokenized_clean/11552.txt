sadly , i do not think that in the future there will be less cars in use than nowadays .although , i would really appreciate that , i really doubt it , because the possibility that people all start using the train or even that our government will prohibite cars in the cities , is quite small .still , i think it would be a huge achievement to reduce traffic on our streets .the horriblest thing in cities are the overcrowded streets , the noise of the traffic and the pollution cars cause .still , i am sure cars will not get out of favour , because people are obsessed with them .i know several people , who buy very expensive cars , they can not even afford to buy .just because it is an huge status symbol and everzone loves to brag about it .people may argue , that oil prizes will increase so much , that the ordinary man can not afford to keep a car , but i think that the industry already has good alternatives .natural oil , a gas or solar driven cars are alreadz developped and fully functioning .but these cars are still so expensieve or weird looking that people do not want to buy them .in conclusion , there is no reason why there should be fewer cars in use than there are today .furthermore , several third and second world countries ( like china and india ) are developing to industrial states and therefore , they will even need more cars .in an utopian world there would not be any cars and all people would have access to trains , which would provide the transportation .
