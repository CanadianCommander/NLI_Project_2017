the idea that young people nowadays do not devote enough time , and thus have become less altrustic towards their communities than before , is a common mistake .this idea comes from a well known process which leads the formation of several other prejudices ( like , for example , the idea that home made products are always better than industrial ones ) .this phenomenon , which i would call ` the myth of old times  , is based on the common perception that younger generations are much more egoist and greedy than older ones .it is often thought , especially in ageing societies , like in our wealthy western nations , that younger people intrinsically lack values , and for this reasons do not do enough for their communities .it is certainly true that there has been an evolution towards societies more based on individuals and it is also true that the time shedule of the people have started to be impressingly filled by many activites .but this does not authomatically lead to the statement that young people are egoists towards thier communities .first , this increased individualism and time shortage applies to all the age groups in an equal manner , and second , nowadays communities have much less needs which must be satisfied by the commitment of young people .examples of this type are elderly healthcare , childcare , and a lot o small activities such as taking water from the river , etc etc .therefore decreased needs mean decreased needs of time to devote .if one tries to honestly look at the evidence , the data suggests that the commitment towards volounteer organization has grown steadily and strongly among young people in the last decades .nowadays , the work of young people for their community , though certainly changed in its organization , looks much more effective ( also due to technological progress ) and genuinely driven by the will of helping other people than before .there are thousands of junior volounteering groups all across united states witnessing this fact .for these reasons , i strongly disagree with the passage and i believe that nowadays young people devote quite a reasonable amount of time to help their communities .
