i agree with the statement that successful people rather try new things and like to take risks than doing what they can already do .when you already know that you can do something , it s just normal that you try a new thing .everybody wants to try new things .small children are the best examples .when they are able to sit , they want to be able to walk .they get up and try to do so until they are able to do so .you re coming further when you try new things , you get new experiences as well .there s another example .if i m able to read a german book easily , it s just normal that i start to read englisch books .i started reading englisch books when i was in grade 5 .i already could read german books and was successful in reading german , so i tried so get some new experience and wanted to try a new thing .taking risks is the same .people who are successful are often also secure .you only take risks when you feel stable at a certain level .successful people always stand on a certain level , so they are more willing to take risks .there s also an example .if someone just built a house and now has many dues at the bank , he wo nt lend his neighbour much money .he s unsecure about his financial situation and therefore now is more cautionous .all in all , you can say that successful people always take risks and want to try new things .they feel secure in their life because they are satisfied with their situation at the moment .they therefore can risk something .it s easier to risk something when you are secure .you ca nt lose as much as someone whose situation is insecure at the moment .another point is that sometimes you can be bored if you always do the same things .to get out of boredom , you start to do new things and also take risks .to summarize , i agree with the statement .
