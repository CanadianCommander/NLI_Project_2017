i aree only partially with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they do well .although , trying newer things keeps up the growth graph and helps a person to rise above the rest but equally true is the fact that one can be equally successful in some thing in which he or she has both , experience and expertise .to excel in any field , its extemely crucial to know ones job correctly and efficiently .this excellence can be achieved by hard work and spending more time on the job at hand .in other words , experience and diligence is the key to success .for this reason , i belive that those people who do the same thing over a long period of time or do it well , do become successful .for example , a mechanic specializing in repairing electronic gadgets can achieve enough success even if he sticks to that very job forever .people shall always trust him more than the neophytes in the profession .however , if he changes his job or tries to multitask in more number of jobs , he might end up spoiling his established work and not even getting the customer s support in the new area in which he will now become a beginner .however , trying out different things in life can not be seen with any contempt .it is always said that if you stop growing , you would soon start declining .staying in just one thing and doing nothing else can easily stagnate a person and stagnant water is worth nothing more than a breeding place for mosquitoes and deadly diseases .therefore , it is as proper to keep experimenting in life .one should always learn newer and better stuff and become adroit in them .at the same time , one must never forget to keep in touch with the original talent and maintain it .conclusively , whether you decide to stay in your discipline , or diversify , success can be all yours , provided , you do it with sincerity and hardwork .
