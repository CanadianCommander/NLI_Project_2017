the are a quite many aspects in favor of the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts as there are aspects against it .i agree with the statement that for students it is a lot more important to understand ideas and concepts .students not only need to have a basic knowledge of the facts , they also need to create a certain ability to transfer their knowledge .transfering their knowledge means that problems and questions that arise during their studies are sometimes not solvable by purely learning facts and reproducing them .many times it is necessary to see interconnections between topics or solutions , for instance in a mathematical equation .if a student has to solve a difficult equation it is essential to come up with some idea how to solve it .knowing algebra and calculus is one thing , however , the student needs to know how to apply his knowledge in order to solve the mathematical problem .thus , learning facts will not lead him to the solution .instead , understanding the idea of multiplying , adding , subtracting or dividing equations with a clear concept gehing it will lead him into the right direction .by coming up with a neww concept students are force to think a lot more and make up their mind than by learning facts .it is therefore easier for them to come up with conceptual ideas and new strategies .on the other hand it is important for a student to have a profound knowledge which he will only obtain by learning facts .learning facts means that a student will most of the time not run into a situation where he has gaps and will not be able to respond to a fact question .for lawstudents for instance , it is crucial to have a profound knowledge of facts .as a matter of fact , learning facts means that you train your brain and you will be able to memorize things better than others .additionally learnig facts enables students to expand their knowledge about all kinds of topics .depending on the major it is probably more important for a law student to be able to summarize facts , whereas a philosophy student is expected to understand ideas and concepts .
