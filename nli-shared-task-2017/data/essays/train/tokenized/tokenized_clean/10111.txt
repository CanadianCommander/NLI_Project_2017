when i talk to older people , for example to my grandparents , they give me the advise to always enjoy every hour of my life as this time will never be given back to me .also , they say that i should enjoy life while i m still young as i have more possibilities - maybe not financially , but regarding my health and the time i have .i m still very young , at the beginning of my twenties to be exactly , and , yes , so far i really enjoyed life .however , lacking the personal eperience of how life changes and how one actually enjoys life when being older , makes this question hard to answer .to answer this question , i d like to look at the things which change when a person is older .one of these things is responsibility .as a child , i did nt have the feeling of being responsible for anything .without being worried about other persons ( as my parents were with me , for example ) , i could enjoy life more effortlessly .also , becoming older means to be faced with other problems .as a child or teenager , i was not really worried about the question of how to earn my money , how to put food on the table , when to fill out my tax forms , or how to solve problems in my relationship .however , as a teenager , i experienced an increased responsibility for my education .i had to go to school every weekday , i had to finish my homework and hand in my assignments in time .these tasks definately were nt very helpful in enjoying my life .due to the time older people have to spend on their job and getting other tasks done , they have less time to do things they actually enjoy - unless you enjoy your work more than anything else .i know many people who enjoy the work they are doing but would rather do something else even more enjoyable , like studying a topic they are really interested in , go hiking , see some friends , or travel .however , even though younger people have more time to do all these things - students , for example , have long summer breaks - most young people lack the money to afford all these things .also , due to laws and regulations , younger people may not be able to do certain things that older people can do .driving a car was something i would definately have enjoyed when i was six years old ( i still do now , though ) , however , i was not allowed to do it .there are also things which are not appreciated by younger people as things that make live more enjoyable .visiting a classical concert or just watching a sunset might be such an example .for many adults or older people , having an own family is the most important thing to have an enjoyable life .given the examples and explanations above , i generally agree with the statement , mainly because of the less responsibilities young people have , the less problems they are confronted with , and because of the time they have available .looking at it in a philosophical way , one must not forget the other side to this discussion , which is that older people have the experience and matureness to appreciate certain things more which make their live enjoyable .however , for me it definately seems that younger people have more fun , are more active and get to know more new people .also , there is still this curiosity about new and unexperienced things , which makes life very enjoyable .however ,
