it is the hardest choice on everyone s academic path .someone thinks it is better to specialize as soon as possible , others think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i think children and teenagers should learn as much as possible on many different subjects and during university they should specialize in one specific subject .when i think about great scientists in the past century i am surprised .they all had a broad knoweldge in many different fields sometimes very different from each other .for example leonardo davinci was the greatest painter , philosopher and scientist of his time .i thinks nowadays it is not possible to reach a deep knowledge in many different field because of the increasing complexity in every subject , furthermore i think it is better to gain a deep knowledge in something than to have broad and superficial knowledge of many different subjects .specializing in one field is very usefull for two different reasons .the fisrt one is that specialized student likely will find job easier because our society is interested in woorkers with specialized and advenced skill .the second reason is that if you specialize you bacame aware of the complexity of the subject .even if a person will work in a different field with respect to the field in which he has studied , he has learned to face difficult and complex problem and it is will turn to be extremely helpfull .if one learns many different subjects he likely will know just the basic ideas and he will not develop his ability to fix complex problems .althought i thinks it is important to specialize in one subject i also belive students should be able to try many different subjects before choosing their field .it is difficult to inderstand what you are really interested in .trying is the best way to make a good choice .for this reason i think university should allowed first year student to change their major without any charge or penalties .
