i do nt think that spending time for this reason is not really important anymore . .but it s true , young people do not spend a lot of their time helping their communities .should they really do this ?what for ?there are other things they have to concentrate on , such as school and work .a few years ago , it was probably different and it was more common to spend time helping their community , but everything is changing , for example people and life .young people really have to do much more than people the same age a couple of years ago .young people really have to work hard to finish school , to find the right job and to be sucessful in life .there are many other things that are much more important than spending time with helping their community .young people should better hold on to their dreams and the government should hire people to do the work that has to do with the community .there are so many people without work , even if it s not the best paid job , they will be happy to find a job instead of sitting on their ass at home , watching tv without doing anything challenging .we do nt want lazy people in our contry , the worst thing is that we have to pay for this kind of people and we do nt want that , people get angry when they think about that .we want them to work , to work as hard as we do and to gain their own money .i disagree with the statement above because of the facts i mentioned in this essay .this essay definitely makes clear what i think about it , and that there is no need for young people to help in their community , because we want the government to do something !!!
