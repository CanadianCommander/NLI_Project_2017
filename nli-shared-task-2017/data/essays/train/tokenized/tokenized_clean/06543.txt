the car is one of the most important machines the man have created .human life have changed a lot since this machine , that at first was exclusive but that now is consider as one of the most necesaries , was invented .the car has become one of the most important ways of moving around .it is used for every type of trips : long trips , where its use is less common , or short ones , that we ca not imagine doing without sitting at the wheal .new generations had become more dependents on cars than old ones .nowadays the cities are not biuld for walking .the distances from one place to another are so big that noone can go walking from here to there without getting exahusted .the new type of city makes the need for cars greater : the jobs are usually allocated on the city , but the houses are placed on the suburbus .for example in the states they are areas for everything , nothing is mixed .with this what i mean is that the houses are all together , then you have the moll area , then you have the area where the office are placed etcetera .some people will say that public transport could make or need for cars lighter , but the truth is that it does not work .people drive cars because they have concrete needs that they need to fullfil .for example there is never the same bus that takes you to the grocery store , the school where your kids study and your own house .it is simplily easy to drive your car wherever you need to .this are some of the reasons of why i belive that in twenty years ther will be more cars in use than there are today , beacause as the time goes by the need becomes greater .
