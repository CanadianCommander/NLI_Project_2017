today in our world no one can not count his success without taking risk .if one wants to successful he must have to take risk .without risk one can not success .i m agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already known how to do well .first , successful people have good expiriance about his business so they wants to use his expiriance in other business .by doing this they also know new things and also knowing new business stretergys .these stretergy helps them to creat their business more powerfull and strong .for ex. recently a popular industrialist from india under take a gient steel company of europe .his exprince helps him to buy this company .second , successful people are already having good setteld business so they can give their more time to new business which they started .by taking this risk , starting new business they also come in touch of new people from another industries .by comung in touch of these people one can study another industries and it help him lot in new business risk .a business man started softwear comoany but he does note have expiriance about it but keeping touch with other i.t companies it helps him lot in his new business .third reason is successful people have already earn good amount of mony from their business so they have good balance of mony to spend on new business .they allways wants to be successful so they never think about risk .it is true that successful people try new things and take risk but in todays competitive world every one have to take risk to became successful .if one take risk for being successful his chance will incresing to be a sucessful .
