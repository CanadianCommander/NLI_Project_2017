young people often in general have a bad image .they only want to make party , they make a lot of noise , they do not really care about their future and they do not invest any of their time to help their communities .this is a opinion that is pretty widespread , especially under elderly people .but is that really true ?is our youth that much spoiled and destroyed ?i think there are also many situations which show exactly the opposite .especially in the united states , where volunteer work has a very high meaning , many young people spend much of their free time helping communities .they work with children , they work with elderly people or they engage in protecting the environment .in those states , volunteer work is highly admired and schools would support it a lot .probably in european countries like switzerland or germany , this is not really the case .volunteer work is not that commun and it might not be that often the case that young people engage in it .this can also be a result by the fact that schools do not support it enough and do not make it popular enough .but very often , helping the communities may also be acted out in a form , that is not that formal or public as it is when a individual does volunteer work .for instance it might also be a helpful act of young people when they help an elder individual crossing the street .or when they show them how to use a ticket machine at a train station .so all the helpful acts can also be acted out in daily life .for sure , such acts are often done by young people , but that is not really recognized because it is not that public .assumed that young people in our days really do not help their communities enough .what could be a reason for it ?it might be that young people are just under more pressure than they were in ancient times .the economy is not that stable at the moment , jobs are rather rare and one has to work against a lot of competitors to find his job position .therefore a lot of effort has to be put into working on the career and make sure that one finds a good working place .it often can be the case that there is simply not enough time left to do some social work .and in our material western society , finances and a wealthy life are for most of the people more important than conducting a social life .based on all those facts .i agree that young people generally do not put so much effort into helping their communities in a public form .for instance they do not help a lot in the church or in childcare or in environmental groups .but probably they do a more hidden kind of helping their communities simply by acting out some social acts in their daily life .
