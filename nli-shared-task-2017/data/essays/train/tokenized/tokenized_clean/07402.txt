i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is more important then to learn facts .this is because it helps the students to understand the material better .also , it builds up the ability for the students to think .in addition , it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinion .firstly , it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps the students to understand the material better .for example math is the subject that does not involve much concept .one has to accept the facts and apply it to other mathematical equation .although the teacher teaches individual the proof of the math theory , it does nt help much to understand the concept of it .one has to accept the fact and practice that fact so that it becomes easier to apply it to the equation .therefore it is harder to understand the material .on the other hand in biology class learn the facts and do several lab experiments to understand the idea and the concept .in biology class it is easier to understand the material since it shows the procedure of where and how the facts relate to the facts .it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps one to understand the material better .secondly , it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it helps the students to build up the ability for the students to think .for example english class , i simply memorise the answer to the questions , therefore i do not get to think how it is the answer to the questions .my thoughts on that material is limited .on the other hand in psychology class it shows the procedure and concept of a particular study , i get to think how much the results of the study is valid and if there is an ethical considerations for it .by understanding the concepts and ideas it helps the students to build up on their ability to think .thirdly , it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts because it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinion .for example simply memorizing the facts does not help much for one to raise their own opinion , since one does not know the concept or the idea how the specific material became a fact .when one understands the concept and the idea of an specific material , the individual would have their own thoughts about the specific material , since we are not a robot and have own opinions .therefore the students will not hesitate of addressing their own opinion because they can back their opinions with various reasons since they understand the ideas and concepts .as a conclusion , i think it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because it helps the students to understand the material better .also , it builds up the ability for the students to think .moreover , it increases the ability for the students to raise their own opinions .
