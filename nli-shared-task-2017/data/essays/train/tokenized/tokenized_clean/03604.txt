today , many older people tend to travel all around the world , live in abroad , enjoy their hobbies , going to older people s school for talking and playing with same age people after retiring their jobs .thus , i disagree with this statement `` youn people enjoy life more than older people do .many travel companies tend to make travel plans and long-stay in abroad plans for only older people these days .for example , my parents are thinking of traveling all around the world and living in abroad to relax and enjoy their rest of life after retiring their jobs .my university teacher has been talking same kind of things .in addition , i know some older people who live in abroad .i agree with their thinking because they have worked very hard and have not seen the whole world .older people can have a lot of free time to enjoy their hobbies .they do not need to care about time .thinking about young people , they also have free time when they are students .during going to school , they can travel , study about their interests , stick to their hobbies .however , after graduating school , they need to work and they have much less free time .thus , i think older people enjoy life same as young people do .or might enjoy more than young people becuase they do not need to anything .in my opinion , i would like to enjoy retired life , but i would like to enjoy more when i am young .this is because to get a job which i want to do , and to get a happy life , i need to see the world by own my eyes .traveling around the world is very fun to me , and this would also benefit my future .by the way , i really hope that my parents would have very enjoyable life after retire .
