enjoyment has nothing to do with the age but has lot more to do with heart , ability and more importantly with the conditions that a person is in .and for that reason i think that even the older people get to enjoy their life maybe in different ways but they do enjoy their life .young people get to enjoy on the dance floors or in the college cafetaria .similary the older generation get to enjoy and spend their time in their own thougful and entertaning ways .one and easily see lots of older people in the parks , enjoying walking , chit-chatting or enjoying various other activites their such as gardening , laughing clubs etc cetera .the park next to our society is one such living example .one can easily find lots of older people lottering either alone or in company of their friends or grandchildrens .again older people are free from most of the tensions and duties such as money matters , family matters and thus lead more carefree life with ample amount of free time to spent as they please and in fullfilling their wishes and inventing new hobbies .for example their is an old couple staying next to my house who have taking clay modeling as their new hobbie .lot of others prefer either reading , writing , travelling or enjoy spending time in various social activites , at religious places or playing around with their grandchildrens .some people argue that older generation are weak and lack enough energy to enjoy life .yes old age do comes with its own proplems such as health problems and low enery levels but this is old time story .one can easily find out the number of older people enjoying and living their life to fullest .for example the prime minister of india , the president of united states of america along with lots of other national and internation examples are openly challanging this view .for the above stated reasons i feel that even older people gets to enjoy their life maybe in their own way and not as the yong generation but their do enjoy their life ,
