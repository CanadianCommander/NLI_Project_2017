nowadays most fortunate human beings have access to an endless amount of data through many ways : internet , books , ...this gives them a wide knowledge on how to use ideas and concepts when learning facts implies knowledge without understanding .on one hand we ll deal with the advantages and disadvantages of learning facts and on the other hand with those of understanding ideas and concepts .mankind has evolved a lot and research followed .through the centuries humans discovered so many things that a lot of them are even inaccessible for most of us today .when dealing with how human body works we ca nt even see half of what makes us but thanks to new technologies some people can see microbes , viruses and understand how they create our mood , diseases or else .most of us could nt even verify most of this explanations but good thing is we can learn them and use them in many fields so that we re not bound to what we can see or understand simply .while learning gives us many informations on some things , understanding ideas and concepts is more likely to help us in our lives .as a matter of fact , neither knowing that cellulas split nor that 2 + 2 = 4 can guide us while having to resolve a situation .if people learn ideas and concepts they can apply them in many ways afterwards in everyday life .moreover , this can lead to new thoughts and new approaches on some subjects like religion while learning facts is a way of narrowing human thinking and bounding knowledge to what we can learn without thinking .to conclude , i would rather understand few main concepts and ideas of life that i could use in many situations than learning thousands of interesting things that i could never understand .
