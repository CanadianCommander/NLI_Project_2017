the idea is good to me .i think that the most important aspect for the wisdom is to understand the ideas and concepts that we have heard in the school .for the students is important too the comunication with the porfessor .but no always the situation is the most comfortable for the students and the academic .many times , the place where the student show their questions not is in the classroom .when anybody do nt understand something in the class is necesary to explain other time .we know that to learn is not a simple work , each mind is different and the level of complexity change in each human .when a professor is not sure that hir pupils have understood the principal idea of the tem he must do questions about the exposition , if the answeres are correct he can go on but if he comprove the other situation he can teach the problem once more .but the reality is nt , many time , simple .the situation is complicate when the people do nt understand nothing about the explication but do nt pay attention or because a problem of concentration .the pschycological studies have been demostred us that mind work more slowly in this century .why , in our century , not only the students , in general , the people have a big problem to understand and learn new things ?why our mind work more slowly ?about this quaestion the pscycologist richard frazer says : the television and the other machines , products of the xx century are the cause of the massive slownees of the wordl .the human thinks the computer , the television , tha games and others ahve been invented to help us , to do life mor easy and fast , but is no true .
