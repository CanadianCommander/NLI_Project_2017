indeed i disagree that young people enjoy their life more than old people because i believe that old people have more time to enjoy themselves , have less responsibilities and have a good life experience and resources which they can use to enjoy themselves .old people usually have much time for enjoyement .they are almost retired after they finished their work time and so they will concentrate on enjoying theirselves through travelling abroad or did their own favorite hobbies like reading , painting , etc . ..other important thing which enable elderly to enjoy their life is the fact that they are free .they have no much responsibilities to do .they are already retired from work so they will not care about their boss or their duties .their kid are independent now so they will not worry about them .all these factors give old people time and chance to enjoy themselves and not anything else .the life experience and knowledge usually old people gained from their long enrollement in work , reading and dealing with people will surely offer them the capability to enjoy their time .they know most places which worths visiting .they know how to choose their friends and peers , and they can deal with any problem might face them .in addition to that old people might collect much more money than young did , so they can use their money in enjoyment .in conclusion , i believe that old people can enjoy their life much better than young people do , this is because old people have more time and money , got better experience , and lastly they are free from responsibilities which the younge people have .
