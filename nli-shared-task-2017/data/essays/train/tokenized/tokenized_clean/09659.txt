i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lern facts .in this essay , i would like to explain why i have this idea , with using examples of how i used to study in japan and how i am studying in the netherkands .in japan , i ve never had experiment in science class .what students do in the class is remembering the formulas that are given by teachers and prepare for tests .with this way of learning , students can remember a lot of formulas in short time .however , once they finish the test , they will forget what they remembered also within a short time .it is because , they do nt need the formula any more .whereas in the netherlands , we have severaal times of experiments in a week .students learn the process how the formula works so that they can understand ideas and concept of it .with this way of lerning , it takes quite long time to remember the formula , because students need time to do the experient to reach the formula .but , students do nt forget the formula so easily .this is because , students can remomber the formula as an ` experience  .i think i can remember formulas that i lern in dutch school after forty years , because it is my experience in the school .also , it is so stressful to learn only by remembering formulas , and taking tests .students will get bored with listening to a teacher and solving questions in a textbook .they ca nt concentrate during the class and the efficiency of stadying is low .on the other hand , it is fun to have experiments in the class .students can learn while they have fun .humans are tend to remember happy experience and forget unhappy experience .the efficiency of studying is hihg .to coclude , it is much more important to understand ideas and concept than learning fact due to its efficiency .students , who understand ideas and concept , will remember the studying forever .
