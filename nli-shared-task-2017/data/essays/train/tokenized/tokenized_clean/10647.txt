nowadays , young people are the busiest people among their communities .they are called as people who are promising and hopeful in the future .they are the one who can bring nnovations and have the ability to change the world more favorably .hence , we can not blame those young people being busy to work harder to keep up the steam .they do nt even have much time to helping their communities .for those young people , 24hours a day might be even a little short .is it really ruthless to not give enough time to helping their communities ?working harder and making effort continuously might be more beneficial later .they might bring a better world to live such as more comfortably and more favorably .this will cause the effect of happiness among many people .for instance , the world might turn into a very peaceful world with no wars nor struggles anymore so that there would be no more tragedy of separating families .nevertheless , on the one hand , young people should give enough time to helping thier communities first .every single work has to be done step by step .it would probably be better to start helping the communities rather than just concentrating on the future .if the communities do nt exist , there will be no more social lives in the world .the statement is quite true .in the 21st country , many people are very busy doing their own works or jobs .they hardly have time to helping out their communities .their role is not only helping their communities but also making a hopeful world .they have got lots of things to do and accomplish .however , they have to bear in mind that working for communities are not the thing of wasting time , it is worth it .
