youngsters are the very basis of a society .it is them who are energetic and capable enough to manage a nation and move it on the lines of development .it is them , who form the very backbone of a community .according to me , i dont think that it would be appropriate to blame all the youngsters for not helping their communities .well , we have every type of individual in every walk and every sphere of life and it would be inappropriate on our part to blame the complete lot of youngsters for a few irresponsible youth .the youngsters do actively participate in cultural , social as well as technological events in a community .for example ; as in my country india , economy boost is going on all because of efforts of the youngsters engaged in private sector management as well as technical tasks which is a help to the nation .then , we can also consider that many social activists are youngsters who take initiatives to wipe off the evils from the society .social refom projects are mainly running in collages and schools now-a-days .the youth of today is more aware of the right and wrong and at times , is even ready to teach their elders about it .also as we all know that the prominent literary artists , sports personell etc are the youth who , by their good work , bring name and fame to their community and society all across the world .although , i wont deny that certain youths do not participate at all in their community development , rather spoil their future by getting engaged in useless types of works or in antinational activities .or , such people would get addicted to drugs or so .in the end , i would like to conclude that youth now-a-days is pretty responsible and aware of its duties as a lot and should not be underrated or underjudged .i would say they are spending almost whole of their time for their community development .
