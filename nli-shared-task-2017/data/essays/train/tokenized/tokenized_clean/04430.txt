the issue of to be successful , whether people should try new things and take risks or do what they already know , is a controversial one .on the one hand , by doing what one knows well , the results of the actions are predictable and the methods are probably already proven .on the other hand , risk taking and tyring new things opens new and unexplored avenues to success which one could never have imagined .on final analysis , i belive trying new things and taking risks is more rewarding and brings about more success than doing what one already knows .successful people have always looked to the new ways to success , which were not necessarily the areas that they were experts in .these people venture into doing new things , learning a great deal in the processs , and then end up creating a new path to success .microsoft corporation is one such example of one such creation .created by a group of people , who belived in something new , in a time when the term ` software  was known only to a handful .today , that belief held by that group of people has given us a software that has changed the way our life functions .inventions and breakthroughs did not happen because of people who did what they did well .it happened because of people who moved out of their comfort zone , confroned norms , broke shakles , to prove a point .and have these people been successful ?most certainly so .right from albert einstein to micheal dell of dell computers .the argument in favor of doing what one does well is that one can predict the results , be assured of a short term success and then claim to be successful .but to achieve the next level of success , one needs to go further and foray into territories which are less trodden than others .
