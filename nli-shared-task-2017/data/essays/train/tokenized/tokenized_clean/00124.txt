if you can explain from each topic a few things it is good ; you have knowledge .however with your unfinished explanations you could confuse people even more .also in todays world there is a request in people who have specializations on one topic .in todays society it is better to have specialized your knowledge on on specific subject .having a little bit of knowledge in many topis is not so effecient in todays society as if people are specialist on specific topics .for example most people know something about computers .when the computer is broken they may try to fix it with their limited knowledge .this however may produce even more harm .it would be better to bring it to a specialist on computer who know what he or she is doing and fix it properly .another reason for beeing a specialist is when you try to find a job .most buisnesses looking for people with special abilities which are useful for their companies .so if you have a lot of knowledge in a specific subject which they need you are more likely to get that job .when you are a specialist you can use your knowledge to research on your specific topic and might find out something useful .for example the wright brothers knew a lot about flying .with help pf their knowledge they managed to built a plane which actually flew .and now look how far humanity got with the invention of the plane ; communitcation became so much easier .imagine what would happen if teachers would not specialize in a few subjects .students would properly never be able to learn in depth about the ideas represented in the `` scarlet letter  .nor will they be able to learn how electricty works .teachers specilize on they subject so they can answer all the questions one might have .it is very important to specialize you knowledge in one specific subject .with your knowledge you will be able to help people with problems including your specified topic .it is also easier to find a job since companies are looking out for peole with specializations .the power of knowledge can also be used to improve the living standarts by researching on planes or deseases .however you should never forget to know something about the other topics .if you do nt you will isolate yourself from the rest of world because you do nt understand what is happening .so be sure to kow a bit of everything and at the same time specialize in one specific subject .
