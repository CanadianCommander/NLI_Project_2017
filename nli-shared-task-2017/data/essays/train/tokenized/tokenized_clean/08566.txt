the issue at hand is whether broad knowledge on many subjects is bettar than specialization in one specific subject .the issue is important because specialization on a specific subject is a major aspect for students during thier graduation and higher studies .in my opinion to specialize on a particular subject is much better than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .firstly , if the student specializes on a specific subject , he will be focussed and concentrated in his field of study .trying to have knowledge of all academic studies might overburden the student and it might leave him in disarray and in a choatic condition .sometimes it may lead to serious consequences of getting very low grades .furthermore a subject will have lot of topics related to it .so a specializtion on such a topic will give an entire knowledge of that subject to the student .he is definetely going to master the entire subject .specialization on a particular topic will lead to research , as many thing are yet to be unravelled in this world .if the student pays specific attention to the specialization subject in case of higher studies like post graduation , he may face new problem in that subject and result in research related activities which is very good .take for example if no one tries to pay particuler attention on a specific field , there might have been no inventions and discoveries by the scientists .if einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physics , there would have been no development because all human creations of this date are based on his many thoeries like three laws of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physics etc .finally i want to conclude by supporting that specialization ona specific sunject is much better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .as the saying goes `` jack of all trades master of none  ; a student focussed on specific subject will be called a master of specific subject .so students should be advised right from their secondary schooling to pay particular attention on subjects they are intrested in and go for higher studies .
