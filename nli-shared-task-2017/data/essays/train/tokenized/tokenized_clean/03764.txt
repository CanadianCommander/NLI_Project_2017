have you never observed general behaviour of a group of people , let us say a school class ?if you have , you probably distinguished some particularly shy students , some other more quiet or polite .among these behaviours , you surely have been able to notest the most brave one , the one who did something that nodoby else did .this is the leader .the leader is , for instance , the student who have the courage to tell the professor about something inconvinient .if we bring this situation out of the school , we can say that the leader , the successful person , is the brave one .thi means that those persons who have never the courage to try something hard , different and new , have few possibilities to succeed .one reason for wich i believe that brave people are likely to be successful is that they normally love challenges , and challenges are opportunities to learn .a genuine curiosity also characterizes brave people often .curiosity means aquiring a wide knowledge , which a good starting point of a successful life .on the other hand , those who never pluck up the courage to measure themselves against challenging situations have few possibilities to enlarge their skills .moreover , such a behaviour reveals scarce curiosity and features people who are not willing to learn and improve themselves .the second reason is that successful people definitely need to be self confident , and brave people necessarly are .in fact , a successful life is often the result of many successful battles .in order to win all these , people must be confident in their abilities .i consider brave people to have this approach when they chase new challenges .in conlcusion , i definitely believe that a brave approach to challenges is required from those who want to be successful in their lives .brave people are not frighten of the events that may occur , and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situations .
