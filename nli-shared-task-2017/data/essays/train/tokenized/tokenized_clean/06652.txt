my point of view about this topic is clear and precise : i totally disagree with this statement .i am going to explain the reasons why i think young people generally give enough time to helping their communities .the best example i could explain is about myself .in fact , i am engaged in an association as a volunteer , the name of the association is worldwide known as `` emaeus  .the goal of this association is to provide help to poor people by providing to them the food they need , or in winter by collecting used clothes from generous families and give it to the poorest .here are two of the possibilities by witch you can work as a volunteer , but there are several others issues .my best friend for example graduated his business school on last year , so he has a diploma in finance and accounting major .thanks to those knowledges he has about accounting , he engaged himself for working 5 hours per week as account manager for the association emaeus , and as a volunteer of course .my friend and i do that because we want to fell usefull , and this provides a good personal satisfaction to help the ones who are in need .the second reason why i disagree whith that statement is because in the country i live in ( france ) , this enjoyement for helping communities is becoming more and more common .in schools or universities for example , we could find lots of advertizings for becoming engaged in associations , and this have more responses that attepted .people in france are very quiet about helping their commuunities .
