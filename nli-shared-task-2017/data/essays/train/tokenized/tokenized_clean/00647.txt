everybody will admit that a birthday celebration with young people is generally more cheerful , colorful and full of fun than a birthday with older people .same goes for a sports event , a concert and into many social activities .therefore , it could be said that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more means for that .these three means are eagerness , health conditions and new opportunities provided by technology .first , young people are eager to live .they are hungry for life .they could travel all over the world , try new sports and meet new people .they have not consumed the joys of life .they are not prudent and ready to take risks which hopefully increases enjoyment .however , older people are generally static both in mind and pysically .they have rules set for their life .there are nothing much left for them to discover .discovery itself is a big enjoy and young people could easily discover .second , young people s health conditions provide them that joy .when they got home from school or work , they do not feel any aches like the elderly do .even they drink a lot on the previous night , they find the stamina to get up and continue their life , whereas older people suffer from countless sickness even in their normal days .poor health conditions , which most of the older people have , is a great barrier to enjoy life .thirdly , for every new young generation , there are more opportunities to enjoy life than the older generations since there have been a lot improvements in communication technology and transport .fourty years ago it was almost impossible for an american girl to meet with an indonesian boy .with the improvements in computer technology , a lot people have a lot of friends in different continents whom they shared their feelings , expectations and so on .therefore , their taste for life increases .they could also easily to travel in order to meet these people face to face .there are much more planes travelling all around the world .no one could argue that finding and getting together with the people you understand each other isin conclusion , even though there are exceptional older people who could enjoy life , i agree with the idea that young people have more opportunities to enjoy and they certainly do .
