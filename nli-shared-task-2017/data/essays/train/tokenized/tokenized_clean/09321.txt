i agree that young people do not give time to help their communities .recently , the world became very busy and the society changed drastically compared to 50 years ago .there are two main reasons which prevent young people from helping their communities .first of all , young people become very busy , they can not spend enough time in their community .for example , nowadays , young people go to not only school for studying but also private schools .around 75 % of junuior high school and high school students in tokyo , japan go to private school twice a week till night .in this situation , it is very difficult for students and young people to spare the time in their community .moreover , young people s life has been changed .they play with their friends in the city not only in their community .the city has been developed , and there are many entertainments , such as movies , internet cafes , and shopping buildings .this attracts young people so much and lets them spend most of thier free time in the city .thus young people never come back to their communicty .second of all , the community itself has been changed .nobody in the community does not care local activities any more .50 years ago , there were alot of local events and meetings in the community in even tokyo area .one of the reason of this is alot of people are moving in and out in tokyo because of their study and work , and people do not settle down .thus nobody will take care of local activities .on the otherhand , young people in the suburb tend to move out to big cities for study and work and come back several years later , and naturally , they can not join or help their communities .as a conclusion , i support that young people thesedays do nt give enough time to help their communities because of luck of time and change of community .
