i agree and in the same time i disagree with this statement .it defers frome each side point of view .let us supposed i m a young guy i will agree .because young people can play alot of sports like football , basketball , swimming , gouging , and body bilding , but eldary people can nt .also thay can do dangirus sports like bongy jumbing .and can travel for along time with out taking medisin like eldary ones .however young people can gather with friend at late time enjoying them selfs and can sleep late unlike eldary people .and if we look at it from old people view thay will say we can arrange our time and play sports like table tennes , cheese , monopoly and we can enjoy our time by watching t.v. vissiting friends .they do nt need phisical motion to enjoy life .finaly am with youn
