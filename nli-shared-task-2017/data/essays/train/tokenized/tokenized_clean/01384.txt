i agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .people always try new things in oneway or the other to make their life more affordable or happier .when a person tries in developing something that would make life of society , he will succed in doing so because he have invested considerable amount of time and risk .once succeded , he looks for new things that are pausable for many people .he takes this as a spirit or challenge .he brainstrom ideas , put to experiment and take the risks .it is a desire to try newthings with risk for the people who were successful in the past .it makes them fell happier and drive forward .i would give some personal examples to strongly support my above statement .for instance , when i was working on reasearch project at a pharmaceutical company back in my early childhood , i developed a drug for cancer that helped cure many people .i took the risk in developing the drug knowing the consequences that will have my life .this successful incident led me to try new things .development of instrument that revolutionized the lives of people who have diabetes ( people who can not regulate bood sugar ) .this happened when i was with pfizer in early 1984 .at times there is no way people can analyse their blood sugar level without going to hospitals .it was really very hard on me to develop and instrument that would one day help everyone to get their blood glucose results instantaneously .i had spent considerable amount of time on this project .if i am right , it took me 10 years to develop this instrument .i felt it is like taking the risk , because i may succed at the end or may be not .i was very successful in doing so .finally , i would appreciate the people who are successful and try new things , eventhough knowing the risks in doing so .
