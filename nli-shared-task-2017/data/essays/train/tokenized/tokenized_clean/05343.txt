with regards to the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ., i totaly agree with it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .the first reason is that students can hold theories and applied sciences much longer this way than learning only facts .the second reason is that students are able to link different subjects at the university , and therefore they can understand much more things in the different subjects .i am studiying at the university in cologne and i have friends , who believes in the same statement like me .i often ask my proffesor at the end of the lecture , when i couldnt understand a lot of things in the ideas and concepts , which he or she has presented us .the reason why i do this , is to capture all the things to understand the idea and concepts .otherwise i cant understand the whole lecture , whe i onlz get the facts , e.g numbers or dates .i also would forget most of the facts , when i only get the facts without learning the ideas and the concepts .the second reason is that students are able to link different subjects at the university .it is very important to understand the ideas and the concepts to link theories in the different subjcts as a whole .when i understand the concepts and the ideas , i am able to link the subjects to each other in many cases .i am quite sure that i will do the same until the end of my study .i hope that my collegue will also follow me the above outlined reasons are why i always agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
