cars are one of the most important way of transportation and they are part of our daily life .everyone knows someone who owns a car , or owns one himself .a lot of teenegers buy a car as soon as they turn 18 , that is why i belive that it will be hard to reduce the amount of cars that are in use today .i actually belive that the amount of cars will increase .on the other hand , there are optional ways of traveling such as train , bus , metro . ..this type of transportation , public transportation , might be used by people who do nt have enough money to buy a car .but nowadays there are a lot of sales on car selling and it is fairly easy to be able to own one .cars are very confortable , you can relax , sit down , listen to music and you can travel with the people you wish to travel with .they give us freedom : you decide when you leave a place and go home , you do nt have go be waiting in the bus stop when it s cold in winter .people might thing that cars will not be used in the future because of the gas ; it is expensive and it is expiring .i belive that as time goes by , experts will find other sources that will replace the gas .20 years is a short poeriod of time for society to change so much , maybe in 200 years .right now cars are so into our lives that it will be very difficult to replace them .
