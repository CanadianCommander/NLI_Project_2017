i agreed that young people do not give enough time to help in any communities which they find themself or belong .young people of nowadays are so much occupied with alot of activities .young people spend alot of thier time in doing irrelevant things such spending alot of time on the internet , playing computer games and other activities .young people of nowadays believed that this is world in which everybody has to minds his or her own business so there is no importance in focusing in ths issue of another person .they belived that helping communities is an old people work because they have alot of goals to achieve in there life time so maybe when they get old someday they could help their community .young people also belived that they needed money to help thier community becauce they they do not have enough fund to contribute to the project lay down by the commuinity so they tend to step back .i can also state some student do not have time to help the community because they do not have necessary time to do that .imagine an undergraduate student who is enroll as full time student , after the classes , he has to study perhaps need to do extra jobs to assist himself financially .yong people of nowaday believe that community has nothing to offer them while should they spend thier time helping the community instead they prefer to go to night club and have fun with their friends .most of the younth are ignorance of the word , contribution to the community , they do not have the necessary informations on what is meant by helping thier communities .in conclusion i will note that young people of nowadays are not giving enough time to help thir communities base on the points made above .
