trying new things have many advantages but it has also lots of negative effects .i disagree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because of the reasons that it is wasting time , often dangerous .even though people can gain new experiences through trying new experiences , it is wasting time .keep working on something they already know how to do well is the way to be successful and saving time .if people try new things , they always start and learn all things over again and again .nevertheless , they can discover and get to know more deeply if they keep doing what they are familiar about .for example , me and my friend started to play flute when we were in third grade .i am still learning it but my friend decided to play another instrument next year .now , she forgot how to play flute at all and she wants to play it again .then she have to go over it all again and forget about the one that she was learning before .thus , trying new things is wasting time .it always can be dangerous to try new things .because they do nt really know and not skilled about it .about 3 years ago , i decide to learn snow bording since i only know how to ride ski .i thought that ski and snow bording would be similar but it was nt .i was really confident before i fell down several times and hurt myself so badly .in addition , people can fall into things negatively like addicting because at first , they are not sure what it is and just start it .therefore , trying new things can give risks .i would rather keep improving things i am good and skilled at than trying a variety of experiences because it is wasting time and could harm myself .safe is always first .doing what they already know how to do well is the way to be successful .
