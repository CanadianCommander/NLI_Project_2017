the topic issue is that they will be fewer cars to use in next twenty years .this issue is important because in todays time it does show where the world will reach if it continues like this .i agree with the fact that in next twenty years there will be fewer cars on road .firstly it could be true because of the traffic on road .in today s world the traffic is so much that we can not accomodate the number of cars we are having talkless of the number in next twenty years .so i believe in next twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .secondly could be that people driving get frustated .many people now-a-days are already complaining about how frustated they are when they are outside on the road .they have to face a lot of stress in order to reach their destination .so i think they will opt out and not buy cars and rather use the public transportation provided for them by the government .so that states that there will be fewer cars in use in next twenty years .lastly it may be because of the government .the government may ban the use of many cars and put a check on the number of cars being imported or produced in the country because of the noise and air pollution it creates in the environment .so finally the reason brings us to the fact that in next twenty years there will be fewer cars .in conclusion i would want to state that i agree that there will be fewer cars in use in next twenty years because of the several points stated above .ultimately i want to end by saying that it will be better for all of us if it actually happens .that will improve a lot in a persons life , thats less stress and the impact on the environment will also be reduced too .
