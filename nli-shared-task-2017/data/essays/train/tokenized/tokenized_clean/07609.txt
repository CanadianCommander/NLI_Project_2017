well i agree with the statement .young poople do actually enjoy life more than older people .its important here to define what one mean by `` enjoyment  .if one means that enjoyment means having your dream car , more money to spend , going to late naight parties and clubs , then yes youths are indeed at an advantage because they have the youthfull energy and charisma and are not prone to health problems as older people are usually prone to .but if one defines enjoyment as having peace of mind , relaxation and trouble free life then there cant be happier retired person whose son stays with him and who has all the time in the world to play with his 1 yr old grandson .young people have the advantage of flexibility .they can adapt to a new situation more easily than old people who usually become reserved with age .if you have to shift from one city to another , as a youth you will be able to adjust very easily to the new city and start enjoying your life but as an oldie you wont be able to come to the terms of the new city and make new friends easily .the most important factor is of health .old age often brings many diseases along with it .and as one grow old he s bound to have one or the another disease .this health factor also contributes a lot to the fact that older people dont enjoy much because even if they are youthful at heart , they cant be physically because their health wont permit .science and technology have become internal parts of our life .every day there are new gadgets to be found in the nearby store and very quickly they make way into our homes .internet has shrinked the world but the its the youth that are making the most use of it .todays youth is more technically inclined and he knows how to make the best use of the technolgy that is being discovered and enjoys it to its fullest .the problem with older people is that they are not that much technically inclined and as a consequence are not inclined towards such gadgets which would make there life more enjoyable .
