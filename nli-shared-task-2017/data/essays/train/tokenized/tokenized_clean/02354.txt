in general , i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .however i would maybe change this statement into : young people nowadays are not given enough time to helping their communities .i think that today many people , particularly young people , just do not have the time to care about their communities .they are involved into too many other activities .the pressure from school for example and all the other possibilities and offers provided by advertisment do distract them from any social activities or projects .another reason why i approve of this statement is that i think young people do not really have too many possibilities to get involved into any social project .the communities do actually rather care about current problems with policy and administration , so that even they are not really able to spend too much time on thinking about involving youngsters .the only opportunity for helping the communities , which is taken by most young men , is doning the civil service or going to the military after finishing school .but even this opportunity is actually not taken voluntarily but one is actually forced by government to do any of these two services .of course if young people would be more interested in helping their communities they could maybe gain some access to some helping organzations .but as long as this interest does not exist and as long as the communities do not offer any urgent projects to them , communities wont get any more help from young people .most young people do care about their families and friends very much .and if anybody has a problem most young people are willing to help .consequently you see that there is not a lack of common interest but there is just a lack of connection between young people and communities .
