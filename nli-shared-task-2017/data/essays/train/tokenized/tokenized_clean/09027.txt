although i do believe , that lots of people still invest energy and time for their communities , i tend to agree with the statement .as a matter of fact , even i do not invest time in working voluntarily for the well-being of others around me and when i reflect about the activities of my friends and family , i see no difference to me .to understand why , one should see the bigger picture .in times people more and more suffer from economic pressure , in times they have to focus on two , or even three jobs to bring home money for their family members , it is a logic consequence , that they do not have additional time to take care of others .a good example for this phenomenon is the life style of a univeritz collegue .in order to being able to afford his studies ( which means : entry fees , course fees , books , ... ) , he is forced to work very hard besides univerity .it s just impossible for him to additionally work voluntarily .and there are lots of cases like him .but it s probably not just a matter of possibility , but of will .people tend to be very focused on their own lifes , their own progression , their careers .in order to achieve respect ( which in our society is very much associated with material success ) , one has to be very focused one himself or herself .`` if you want to achieve something professionally , you shouldn waste time  , this is more and more common sense .and although i believe , that many positive , rather abstract advances arise when helping others voluntarily , i do not believe , that these advances are well recognised in our society .and as individuality is more and more a maxime at least where i live , it is a logical consequence , that people do not care so much for each other anymore .
