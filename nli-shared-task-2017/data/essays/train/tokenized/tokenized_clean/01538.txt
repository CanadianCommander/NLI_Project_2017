it is well known that education is a tricky issue .it raises a lot of questions and everybody does not agree on it .indeed , educational differences between countries is a telling example of those questions .specialization is prefered in some countries and others adopt a general educational pattern .from my point of view , a general broad knowledge is better than to spezialize in only one subject .i support the idea that with a real general knowledge you develop your ability to have a general view of the world .a case of point to highlight is that , yet among ancient greek philosophers a general knowledge was the condition of the achievement of the truth .that is a general statement in which i believe .second , this ancient belief of general knowledge has gone across centuries .i am convinced that it is still true .for instance , in my school , i am studying sunstainable development .although some good actions are done without this general view , it is not enough .you have to consider all the parts of an issue before acting .if you try to develop fair trade , be sure that transports will not be to harmfull for the environment .finally , from my point of view you can specialize after having received a general education .it is the french educational policy .children must go at school and learn various subjects before specialize at college .in my opinion it makes children more likely to become good citizens , they have some knowledge in many subjects .for instance to vote , they are more aware of main issues .by way of conclusion , i would say that even though specialization is important and allows people to reach an accurate knowledge in one subject , a general view provided by a general knowledge is the way to avoid some big slides .
