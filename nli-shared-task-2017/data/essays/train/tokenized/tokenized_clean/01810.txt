have you ever thought about the advertisements on tv , magazines , or newspapers ?are they really showing the real value of the products ?this discussion is still talking among people and scientists .there are many companies producing new products .so , they have to sell these products in some ways .one of the most effective way is advertisements .how do the advertisements show this products to us ?according to me , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two reasons for this : the companies can not spend much more money for their products than they spend now , and there is no good reason to trust advertisements .first of all , the companies are playing an important role in this schene .why ?because they are producing lots of products .when they are making these products , they have to be careful about the prices and quality .these two things are very opposite .if you want to make a good product , you should spend money for this , or you can just spend little money for your product , but it can not be a good production .if you became a manager or owner of a factory , which would you prefer ?companies in this sector are producing their products with cheap costs .so , the products are not really qualify .after that , they will sell these products , but how ?advertisement is a good answer to this question .they will you tv , magazine , or newspaper for their products .in this time , advertisements show these products seem much better than they really are and people are buying these products .in business life , the important thing is to earn lots of money from their produts by using advertisements .so , these advertisements are very useful for selling them .the second thing is that there is no good reason to trust advertisements .for example , on the magazines or newspapers there are some products to become thinner and they are giving a chance to have a good body shape for people .in the advertisements , there are some effective pictures in order to sell these products , but how can we trust these products ?there is no good reason and also these medicines or products can be very dangerous for our body .maybe we can die because of these products .if you want to have a good body shape , you should go to doctors and take some advises from them .you sholud nt believe these advertisements if you want to be healthy .consequently , there are lots of advertisements on media and they are introducing many products .we shouldt forget that these advertisements are making products seem much better than they really are .
