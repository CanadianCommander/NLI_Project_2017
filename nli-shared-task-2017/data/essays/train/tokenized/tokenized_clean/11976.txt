people all over the world often discuss , wheather young peoole spend enough time helping the communities .i think that lots of young people are concernd about community and also hlep them a lot .first of all i think this already starts in school .in every class the pupils elect one of them to be a speaker for the hole class .you have also pupils doing that for the complete school .so they learn early about being reposable for class mates and training their social skills , which is very useful for being a person who helps others and so the communities .but i also think that you can help community if you get yourself a good education .because you might help better , if you have a huge knowlege in managing thinks or organisation .so i a high education standard is a big help for comunity , if the people have better jobs they will be more likely to hlep than an unemployed person who thinks that it is the communities fault that he has no job .moreover ther are lots of young people envolved in different organisations .they help in sport clubs for example , by organize trainig sessions or they help planning activities for the members like campings or visiting pools or cities .so they help to avoid that smaller children spend to much time by their own .morover i think young people also help community by doing their civil work .after finishing school the male persons will be able to do social work instead of going to the army .so lots of jobs could not be paid to be done by professional trained employers so this people help that this work is done .lots of young people also participate in organisations as first aid or the free fireworks .so they help in their free time rescueing other people , which i think is very veluable to communities .all in all i think there are lots of young people who care about and help communitiy , but there are also some who do not care , which is often see by more people so that they think all young people are that way .
