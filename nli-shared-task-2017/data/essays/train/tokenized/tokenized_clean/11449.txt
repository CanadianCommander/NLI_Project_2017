i totally disagree with the statement saying that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .i think that there will be even more cars in the future , e.g. because of the economical progress and growing wealth in some strongly populated countries like china or india .the more money the people in these countries earn , the more comfort they will like to have .and cars are one of the most significant symbols of comfort and status in our life .so the new rich and middle class people of china and india will try to achieve this certain level of comfort and status by buying huge amounts of cars , meanwhile the demand for cars in relatively wealthy and developed regions like europe or northern america will stagnate at it s current level .as a conclusion one can say that it will be the developing countries that will rise the demand and the number of cars in the world by their growing wealth and the wishes of their inhabitants for more comfort .another argument to prove my thesis is the globalization and enlarging infrastructure worldwide .it s quite common to say that our world becomes smaller nowadays .the reason for such thoughts is the rapidly growing infrastructure , which makes it easier for many people to travel around or to send goods to foreign countries .in our globalized world , you need to get from one place to another in a short time , e.g. to lead a succesful business .and for moving around , you need streets and cars .therefore , the more our world becomes globalized and connected , the more streets and cars will be built .one aspect , that can influence the production and use of cars in a negative way , could be the growing price for natural gas and petrol .but i m sure that scientists will be successful in their aims to create cars which do not depend anymore on gas or petrol supplies .in my opinion , in twenty years there will be much more cars that are propelled with alternative or natural ressources such as electricity or ethanol made out of plants .that s why i peronally do nt expect the high prices for oil and gas to have some serious effects on the number of cars .
