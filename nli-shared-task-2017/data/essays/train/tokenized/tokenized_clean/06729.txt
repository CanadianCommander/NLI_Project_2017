`` only people who venture into the sea get the pearl  .so goes an ancient indian proverb .and how true ?i completely agree with the statement that success comes to those who take risks and do nt merely rest on past laurels .i will present some explanations and examples to support my strong opinion about the issue .if we stop and think about what will happen if all of us continue to do only the things we are sure of , or things we are best at ?i shudder to think of such an eventuality .the whole world would come to a grinding halt .the world needs innovation and hunger in people to try on new things .and the people who do that can be called the drivers of the world .they are the leaders in the true sense .for example had gallileo not taken a stand about the earcth being round , had columbus not made that discovery that changed the world order .what would the world be like ?the constant need of change and trying on newer and better things may be risky but is certainly worthwhile .also in this fast changing world , if people however successful , stop trying new things and taking risks , they will soon find themselves not successful .businesses , scientists and governments , in other words all the people need to take risks just to survive .you can keep on doing what you do best ; but in time you will realise that the thing you do no longer is good enough because the times have changed .moreover none of the inventions and discoveries were made without taking risk .currently popular management and business procedures were a risk when they were implemented for the first time .we have only the people to thank who were brave enough to take up the challenge .we need more such people if we continue our growth in almost any field .another important fact about risks and new things is the novelty value and the motivational effect .new things and risks challenge people which is fodder for most successful people .they crave for that challenge - they are challenged to out do themselves and this keeps the successful people going on .here goes a common joke on bill gates .`` bill gates dropped out of school to create the microsoft empire .i can bet my last dollar on `` had he continued in school , he would still be working in microsoft - just owned by someone else  .this aptly concludes that success comes to those who are not averse to taking risks and constantly try newer things .
