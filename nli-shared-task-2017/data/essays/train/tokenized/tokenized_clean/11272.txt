a hundred years ago nobody thought that these days we would have millions and millions of cars in use in every country .i do nt think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .in fact , i do belive that the number of cars in use will increase dramatically .one fact that may cause this is that there will be more single people than nowadays , and they will all need a way of transportation from home to their place of work .another reason why numer of cars will increase is that rich people love cars .they think they are better persons if they have more cars than anyone .that s why they will keep on buying them and using all of them to try to show how rich , powerful and great persons they are .in addition , cars are may be the best way to get from one place to another : it is the cheapest way to travel , and you are free to decide where you want to go , even to change your opinion during the travel .but cars do represent a big problem to our environment .they produce toxic gases that affects the ozone layer .due to these gases our lungs are polluted too .now there are more people with cancer than back then .in the future , cars will face another problem : the matter that there will not be enough oil to all of them .is there anything that we can do to protect ourselves and our environment from pollution and also still have the chance to travel whenever we want , wherever we want , anytime we want ?yes , there ir .but the solution , unfortunately , has not been developed yet .we need new ways of transport , such as vehicles that runs thanks to electricity instead of oil .that s why i really believe that when these ` green vehicles  get to be developed , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , it wo nt happen in twenty years .
