ideas and facts are really different things .ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt .because it is an only idea .but fact is different .facts must be done in real life .i think it is iportant to learn facts than ideas .because facts are real but ideas are not .you can learn somuch ideas about something but you ca nt apply these ideas in real life .it is not important if you do nt apply ideas in real life .but if you know facts you can apply immediately when you hear ideas .but if you know only ideas you cant do anything in real life .for example an electronic engineer can know how television works .but he/she knows only idea that how it works .i think this not important .in real life people dont pay attention ideas .people pay attetion facts .because fact are real and applicable .people want to see something .people dont want hear only ideas .if they see facts then people pay attention ideas .and say `` ooo it is a good idea , congratulations  .it is waste of time to learn ideas .if you learn fact you also learn ideas background of this fact .if we learn only ideas we must spend time to learn facts about this idea .but we learn facts directly we also learn the ideas .so we dont lose time .facts is general .so when you learn facts about something , you also learn ideas about this .
