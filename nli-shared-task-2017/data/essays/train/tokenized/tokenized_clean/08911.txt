advertisement has become one of the most important business in today s society .media are always keen on giving details about the budget this or that company has spent on ads , wether in the newspaper , on television , on radios .now , the question is : are most advertisements making products seem much better than they really are ?in other words , are most advertisements misleading up to the point that we , as consumers , are fooled about the actual quality of the product ?this question can not be answered in a rationnal , or scientifical manner , for the simple reason that all products would need to be tested by a panel in order to evaluate the discrepency between the conception of the product brought by the advertisement and the perceived quality .nonetheless , we can try to point out some ideas based on examples .the purpose of an advertisement is to make people buy the product .this trivial statement implies another triviality : the message used in the advertisement has to be emphatic , it has to praize the qualities of the products and highlights the characteristics that make it different from its concurrents .most washing powders have no choice but to state they can wash the nastiest kind of stains you could ever find on your shirt .this is a classical example of misleading advertisement , and we all have experienced the stain that is not removed by the magic powder we saw on televison .most advertisement praizing an technical breakthrough should be considered precauciously .now with the development of new technologies , and with the dramatic changes the world has witnessed in the past centuries , there are two main points to be made in order to nuance this too affirmative statement .considerable progress has been made in the field of advertising .now , some ads do not even show the product they are selling .some others use humour .by using different means of delivering the message , these ads are more likely to touch their target , and they could not even be accused of being misleading , because you were not shown the product , or not in its normal usage .it would be an advertisement for a car which is shown 2 seconds at the end .for example .finally , the sensibility of the consumer can not be excluded from the evaluation of the advertisement .what can seem to be emphatic to some , can look boring to others .show a group of monkeys to sell a washing powder , the consumer s response might vary to great extents .this is an actual add .advertisement will remain , one should evaluate it with its one feelings .
