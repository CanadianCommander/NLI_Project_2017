in wealthy regions of the world , it is common that a typical family has more than a car per person .sometimes , especially when i am stuck in the traffic , i wonder if this situation will ever change .i strongly believe that in twenty years the number of cars will decrease deeply .and there are mainly two reasons that convice me contending that .firstly , enviromental protection is becoming a topic of paramount importance in governments policies .many people s health has already been negatively impacted by the polluting effects of a too heavy circulation .therefore people are a lot more concerned in the prevention and limitation of this problem .public transportation is generally considered to be the most effective solution and car users seem more and more willing to take advantage of it .then , it is evident that having a car ( or more than one ) means wasting a large amount of money .it is part of our daily routine reading that oil price has increased once again during the night .not to mention the huge insurance costs and the several and varous types of fees related to the use of a car .last but not least , it has to be taken in account that many municipalities , in order to reduce traffic in the city centers , usually come out with special permits to park in certain areas .such permits are generally perceived extremely expensive by the the majority of the population .in conclusion , enviromental protection and incresing costs should convince all of us that a more limited use of cars would be a better solution for everyone .of course , also governments and educational systems should help , and it appears that they are on the way to sensibilize people to that effect .these are the reasons why i am positive that in twenty years it will not happen to me to be stuck in traffic as often as it occurs to me now .
