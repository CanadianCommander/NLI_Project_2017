i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are a several reasons to support my opinnion .firstly , in twenty years some of the developing countries will become economically stable .when that happens , a number of citizens in that country will be able to buy new cars .for example , china is one of the countries .now , it is becoming a economically enormous country and a lot of people are now purchasing new cars .secondly , in a lot of western countries like america or canada , except for large cities its almost impossible to transport without cars .people can not even go to school without cars .of course small countries like japan have a very nice subway and bus system , but not all countries are like that .it also costs a lot of money to make that system and its not top priority in the countries to do this so i think the use of cars will not change or even increase .thirdly , according to the development in science , the prices of cars will go down .therefore , the people who could not afford to have cars will be able to buy one and it will be easy for people to buy second , third , or even fourth cars in the family .these days in developed nations , there are concerns about the fact that using cars effect the global warming , and instead of everybody using cars , public transportation is being considered .however , there has been a lot of research on cars that prevent pollutions .toyota s `` prius  is an example .in conclusion , i think that there will be more cars in use than there are today .
