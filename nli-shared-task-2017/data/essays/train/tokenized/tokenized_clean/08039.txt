this issue of whether successful people would like to try new things and take risk or only to do what they already know how to do well is meaningful but contentious since different people could hold vastly diverse views because of their respective backgrounds .on the one hand , some might insist that doing what people have learned is more important ; on the other hand , others might claim that learning to try new ideas and thoughts is more crucial .although the former advice ahs some values , i vote the latter one .in the following discussion , i employ three lines of reasoning to support my position .first of all , the main idea that could be presented to develop my position is that learning to try new things could advance one s thinking .obviously , we easily can find a common case that some experts say that trying to think more new things and ideas greatly helps people to improve their ways of critical thinking .in this case , it is quite marked that both actual experience and common sense could inform us of the notion that the applicability of this idea would be highly agreeable among people .second , another point that i select to stress some concers is that learning to try new things means a positive attitude toward the life s challenges .for example , a csae that could use to justify my opinion is that all successful business people always want to try the new ideas to create their own businesses and to solve the major problems that they face .thus , this point should be well applied to other conditions , thereby forming a creditable standard for assessment of one s ability .finally , on no account can we ignore the important factor that learning to try new things stands for one s ability to handle different difficulities before we make an overall summary .it is universally believed that this prospective might be regarded as nothing but an obscure idea in the current would .however , a case that could prove the imprtance and the influence of this factor is that there are more and more unpredictable situations that could only be sloved by those who would like to break up the old mode and to try to create the new one .when the pros and cons of each choice are all well checked and comprehensively evaluated , the most striking conclusion would be well-reasoned and well-founded .to sum up , given the reasons and examples discussed above which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus becme more persuasive , we could conclude that only kowing how to learn new things from trying to do them could lead a person to become successful in the current business world .
