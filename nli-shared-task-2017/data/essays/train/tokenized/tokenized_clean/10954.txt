i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .success usually comes to people who wok with determination and dedication to achieve their goals .they work in all directions to achieve their goal .for example , a fashion designer would earn more fame for her or his innovative ideas rather than retaining the old ideas .they need to try newer things in order to pace up with the every day fashion , or they are termed as out dated .in buisness too , a person reaches a pinnacle only when he uses newer techniques to promote his project .he needs to take risks to develop or expand his buisness empire rather than sticking to old ideas in this 21st century .a computer software engineer should try something innovative and interesting depending on his capability to achieve heights in his career rather than just doing a job .on the other hand it is always not necessary that a person who tries newer things are succeessfull .for example , a doctor should not try newer things or take risk on patients life , they should rather do what they already have been practising .practise makes a man perfect .a highly experienced doctor is more succeessful than a less experienced doctor .he can heal a patient or cure him with his experience which teaches him as how to deal with the his illness , what appropriate antibiotics or what apt surgery should be performed .so succeess conquer people who try new innovative ideas , work with dedication and determination ..
