sometimes we can see the article from newspaper , in which the successful company or person is introduced .they always develop their company or themselves through finding new items or new traits .moreover , we know they take risks whenever they try to new things .so i agree , successful people or company try new things and take risks rather than doing just one item .at first , i would like introduce my professor .she was originally a high school english teacher .in my country , korea , the teacher is the best job to women .it gurantees good salary and reputition .furthermonre , the teacher can take a rest for a vacation and get many education program about music , exercise , because these fields are necessary for the teacher to teach their students in many ways .but she decided to be a professor .as many people know , people who want to be a professor require a doctor degree in univ. and it takes about 5 or 6 years to finish .anyway she determined to study abroad and to be a professor even though she could nt take care of her children in korea .i think it would the hard decision to her .but she finish whole course perfectly , and then she became the professor .i think she is successful person because she succeeded her dream thanks to trying new things .the samsung , an international company , is another example .samsung was a small company until some decades .at that time , samsung had only few items that it can afford .but the chief always looked around to search what makes his company bigger .he representatively found the field of a cell phone .and he start to study that part even though he had many risks .eventually , he succeed and made his company a international one .these two shows us how important trying new things and taking risks .i think unless they started someting under the unstable situation and conducted what they thought , these successes were impossible .in conclusion , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
