base on my own experience i totally agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .now i will give you my conspicious reasons .first idea comes in to my mind is the definition of successful , that is outstanding which has the same meaning of standing out .it is to say those successful people should be different from ordinary people .how to be different ?the answer definitly not only doing what others already know how to do well .it is reasonable that the awards usually go to those who try new thinks and take risks because they are outstanding .second try new things and take risks can make people more open minded and gain more knowledge and finally make them successful .when try new things you can get another point of view of the problem .i can remember that my senior design project was to design a control system for hot blast stoves .pervious people solve this kind of problem by classical control methods , however my teammember and i decided to try intellengence method although our advisor warned us that we might fail .guess the result , we not only acheived our project successfully , but also got undergraduate research prize .reading the history books you may find that each huge development of the world has some relationship with the new inventions .and more and more schools teach students the invent ability is the most important quality to become successful nowadays .look at another side of the statement and suppose that if people only repeated doing what they already know how to do well .no new theories , no new technoledge , no new applications , how could the world get increasing development .from all the points i mentioned above we can drive a conclusion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
