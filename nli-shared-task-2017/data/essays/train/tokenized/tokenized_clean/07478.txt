i am agree , but ! ...if we have to be very optimistics , because you never knows what is gona happen with the wars and the growing of the radicalism in the world .also we have to take a look to the audience who can demand this kind of product .everything , is so complex if we see the petrol market , thousands , of people , are die every month directly or not directly because this problem , so . ..of course the first world is asking for the development of new industries in this field of the consume ( cars ) and this also , demand a lot of petrol and a lot of social politics inside the problem .is a delicated tool to use from eeuu against the arabian world to impose his power to take the fuel for the cars , because directly or indirectly all the industries of the cars ( even if exist in japan ) have something made in america .in my opinion , ...could be too long to explain my real idea about that . ..i mean , last week i passed my driving permission , now i am crazy about drive , i would like to buy a cheap car to carry my double-bass with me , to go to the gigs without the help of anybody . ..but in twenty years , may be i would like to go by bus and train because the stress and polution , i thing that if we are still alive in this time , the politic about the public transport have to change , at least in spain .if we compare this kind of things with the countries of the north of europe , like holland we are very far . .there , the public transports are much more eficience .also , for the people is cheaper , there are much more trams , and trains ( wich is more ecologic ) and they have more buses in the stations .so i am agree because , if we do nt have a social revolution before , finally , we are gona be more `` europeans  , and more civilizated , but we are gona lost humanity anyway . ..
