in this era , where it is possible to underline an increase of the production , most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are .this is a result of a great number of products that the owner of the companies has to sell to the consumers .for this reason i agree with that statement .i think that , in this period , everyone who have to sell anythinks wants to show it in a better way than it really is .is possible to find a products that have a very low price but at the same time it is problably not a very good items .now where internet has increase its importance in selling products , all the people try to show them in a fantastic state with a beautifull pictures and one very accurate description .for example one year ago i bought a support for mobile phone for the car .when it arrived at home i observed it and i noted that was not well as in the computer .the material that it was made was very very bad and an optional item , that i bought with the support , did nt arrive at home .it  s possible to find a lot of advertisements on television that show all the items in a very beautifull way and i think that anyone have to pay attention before buying a particular products .i thinks is better to buy an items of a brand that is known .in this way you are sure to buy a good item event if its price could be expensive .the most important brands have a great experiece in working and they use all kind of machines or material they need .in this capitalistic era infact there are many people that open an industry to selling a products .to have a very low costs they use a material that is not good .this is occurred for example in cina where the prices of the products are very cheap .i had a lot of experiences in buying a product that are not good as they are showed , for this reason i suggest to buy a very famous product !!
