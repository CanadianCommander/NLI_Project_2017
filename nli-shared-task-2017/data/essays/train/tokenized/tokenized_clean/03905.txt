to answer this question i will first give you some ideas from the business area , as i think that this is the ideal environment to prove that successful people try new things and take a lot of risks .as you can see on daily news , a lot of people invented successful new products for example like the google founders .but these people also had a high risk in not succeeding .so , i think that you can only have a lot success if you try new things and take all the risks this might include .one reason why i believe this is , because consumers are all looking for new not already existing things .they want to be more and more unique and seen as individuals so you should not copy an already existing product but create a real new one .if you take the tamagotchi as an example , the developer had some producing costs , but he took this risk and was successful , because he developed a completely new product which people looked for .therefore , by trying out somenthing new he was really successful and generated a high return on investment in his new idea .furthermore , i think that by trying out something new you will learn a lot about how things work .of course you will make mistakes , but you will not do them again if they occur the next time .for example , if you take a baby that has touched a hot oven , you can be sure it will never touch it again , because it has experienced the negative effect of burning his or her hand .finally , your life will be more interesting if you always try something new instead of doing all things in the same boring way .you might gain a lot more life experience and you will develop into a real interesting person .for example , on parties you can always talk about the things you just did and you will be respected by the other people for the courage that you demonstrated and therefore , you will be considered as a successful person .in conclusion , these are the main reasons why i think that successful people try new things and take risks is the better option .
