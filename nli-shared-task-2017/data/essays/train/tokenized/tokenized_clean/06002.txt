some people think that it is more important for students to understand idea and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , while others think the against thing of the first kind of people .i think i am a person who disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and i disagree with statement for many reasons .first of all , i think that is very important for student who they are do nt have much information in their life and they do nt have much experience in their life so in this way it is more important to learn facts than understand ideas and concepept because with the learing facts which in formation they will need it in the future life to build strong family , and also the will get useful or they will benefit from this facts which they learned it , in this way the will have alot of backround of different information , for example when i am student it was more important to me to learn fact than to understand ideas and concepts because i get usaful from them by when i used these facts in my daily life so the result of this experience that i have alot of information i use it in my daily activites .second , in this way when you learn facts you will become a clever person and in thin way you will be good and smart in school or university .in the end , i like to advice people to do iy
