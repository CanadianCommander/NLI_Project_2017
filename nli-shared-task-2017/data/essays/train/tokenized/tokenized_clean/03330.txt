some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects whereas others support to specialize in one subject .in my opinion , notwithstanding a person should have knowledge of all related academic subjects , to specialize in one specific subject is most appropriate in compliance with this century .we are living in a century in which it is easy for everyone to reach information about nearly anything at anytime they wish .however this knowledge is generally too surface based .therefore the level of knowledge determines the difference between an academic person and non-academic person .to specialize in one academic subject prevents a person from spreading his energy , effort and time to too many things at the same time and helps to contrate on that one subject whereas broad knowledge of many academic subjects shall only result with a lot of unnecessary , unclear and ambiguos knowledge which ends up with no contribution to academics at all .the areas that agrees to specializaton has been increased by the development of technology .science has been seperated to much more branches than it was fifty years ago .for example principles such as law and medicine encourages people to specialize in one specific subject since it is impossible to learn to a subject deeply with a surface based knowledge .thus , i believe that considering the easiness and quickness at reaching information , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in order to draw a difference between academic and non academic .
