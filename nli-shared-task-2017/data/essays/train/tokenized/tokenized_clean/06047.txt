there are many forms to travel to somewhere , many people prefer to travel alone , others in a group , some of them without tour guide and others acompanied or led by a tour guide .i think that the best way is traveling in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons : you knows where are you going in order to have a security , you increase your knowledge from the tour guide about other place , and you save time to do other activities .firt of all , it is important to know where you are going in order to have a security .there are many places to know in the world or just in your country .the places look nice on the pictures however each place has its particular risk that we do not know loking the picture .i remember when i went to amazonas river without tour guide , i had a bad experience in this trip .secondly , if you travel to somewhere it is a good idea to learn about this place and improve your knowledge about other place .the best way to learn is hiding a tour guide because they are trained and they know very well the place that you are visiting .i remember an experience in machu pichu .when i arrived to cuzco my group looked for a tour guide .we really enjoyed in this trip because the guide teach us everything , he gave us all the historical of every place .finally , being led by a tour guide is a good idea to save time in your trip , because you are not worried about the map or you are not worried about the names of the different places .however in this time you can enjoy more visiting other places or write your history or write emails to your friends .definitelly , i recomend it is a good idea to enjoy more in your trips being led by a tour guide .in summary , there are more advantages having a tour guide like to support a job , to make other friend ( guide ) in other country , but i consider that the most important reasons are : security , knwoledge , and time .
