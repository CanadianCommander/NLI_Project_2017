a person that is educated is highly regarded while , an uneducated person might sometimes be seen down upon .knowledge is a way of knowing that many people should praise upon and take this advantage to their own good .i do agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have of one only .this way a person would know a great deal of things in more than one thing and he/she would normaly share their knowledge with other people and get also information about other subjects themselves .an example might be , a person that specializes in a particular field of study such as chemistry and another person that has abroad knowledge of a lot of subjects including chemistry meet up .the first person might only discuss chemistry while the other , person discusses more than one subject .to me in this situation the person with the broad knowledge is infact , smarter and more experienced than that person that specialize in chemistry .because that person might not answer or feel lost when the other person talks about other topics .another reason , might be that the person with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects migh find it easier to understand and learn about various topics .on the other hand the person that is specialized in a single subject might find it difficult to cope with the other topics that might be introduced to him/her .an example would be if he business major student was in a contest with the other students that take business and other subjects .he/she might win or gain points in answering questions that deel about business but , when it comes to answering other questions he/she might have a hard time answering it .again i do stand by my opinion that , a person should have great understanding in many academic subjects rather in one .who knows when that person needs to persuade another person in an area other than his/her own .it might be helpful if they know information in more than one topic .
