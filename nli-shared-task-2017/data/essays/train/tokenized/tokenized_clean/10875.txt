the major aim of young people of this century is following the popular trends .they do not know anything about politics and recent developments in science .they follow the concerts of madonna instead of following technological developments .the youth is careless about their community .besides , they see their friends who have concerns about the community as antisocial .i do not know many young people caring about their community .in fact , most of them do not have any idea about their community .they only care about computer games , partners that they meet by internet and the latest trends around the world .in other words , they are not interested in anything important like how they can help their community .they think that they do not have any responsibility for their community .for instance , paris hilton who is known by almost all young people does not have any idea about who is the president of england .she is also young and she is a role model for youth with such a little knowledge .i have to state that there are some people who concern about their community in the set of young people .however they are not seen as role models .instead , they are the most antisocial group according to young people who do not have any concern about future of their community .they think that you are a creature coming from space when you want to talk about important issues such as politics or problems of the community .i believe that the youngs should also follow important issues in addition to famous trends .nowadays young people do not give not only enough time but also no time in order to help their community .they do not have any concerns about future .also , they see youngs who want to help comminity as asocial .all nations should take some measures about these problems .otherwise i can not imagine the world with countries that have presidents chosen from these careless youngs .
