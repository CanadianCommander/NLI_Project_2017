some people may think that younger people enjoy their life more than old people , whereas other people might find the elder part of life more joyful .mainly because youth in our hedonistic society on the eve of capitalism is often seen as the ultimate good , most people may tend to agree with the first opinion .on tv , in the newspapers the fun that young people have is shown .not just the so - called stars of hollywood or elsewhere try to stay forever young , is it through fashion or the benefits of plastic surgery .so after all , there must be something about it .and , yes , it is definitely fun to be young .your body is healthy and maybe beatiful , you are free and everything is new and exiting , the book of life is not written yet , everything seems within your reach .so youth is , frankly said , a wonderful thing .but the problem is , that in a society where youth seems to be all , being old seems to be the odd counterpart .who wants to think about being old , not able to move properly , maybe dependend on medicine and not able to think in new ways ?but in my opinion , their can be certain benefits in the later ages , too .you maybe have a lovely wife or husband and a familie that gives you all the fulfilment you have dreamt of when you whre still young .whereas youth can be a big struggle in the dark , the age brings the advantage of experience with it .furthermore one can maybe afford nice things like big sports cars , houses in the provence or younger women young men just could dream of .so after all i think that both ages could be great fun , it certainly depends on your personal situation and the personal ideas about every age .according to this a pure culture of youth is doubtlessly a mislead in cultural development , especially regarding to the demographic changes that will turn us soon into a society of elder people .
