even though a travel with a tour guide is more comfortable , safe , convenience , i disagree that it is the best way to travel .there are several reasons to support my idea .first , a group travel is not memorable and useful .i experienced both types of trips .when i accompanied with a male guide , he solved every problems and arranged all reservations .therfore , i could spend very peaceful time in japan .however , it did nt give any useful experiences to me , and i totally forgot all my trip quickly .on the other hand , i went to china by myself .i reserved my airline ticket and hotel .also , i tried to communicate with chinese people with chinese to find some famous places , to buy gifts and to eat traditional foods .i met diverse people and learned a lot how to prepare for a trip .sometimes it was too tired to do anything .however , it was so exiting and exotic .eventually , i still remember everything in china .therefore , i do not agree with this statement that a group trip is the best way .next , a group travel is fixed .whenever i encounter many new interesting places in other countries , i would like to change my schedule .however , it is impossible in a group travel since a guide have to arrange all tourists .in contrast , i can handle my plans accoding to my interest if i travel alone by myself .i can go everywhere i want to .in india , i met a kind woman .she was interested in my country and me , so she wanted to invite me to her house .i could accept easily her suggestion because i was alone .i met her husband and her three children , and she prepared very wonderful dinner for me .moreover , i selpt in her house .i experiences indian traditional house , and saved my money .for these reasons , i think a group travel with a guide is not the best way to travel .even though i may encounter dangerous or strange situation , i prefer traveling alone .
