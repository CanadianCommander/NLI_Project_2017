in general , i would say that both are important and they complement to each other .in my experience , i would say that it is more advantageous for students to undertand ideas and concepts than to learn facts ; although , this may not be true in all cases .firstly , the study of facts is based on the understanding of concepts and ideas .it is not possible for a student to understand properly a fact if he or she does not have a basic knowledge of the ideas an concepts which constitute the basis of these facts .secondly , while the study of facts is based on memory , the study of ideas and concepts allows students to use their reasoning in order to understand the causes and effects of things or facts .the understanding of concepts allow them to establish relationships between different concepts as well as their causes and effects .however , it is also important to take into consideration that each educational method has its own advatages or disadvantages according to the student .for some students it is easier to learn through facts , while other students understand better through concepts and ides .these differences depend on the type on intelligence of the student .the study based on the understanding of concepts or facts varies according to each profession .for example , philosophers learn based on abstract concepts and ideas ; which they identify in facts .on the contrary ,i conslusion , i belive that understanding ideas and concepts provide students with more valuable tools and skills for their future lifes .however , there might be some cases in which it might be more beneficial for a student to learn based on facts .
