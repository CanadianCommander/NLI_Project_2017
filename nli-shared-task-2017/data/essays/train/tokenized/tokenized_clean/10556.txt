successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i completely agree with this statement .most of the people are not willing to take risk in their life .this is due to their fear of failure .their ideas , views and opinions remain confined to themselves .they are not willing to take the risk of impling their ideas and therefore gradually stop thinking about the various alternate ways and means of doing things .one can be successful only if he is ready to take risk .the first and the foremost benifit of taking risks is that you get the first movers advantage .you will be the only one to know it !for example in case of business enterprise , if the manufacturer takes the risk of investing its funds in the innovation department for the development of better quality products with efficient use of resourses and new technique of production then they get the advantage of being the first one to introduce such a product in the market .they can fix the price as they have no compatition and earn huge profits .also , there are some other advantages of taking risks like the bigger risk you take the bigger the gain will be !but at the same time i will call it more like a gamble .it involves a lot of uncertainities and some times what you expect will not happen at all .at that time you will have to face the consequences .the best way to handle the problem of `` risk taking  is to look at the probabilities .if the event is most likable to happen then take the risk and if there is any doubt about it take a smaller risk .but remember the bigger risk the bigger gain and hence only the people who take risks become successful in life .
