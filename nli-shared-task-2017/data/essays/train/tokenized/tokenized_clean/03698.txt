i agree with the staement that , most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they really are .i feel that most of the advertisements either in electronic or in print or any other media is nowadays , concentrate more on look rather than the usability or features of the product .for example a clothing company tries to spend a lot on the models and presnetation rather than the comfort while wearing its product .creating the hype and fuss is the only motive of such advertisements , although public may not like the product at all after few uses of it , e.g. a big multistarrer movie might be opened with a big lavish event , but after few days of show only , public comes to know whether it s a hit or a flop .this is one case where extra hype is created for a product by advertisements .in other cases , the side effects of the product are tried to make hidden behind the attractive advertisement .for example , aerated drinks , cosmetics etc , which are not good for health .in few cases , cosmetics have been proved very dangerous , when used frequently .cases have been found that after using cosmetics from a reputed company , the customers have generated allergic and skin problems due to toxic material present in it .although the advertisemnt doesnt mention any appropriate frequency of usage , it effect is visible after long usage only .in such cases it is all upto the public which has to find out the consequence after sometime .another example is alcoholic dinks and tobacco products , which are pretty much dangerous to health are advertised in such a way that it appeals to the mass population .as we can see , in most of the advertisements , which come out newadays focus more on packaging and making the product more attractive , rather than projecting there attributes related to general use .
