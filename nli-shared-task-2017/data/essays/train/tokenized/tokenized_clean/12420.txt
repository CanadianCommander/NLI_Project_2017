this is a topic that sometimes turned over in my mind and i think that is not so easy give a corret answer also because probably does nt exist a real corret answer .i think that for the students is important understand concepts and ideas but without learn facts they do nt have a complete knowledge .is sure that if the students know only the facts they are like `` parrots  so they could only repeat in a mechanic way the informations , but if they undertand the main ideas and concepts they could do an elaboration and express also their opinion about the matter .so i think that understand the main ideas is of paramount importance and learn fact is important but not enough .in other words i think that undertand the gist is really important also if you do nt know very well the particular facts but is not possibly the reverse , the fact without the main ideas are unusefull .i must confess that i did nt used to study a lot in the school , so i was nt sometimes able to remember very well dates and particular facts but with a good knowledge of the concepts i could be safe .the problem is also that many theachers think that the facts are so important and want that the students only repeat like a machine the information .i think also that for them is easier theach facts that try to explain the main ideas but fortunatelly not all the theacher are the same .i always really appreciated the thaechers that do nt try to give only informations but want that the students undertand the concepts and reformulate the ideas with their own opinion .finally i can say that is incorret say that is most important understand that learn but is sure that without the first one we have an `` robot knowledge  .
