`` i know not how the third world war is going to be , but i know that fourth world war is going to be with stones and sticks  , this is a famous quote by sir albert einstein .today is world of rapid technological and industrial advancement , the day is not far when there is a saturation of sources eventually leading to retrogradation of the society .i would absolutely agree that in the next twenty years ther would be fewer cars than they were today .i remember reading the poems of william wordsworth , beautifully describing the countryside and mother nature .in today s world it is indeed impossible to find such a place in real .right from the inception man is driven by a quest for knowledge .there is an urge or a curiosity to know and to find out things around him .this has definitely led to the industrial revolution .one of the biggest achievements has been the invention of the automobiles .with the development of cars and other means of trasnport the world had definitely become a smaller place .conveyeance was made easier and effective .but one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it has created .i would like to state an example , i live in a big city and it takes me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometers away from my house .i will have plan out things before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far as it literally takes me years to reach my destination .there has been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobiles .this pollution not only effects the environment but also to living beings .the number of cases of asthma and other lung diseases have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicles .there are cases of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead components released by the vehicles .in earlier days , cars were a status issue .people who were wealthy only could afford a car .it is no longer so .although people are able to buy cars but the maintainance of cars is a difficult task in todays s wrold .it is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it .today there is an increasing urge to go green by reducing the individual contribution to go green .people are reverting to the use of cycles and bikes which use plants as fuel .people are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destinations .hence i would like to conclude that although there is a continuous rise in the number of cars , after a span of twenty years the number of cars will reduce due to increasing awareness among people .
