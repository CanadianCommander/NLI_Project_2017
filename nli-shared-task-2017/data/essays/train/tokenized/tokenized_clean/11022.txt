life is perceived differently by different kinds of people .similarly young people enjoy life more than elders do can be stated only by viewing perspecrtives of life partially .what i mean to say is that i do not agree with the fact that young people enjoy more than the elders do completely .in my opinion youth can be viewed as stage of physical stength and vigour and also as a stage of stress and responsibility .in youth every day is a challenge and one can not afford to while away the time they have .therefore it becomes more stressful for young people .one has to attend their studies , fund their studies and at the same time earn for a living , compete with their fellow classmates for the first position .then comes a stage of choosing-choose a career that shall decide everything and choose a life partner with whom one has to spend the rest of their life .once satisfied about the stage of settlement , then comes the stage of feeling responsible for one s children , their education , desires and their settlement .inspite of all these difficulties youth is an age of pleasure , vigour , adventures , friendship and love .it is a blessed state , usually with constant good health that gives an oppurtunity to experiment and make the most of life .i feel unfortunate are those who do not realise the importance of youth and neglect the age under the pressure of responsibility .old age to me in a stage of peace where one has to enoy the fruit of all the hardwork one has done during their lifetime .since elder people are often subjected to brunt of illhealth and illness they have to enjoy life to the maximum in the destined duration of old age that they have .therefore , i opine that one has to perceive life beautifull , all stages have their own importance and each stage should be enjoyed with an optimistic attitude .only then can one realise the importance of ouer birth .
