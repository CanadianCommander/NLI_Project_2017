nowadays it s clearly impossible to run away from advertisement .at home or on the street , even when you drive a car you may see advertisement on buses .it seems to be very difficult to escape from it .but what are advertisements made for ?usually they are made to attract peaple or to get their attention and finnaly to sell the product which the advertisement is made for .many peaple complain about the way advertisement is presented .they see every kind of advertisement as an illusion of goods that in fact do nt represent what is said about them .but do advertisements make products better then they really are ?if you consider most of the advertisements you may discover afterwards that they do nt lie but they hide information .for example in some advertisements they claim that their yoghurt has a lot of vitamins that make you healthy .unfortunately the same yoghurt has alos a lot of fat and ohter ingredients that can do harm your body .this is a big problem for every consumer and for the government as well because it is pretty diffucult to find a solution for it .you ca nt prohibit companies to do advertisement .so the hidden information will be existing also in the future .furthermore advertisement is seen as everything that appears on screen that is shown between films or series .so whats about cigarettes ?in germany for example cigarettes are shown in advertisment as a cause of cancer and a lot of other illnesses .this is a kind of advertisment that does nt make the product better .it does the opposite by showing how harmful cigarettes are .nevertheless advertisement is there to get peaples attention to buy a product . .how can you reach this goal many companies ask themselves .one option is advertisement , and as there is so much competition companies have to invent facts that make it more interesting .as we know that most things said in advertisments are not true we know that this is just a stragey to catch the peaples eye and make them interested in their product .in my opinion it s true that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .despite the exceptions mentioned above , advertisement uses wrong or different facts to improve their products .
