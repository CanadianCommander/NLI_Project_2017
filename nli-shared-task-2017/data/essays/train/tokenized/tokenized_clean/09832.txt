there are a diferents situation that successful people trying new things , and successful people who do not tried .i think that successful people always try new things because they try to success in diferents aspects but i think this is not correct .obviusly that if you want to be succes first you have to know well what you have to do it .in this circunstance you will have to have a good preparation in the aspect or in the situation that you want to success .for example i want to success in my career i am a lawyer and i wanto to be a well know lawyer in my country in that circunstances i know that i have to work very hard to do it , no trying new things just doing what i really know and doing well the tings that i really know in this way i sure that i wiil success .because if you tried to succes doing new things i think sometimes you can doing something that is nor correct or bad things it does not matter your intention , the things is that that you have to be sure what you are doing .in my specific case i can not try to do new things becuase i am a lawyer and i was prepare for a specific area that is commercial and civil law , and i was study a lot about this subject , and i really honest with me and with my clients when someboy ask me if i can help them with other area such as criminal law , human right or enviromental law , that are very interesting but i do not know anytihing about and them and is not correct for me to tell that this area that mention above i know and help them becuase in this way i will never success .in conclusion i think a reall successful people just do it what they already know .i am not agree with this statement becuase you can not tried new things if you do not well what you are doing .always in better to grow up carefully taking all the value that it is neccesary .and doing well what you really know .
