young people enjoy life more than older people do ?yes , i agree with this opinion .obviously , today we enjoy our live more than older generation , because we face a differnet time .first , with the development of our society , the young people have more chance to learn about different life in this planet by tv programs , internet or another media .young man always has a great interested in the new things .they like to enjoy different life and eager to get more amazing experience .for example , in china so many older people cost so many time to care for their grandchildren , or stay at home to watch tv .they always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again .but for young people , they can invite some friends to climb mountain or drive car to someplace , even though they have no much money .they don not want to waste their time when they are young .second , as we all konw , in china the older generation must work harder and harder , because our parents were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family .they spent their time in working .when they want to enjoy the rest of life , they have already had no time or no interest about something .but now so many young people were born in good family , they can enjoy their life as they want , because their family can afford their consum .in recent year , so many young boy were sent to aborad to study by their parents .under the help of their parents , they can enjoy a new life in forigen countries , they can do anything if they want to do .that is a big differnece between young generations and older generations in china .according to these examples , we found that the young people live in more good conditions and good famlies .they can choose their life and enjoy more than their parents .
