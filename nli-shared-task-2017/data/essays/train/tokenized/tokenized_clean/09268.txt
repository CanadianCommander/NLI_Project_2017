i would like to give a great support to understand ideas and concept then to learn fact .for example we will start with that everything is write in books , journals , magazine and other supporting material of reading , so how can we develop our approach to think about any topic and search a lot of things related to that topic .we can not depend only on book knowledge thus it is essential to create scientific and creative approach in our mind we should become to understand ideas and concept of evary topic in every field .if we want to start my carreer as a research scholar and other scientific field , we want to learn different concept .a memorable moment in my life about these type of thinking .when i was in my undergraduate study courses , my professor asked to make question about topic gluconeogenesis and i saw no interested on that topic and learned everything which was present in the book .the next day my professor asked me about question and i asked a lot of thing which was present in book but there is new nothing .at that time my professor give me advise to thinks about such topis which make my study more convenient and reliable and develop my approach towards scientific knowledge .that day and today i remember my professor voice .i do not say that learning the fact is not so essential to a student but i would like to say that learn the facts and begin to create your ideas and concept of that topic in advance .by this method we can save our lot of time and we use that time in a lot of work .in the departmental libraries and other places of book storage we can study about any topic and create our basic approach .thus in the last but not least i would like to prefer for a student to understand ideas and concept than to learn facts for creating your scientific and intelletual approach in every field of life .
