i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .first of all , i think there is almost no profession only dealing with one academic subject .for example , if you study english literature , you also need historical , cultural and linguistic knowledge to be successful in understanding your own subject .or if you plan to become a physicist , you need extented knowledge in biology , chemistry and especially mathematics .furthermore , to be specialized in only one subjects causes remarkable difficulties in private as well as public life .your relationships will be limited to people of your own specific subjects and you are not able to connect or communicate with other people because you can not understand them and vice versa .if you talk to a biologist who does not know anything about any other topics , you will not be able to talk to him because there is nothing that connects you .the most important argument for favoring a broad knowledge rather than a very specific one is very personal .for me it is very important to gain a broad general knowledge because i think people with limited specific knowledge also have a limited emotional ability .i am sure that people who read a lot of different kinds of texts can much easier relate to the problems of other people than people who tend to read texts exclusively dealing with one subject .people with knowledge of many subjects can understand situations although they will never have to face them , whereas people with restricted knowledge will not be able to deal with those situations because they are beyond their limited horizon .in conclusion i may say that a broad knowledge of many subjects makes more sense than to specialize in one specific subject .people belonging to the first group have advantages in many different situations , such as academical , professional , interactional as well as emotional ones , as stated above .
