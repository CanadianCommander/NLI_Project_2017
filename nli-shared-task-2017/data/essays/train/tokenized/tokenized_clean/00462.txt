i disagree with the statement which is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i will disscus and give the reason as follows .first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide makes you not to think .i personally think the travelling would be more fun and interesting if i make my own plan .if i travel in a group led by a tour guide , i end up just chatting with people and following a tour guide .after that kind of travel , i would not remember anything .for example , when i was in middle school and high school , i went to school trip led by a tour guide .even though the place i went was kyoto which is most beautiful city in japan and they have most valuable and interesting temples , nothing really remein in my mind after the trip because i was just part of the group and following a tour guide without thinking .i think i wasted great opportunity by doing that .second , hiring tour guides cost more money .i rather spend same amount of money on eating well during my travel instead of hiring a tour guide .if i could get most of the information tour guides provide by reading travel guide or searching on internet , i do not think it worth to pay that much money for a tour guide .especially , now a days , because of the development of the internet , we could easily find information in free .third , travel in a group with tour guide makes trip too touristic .most of the tour guide only take people to the major spot and suvenior shop they have commitment .but there are more things we could see besides those sightseeing spots .for example , when i traveled to new york first time , i was not led by a tour guide , but eventually , i get to visit not only most of the major spot but also happened to discover a lot of interesting spot none of the tour guide would take people to .in conclusion , i disagree with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .my favorite way to travel is either with family of close friends , and make our own plan .it gives me more fun and opportunity for learning and experience .
