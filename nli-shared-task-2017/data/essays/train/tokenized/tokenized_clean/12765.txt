i disagree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know .because tring new things are very diffcult .if people get a lot of money from success something , they should nt try new things .they should expand a job which same category from befor they successed .first , i would like talk about why it is difficult that people who sucsessed own job try a new job which they do nt have any skills and knowledge about it .i think if autally diffarent category job , people who try to new category s job need much time to make a base .now , our world was developed with technology , so speed is very important for work .if takes a much time , it might br bad effect .second , it s difficult to paticipate new category s job , because there are many companies already .of course , thoses companies have had better skills .thay also have good relationship each companies even though they are enemies .for example .my friend eho has a own company which is it successed on his job , but after that , he build a new compane which is model production .he lost his money .because he did nt know the relationship about other companies , so other company hit his company .thereforer , i disagree that succcesful people try new things and take risks rather than doimg waht they already know .
