in response to the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , i agree .successful people has a vision and has the ability to transform it into reality .take for example the czech immigrant nikolo tesla .he was a brilliant scientist who invented the induction generator which generated alternating current .this was at a time when the authority on power and transmission of power was thomas alva edison who had invented direct current .tesla was able to show that transmission losses in alternating current over large distances were negligible as opposed to tremendous losses in direct current which made transmission of direct current for distances greater than two miles , virtually impossible .tesla had a vision of an induction generator generating alternating current which by virtue of its properties would suffer little attenuation during transmission .he also had the expertise and knowledge to invent one .this gave him success which he richly deserved .successful people are also be able to take a calculated risk in trying new things .after all , nothing ventured , nothing gained .a case in point is , mr westinghouse .in an era where edison s word was gospel , he chose to back a minnow by the name of nikolo tesla because he could visualise the profits that could be accrued if the concept of alternating current were a success .he invested in a 66 mega watt power generation project for alternating current based on tesla s design , which changed the way mankind used domestic and industrial electric power , forever .westinghouse is now synonymous with power generation now .this could happen only because westinghouse believed in tesla s concept and though it was not proved at that time , risked a major investment in the venture and was willing to gamble on the success of the project .however , it must be said about the most prolific inventor of our times , thomas alva edison , that for every invention of his which worked there were seven which would not .he did not give up .he persevered and continued with his passion which made him a successful man .preseverence is also a major virtue in successful people .
