i hardly remember any incident when some young elder member of the communities had offered to help in anyway .the growing globalisation and ever-incresed competetion sees to it that everyone becomes self-celtred and work for one s own gains , thus reducing any chances of social services or social commitment .i totally agree that the youth are not sparing enough time helping to there communities .if we check out any field , be it academic or non-academic , we see that there is an inceresing competetion .so , to survive in the world of competetion and to retain his place in this very tough world the youth are driven to focus on their career aspects and to continuously spend huge amounts of time bettering their prospects for a better future .moreover , we constantly see a continual decipline in the moral and ethical standards in any community .and the people who are more into degraded morals and ethics are the youth .the degradation of moral values leves them so hollow that they can hardly think about communities , let alone helping them .this moral degradition can be seen quit predominantly in any part of the world today .someone rightly said `` man is driven by desires  .the `` desires  of today s youth have become so intense and so uncontrollable that they can harldy resists these desires , and moreover they are being driven by the not-so-good desires .describe to advance positively is alwas conducive to ones personality .with never and newer technologies arriving in this world , the youth are engagging themselves in taking advantages of these technologies .for example , with newer viedio games in the markets , the youth are driven to purchase them and spend most of their time in playing games .this culture of playing vedio game kills the time , so that individual can harldly think about the time to helping thei communities .in conclusion , i believe that young people not giving enough time to helping thei communities .
