in modern statistic , 90 % of the public prefer to study specific knowledge .in my openion , to suporte this , it is better to have specialize and specific knowedge for several reasons .you will be able to organize your think , focus on specific details and increase the opportunity to offer a jub for every body .first of all , if a student took chemestry as a his own major he is not going to be buildired between the other materials such as physics , history etc .so , his think will be related to chemestry and he is going to be successful with his major .secondley , the student want to success in his major by giving his concentration to the material he studies .as we can see , the student will be capable in his major .if he took music as a major beside chemestry , he is going to struggle with these different sciences .these days , everybody want a specific job .so , if we give everybody the broad knowledge , all of them become qualified at the same rate which means lacking the chances to have a perfect job .on the other hand , if we have students who are specialists in different knowledge , the oppourtunity to hav of , course , a job will increase
