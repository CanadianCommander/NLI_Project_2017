`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .i think that is not true and i will explain here why on my own experience .when i was at the faculty , i was the manager of a place inside the university that was maintained only by volunteer students .it is a place where from 7:30 am to 6 pm students can come .they can rest , have something to eat during all day ( sandwiches , snack food , croissant , pancakes ... ) , play babyfoot or chess or other games .they can also read newspapers , listen to music they like or come for concerts in the evening .the question is why is that helping our community .the aim of this place is not at all to make money and profits .people that manage this place where not paid , only students working to make food were paid .these young people are hired on the basis that they really need this money and that they ca nt get help from their parents .specially in my faculty ( faculty of science ) , it is very difficult to get a job in addition to going to the university because generally we got about 30 hours of courses a week .these students working for us only works 6 hours a week so they can find time to do it .we organise also twice a month on thursdays a concert generally organized by an another association where all the profits from the night are given to this association .for example , one of the association needed the money to buy some toys to distribute it to children that have to spend christmas at the hospital .all the benefits we do each year which is not much is automatically invested for local  or for new materials such as tables , chairs , light for the scene .so i think on my experience and on what i have seen is that young people still do their best to help others as much as they can .
