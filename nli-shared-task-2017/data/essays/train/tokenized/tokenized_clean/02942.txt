i quite agree with that opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .there are some reasons why i agree with this opinion .you can find new interests , new friends and can take advantage to the other people .first , you will find new interests if you studied many kinds of academic subjects .some university force to student to study only the subject which the student major .it is also important to specialize in one subjects , but it must discrease your unknown ability .and it can connect to your future .the knowledge which you studied is never be bad thing but very useful when you graduate from the university .second , you can find new friends .if you take only the subjects you major , the range of friends is very narrow .if you major business but interested in history , you should take history class .there are many students who have same interests and you can not meet them in the bussiness department .they can be your best friends and can be good rival in your life .finally , deepen the knowledges about many kinds of subjects advantage to the other people .i m studying english because i want to communicate with many people around the world and get the fine job which have the opputunity to use english .however , there are many people who can speak english in the world .i thought haw can i take advantage to ither people who can speak english .so i decided to study many kind of academic subjects .if you have a lot of knowledge , you can get the job which you want to .to broad knowledge of many academic subjects is obviously increase your ability and the path which connect to your future .so i agree with the statement perfectly .
