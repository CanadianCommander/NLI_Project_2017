an education system should be capable of giving to the students all the elements in order to be a better persons and professionals .obviusly , understanding ideas and concepts is very important for the students for learnig and analize things , but i think that is not enough .students should have all the elements in order to resolve problems and face conflicts in the future .learning specifics facts , like history facts or gramar facts , is important , but is not the only way to get a complete education .the specific facts , students learn them for the exam and forget next day , but if the teachers teach them how to connect ideas , how to understand concepts , how to make a connection between this with that , students will have the elements to be a sucesfull people .an student can know everything about history or maths or maybe chemistry , buy if he ca nt make a logical conexion between facts and ideas , it does nt make any sense .when students have to face on working expirience , they wo nt need specifical facts that they learn in school , they will need the capacity of conecting ideas and understanding concepts .the last sentence does nt mean that facts , as dates or formulas or specifics things , students does nt need them in working life , probably will probably wo nt , but i think that understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable for a company when they want a good employer .students needs an education that provides them a lot of elements to resolve problems , create ideas , connect concepts and anything can help them to be a person who can face any problem or situation succesfully .
