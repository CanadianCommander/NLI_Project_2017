i would like to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .there are several reasons why i prefer this way .first , a fact can be more easily to use if you know the concept of it .if you do nt have any idea about some facts , you ca nt go further step in order to improve your ability .for example , let s say you know many formulas about math , but does nt know how to use it .of course it is really important to know formulas .but , when you have a math test , you will be confuse because you have no idea what the formulas mean .you ll have variety of facts , but you ca nt use it properly .by contrast , if you understand the concept of the formulas , you know how and when to use it .secondly , if you know the concepts of something , it is easily to understand the facts .this is because you feel comfortable when you have some images that are related to the facts .i can say this by using example from math formulas again .if you have images of basic formulas , you should nt have hard time to memorize many formulas at the same time .sometimes i get confuse when i encounter to new rules we use in the math class .this is because i do nt have a basic understanding about formulas , which means i have no ideas about it .when i know how to prove why the formula can be used , i have deep idea about it , so it is not painful to memorize it .also , if i know some backgrounds of these formulas , i do well on the math exam .finally , you can improve in some ways by understanding the concepts .when i play golf , the ball curve from right to left .if i want to fix this curving , i ca nt just shots millions of balls until i could finally make it straight .at first , i have to know why and how a golf ball makes a curve .this part is the concept .once i got some basic ideas , now i can hit and try some different swings in order to make the ball straight .
