as far as i am concerned , i take side for the idea that it is more essential and useful to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .first and foremost , it is worth mentionning that a strong aquaintance is based on the ability to classify facts and events .indeed , for instance , in order to understand historical events , it is unefficient to accumulate facts in a chronological order .what is really thought-provoking is to be able to identify why it has occured .to identify that , you must be aware of philosophical theories or political movements .thus , i personnaly believe you have to learn concepts and ideas to have a clear idea of history and to understand better facts .furthermore , knowing an accumulation of facts is useless .as a matter of fact , it does not allow students to face all situations .there is a striking issue ; students who study economy need to know what is liberalism or keynesianism but not the little event that arose in an unknown company .eventually , students have to prepare them to be efficient and dynamic on the labor market .broadly speaking , i think that learning ideas and concepts build your ability to face predicament or dilemnas .in a company , when you take a decision , it is not only important but also , to me , mandatory to refer yourself to a concept in order to defend your viewpoint and your action .a wellknown idea or concept may lead your boss to trust you about the efficiency of your action .to conclude , i personnaly believe that ideas and concepts are crucial for a strong and logical knowledge in university .moreover , i think that it is essential to adapt to the labor market .
