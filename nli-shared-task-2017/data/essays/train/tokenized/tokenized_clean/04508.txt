i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i think that we have to `` open our mind  to everything because we live in a global society , so we should have many interests .a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects could create different interests .an interest grows through teaching many academic subjects in schools .i studied many subjects in the secondary school , for example latin , math , italian literature , history , philosophy , biology and i appreciated many views of these subjects .now i have many interests and i am able to understand different point of view or discussions .i think that a knowledge in one specific subject is wrong .
