i do totally agree with the statement .for me , there is nothing more important than understanding ideas and concepts .it s a shame that most school-systems concentrate more on learning by hard then understanding ideas .the schools missed all important achievements of the last 50 years .they focus on learning facts , not on understanding facts .in my eyes , it s possible to pass school only by learning facts without understanding them .even in universtity , in several subjects , for example in some economic-subjects , it s possible to get along with learning facts .but for university you shoud fullfill other requirements .if you try to pass live only by learning facts , you have the wrong point of view .you can not repeat facts all the time , once in your live you have to come to the point where you understand the links between several topics and where you are able to produce your own ideas .on the other hand you can not achiev anything only by understanding ideas and concepts .once understood , you have to learn several things by hard .the best example is to learn a language .you can understand all the grammar - but without vocabulary you wo nt be able to have a conversation in this language .i know a lot of smart students who are able to understand ideas very fast .but when they understood the ideas , the do not think about them anymore , they do nt learn them by hard , and , as fast as they understood the ideas , they forget them .it s a waste of talent , they do not recognize that you have to work hard for good results .they are not used to .and , no matter of my opinion , i did also realize how important it is to learn facts , and how difficult it is .but learning facts must never be the more important point of studies .for only learning facts , we do nt need human beeings , computers are better in storing information without thinking of it .as long as we think of the facts we learn , we learn the right way , the way you need to learn to be a good student .
