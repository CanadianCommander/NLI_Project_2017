i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do this maybe because of my personnal experience .actually , i am a young student still in high school and think that i really do enjoy life more than my parents for example .i am saying this because being young meens not a lot of reponsibility and a lot more freedom .first , i want to say that as a young student i am not responsible for a lot of things in my life .of course , except the education success but this could also be my decision , to be successful or not .nevertheless young people are not resposible for any criminal act : when a young boy is for example charged of something , the parents take full responsibiliy .in addition , young people have no job stress , they only have a school to worry about but no more and the work done at school could not be compared to the work of a real job .we have no responsibility of living as our parents cover all our personal needs .we have then no responsibility of finding a job to be able to live .less responsibility , is more freedom .i think that young people have more time in every aspect of life .an important aspect are mistakes ; in fact we have more time when young to make mistakes and correct them .for example , i can make a bad decision choosing what i want to study , being young allows me to reconsider my decision and start another program or course on another field of study .i can see also from my situation that being old disadvantage you from doing a lot of activities .my father , who was a grat tennis player in his younger life have now a back problem and ca nt even run for a long period of time .i can not immagine myself not playing soccer when i grow older .being young means doing things that a lot of older people would nt do , like partying frequently .young people have this caracter that pushes them to go dance and spend a lot of time with friends and do a lot of things at the same time .with the reasons and examples stated before , i came to a conclusion that being young allows to enjoy life more than being old .this could be different for other people
