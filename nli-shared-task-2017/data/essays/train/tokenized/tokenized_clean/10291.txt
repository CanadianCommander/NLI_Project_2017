i agree with the idea which more and more young people lose their interest toward community works or voluntary works .then i wonder who is responsible for that .of course young peoele have responsibility by themselves .everytime i go out in tokyo , i see many young people who throw their gabbish on the street without any consideration .i wonder have they ever thought about cleenig crews who mostly works voluntarilly .i also see many young people sitting on priority seats in front of eldery people or handicaped-person on the train .they usually chat with their friends loudly or talikg on the cell-phones .i think these behavior exactly mirror the younger s attitude toward community works or voluntary works .i blamed japanese youngers , however , i think japanese government also have a responsibility for today s trend which young peopel do not give enough time to helping their communities .basically , japanese schools do not require students to work at their community or to joinn voluntary works and there are no class about how imporatnt helping community is .those lackness makes yound people lose their interest in community works .lastly , i also think community itself have a responsibility for young people .i am sure that young people do not spend enough time on community works , however , i want to ask the community that they have helped any young people or gave them advices in the community .unless community and young people find out the way that they support and help each other , there is no way that this situation will be changed .i think majority of young people do not give them time to help others in their community .however , i also know some young people are eager to work for their community only because they want to contribute their community .i think young people just have not realized how worth it is .if everybody will change in order to their community better , i belive that the number of young people who join community works will increse .
