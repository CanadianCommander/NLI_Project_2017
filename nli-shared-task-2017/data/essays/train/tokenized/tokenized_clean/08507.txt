i do agree with the following statement .i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i have several reasons to share : first of all , young people have usually much more energy than older people .for exemple , young people can go do all kind of sports like skydiving , scubadiving , dancing , and a lot of other sports , without really think about the heart or bones problems .second , yound people still have to live many years and experience many different things .a teenage wants to become independant and go to travel all around the world to make his own experiences , but older people are often already set with husband or wife , and with children , and prefer to relax at home during the week-end .third , yound people have much more free mind than older people .young people from today in france for example , live a life with a lot of comfort and do nt worry much about wars or hunger , but some grand-parents experienced the war and remember the difficulties of this time .some have resentments against germans for example , but young people live all together in peace germans , spanish people and all because they did nt live the war .fourth , young people can experience much more things with the evolution of the science .there are many innovations today that young people can use for their everyday life , that older people did nt have at their youth time .like the mp3 that can carry many songs and most of the young people use it .to conclude , i think it s normal that young people enjoy life more than older people do .everybody is young one day , and become old an other day .
