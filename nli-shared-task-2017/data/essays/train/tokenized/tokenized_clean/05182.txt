in my opinion you can be successful in a variety of ways , and as a result of different efforts .for instance you have the people that take many risks and innovate in the economy ; i think they are needed in the society and in the evolution of things , but they are not the only ones needed .in the other hand we have people that know how to do things and that stick to what they have learned in the process in order to be confident and efficient .successful people that take risks are generally agressive in their way of reacting to changes in the market and sometimes they will innovate without reason .they wo nt stay in peace when things have changed , and furthermore they will make changes to the way of making business and to their sorroundings .this kind of person does nt rests and is always thinking of ways to improve the odds of making a good deal , as an effect they will push others in the field to innovate too in order to survive .there is no recipe for success , so to think that taking risks will help you assure that you will have success is totally wrong .when sometimes taking risks could help , sometimes it could make more damage than estimated .certain kinds of persons have other characteristics that are important in the economy , those persons are the ones that stick to what they know and that are efficient in that way .this way of being gives them security and helps them to be efficient workers , confident of the way they react to the market and its changes .as a conclusion , there is market for everyone , and the different kinds of being are needed in the way
