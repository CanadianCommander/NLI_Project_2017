do you think that young people enjoy life moer than older people do ?i think that most people agree this statement .i think that it is natural that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .because young people have there things that it is hard for older people to get ; time , curiosity , and responsibility .first , young people have enough time to enjoy their life .young people have classes on school but it is not spend whole day and they have free time everyday .on their free time , they can do anything what they want to do , such as playing with friends , doing clubs , doing homeworks , and doing part-time jobs .also they can go everywhere they want to go .they do not think that they enjoy life more than older people , because they just killing their free time by doing something .they just use their time effectively .second , young people have much curiosity to enjoy their life .for young people , life is unexpectable and there seems many interest things .there are many wonderful things to challange .they act as soon as they think .sometimes , not thinkig carefully lead them dangerous but their curiosity make them have possibilities to get more specific knowlege and find something new and problems .third , young people do not have responsibility yet .they do not have limit for doing something and they also do not care about their fame of authorities .they will act before not thinking that their action is good or bad .when they feced some problems , they will notice the importance of responsibility .from these reasons , i think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .their free time , their curiosity , and their irresponsibility , sometimes , connect to their social experiences .by enjoying their life , they can get variety of knowlede , experiences , and moral and then they grow up to adaluts .
