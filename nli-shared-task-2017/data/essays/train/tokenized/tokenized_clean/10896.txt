i agree with try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .the world is changing very fast .do you think that you can live without the advance of skills or technology ?i do nt think so .the poeple are becoming more intelligence and talented than those of 100 years ago .human beings are always want to be advanced .first of all , even primitive people invented a lot of things to eat , hunt and retain the stuff .at first , they probably did nt know how to turn on the fire .they tried several times to get what they wanted to have .if they had not tried to get the fire , nobody would have gotten it .second , to live twentyfirst century is not easy , and thesedays the competitiveness is very fierce .the technology is advanced very high and everyday new products are coming to attract the customers eyes .even if someone has very unique skills , sooner or later the other person will imitate these skills or invent new skills .everyday is different , we have to invent new stuffs and think of new ideas .if no , we will never win others .finally , as i just said , now is very hard to be successful person without inventing our skills .we must know one thing before inventing something .we probably will fail sometimes while we are doing something .it can be happened .even though we fail , we have to keep make an effort to get what we are thinking .to invent news things or skills , people have to be very brave and take risk .for the first time , they might fail to invent but they do nt have to give up inventing .if they give up because of the scare of the fail , they will never be grown and get what they really want .being a successful person is not esay , we have to keep doing until we get what we think .
