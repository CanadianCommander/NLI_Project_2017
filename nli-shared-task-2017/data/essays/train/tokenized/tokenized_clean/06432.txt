in my opinion a lot of advertisement increase the desire of particular things in people and then it seem much better than another that are equal .such as shoes , there are some brand of shoes that make an advertisement by television , journal , and then guys will prefer a specifical brand than others , but there are nt a lot of differences by one or another s pair of shoes .the television play an important role about this topic , all the day on tv we can see a lot of advertisements and our choose can be influenced by this .a lot of people watch the tv and generally follow medias and the brands know this and then spent a lot of money for making them visible .sometimes if i am skilled about the thing ( such as computers , cars . .. )i can be aware that another unadvertise brand can be more efficiently , can be better , can have more quality than what i ve seen on tv , and this enforce the topic .when a brand spent some money for make it s advertise on tv the price of his products raise but not necessarly raise also the quality , but a lot of people buy him without knows the effectively quality , only because they have seem him on tv or others media .the charateristics of a product can be the same ( or less ) than another but if a product have a specifical sign on it will be more desiderable .many times the person who buy an advertise object can be not very happy of his article simply because will see another brands with more better charateristics than him .the advertise can be not exhaustive and can confuse the buyers , it making the product more better than it is really .the people that do nt interest about the effective quality of products that them buy often are unhappy because they spent so much and have a lower quality product .
