i am under the impression that advertisements in general do not make people believe that the products that they aim at selling is better than they really are .actually , as far as i am concerned , i think that the purpose of an advertisement is to emphasize the qualities of a good .of course , an advertisement will not highlight the defects of a good because it will not be attractive for people .the fact that a product is in reality not so better as it seemed is just a question of perception : it is a subjective problem .this brings us to the matter of the subjectivity .actually , one consumer can be satified by a good that he has bought whereas another consumer will not .the satisfaction about a good s qualities is to be linked with what every consumer research in it .it seems to me that there are no general rules that tell anyone what qualities are to be found in a specific good .it is up to each consumer to make up its mind .in that sense , to answer this question , we should make an opinion poll to know the peoples s opinion about the qualities they expected from the product and what they really think once they have received it .moreover i would like to mention the fact that before buying , you always have got the possibility to ckeck the product so that you can see by yourself if the product is what you expect it to be .i get the feeling that a good advertisement can make you think that what you will buy is a good product whereas in reality it is not .for example , if you buy a product that everybody knows because everybody has seen its advertisement , there will be a such phenomenom that everybody will want to possess it .this is the case of products that are said to be fashion .no matter how the qualities of the good are : because the advertisement is well-known and attractive , the fact that it might not be a good product does not matter .the fact that this product is attractive prevails .but one must bear in mind that in that case , the product is said to be good because you possess the last new product of a company and not because the product in question has real qualities .to put it into a nutshell , one could conclude by saying that the advertisement of a product has taken so much importance nowadays that it could make us forget to ckeck if we really need it and if it satisfies us .
