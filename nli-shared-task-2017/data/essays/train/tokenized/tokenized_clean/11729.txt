transportation and crowdedthere is a huge number of cars and truks nowdays .big number of thim are for transportation .is that huge number going to be reduced or increased in future ?that is very important quistion to ask ourselves and think deeply on this important issue .my own opinion is the number of cars are going to increase repidly .there are alot of ways to go and back in or out cities because there are more and more ways of transportation are discoverd .cars are the first modern kind of way we use for long time .now , we have another useful transportation as trains , buses and taxies .for example , we dont have these other kinds of transportations in saudi arabia , and we are suffuring from the crowded evry single day .other factor helps in decreasing number of cars used evry day is cars prices .it is increasing day than the other .it could cost you an arm and leg to buy a car these days .cars maker are chalinging each other not only in the quality , but also in the price .also oil prices are increasing and not steady .it is cheaper to go by train evry day to your work than taking your own car .another aspicte on oil is that it may vanish some day sudinly with out wrning .that would cause a disaster .w
