before presenting my point of view , i think it is necessary for me to examine the question carefully .which one is more important , learn the particular facts or acquired the concepts and general principles .it is a matter of balancing the pros and cons of these methos , the decision , therefore , is not easy to make .in my opinion , ideas and principle concepts are more important .the first and foremost reason in support of my positon is that it is impossible for us to learn every facts during our limited lifetime .take mathematics as an example , we could not do all the measue the three lenth of every triangle and it is easy to make some mistake .however , we could just calculate the length precisely and quickly by using the principle .another compelling facts in favor of my position is that facts are often to specific and not conviencing and we learn little from particular facts .a striking example is that many fever could be healed by keli .although in some clinical cases it would results in some side effect , we could not deny that it is not a good medicine just by observe such a specific `` fact  .i cite this extreme example merely in an attempt to demonstrate that we would make false decision by observing some specific facts .i can not deny that facts is important some times , for instance , in study history .historist must use numerous facts and evidences to prove their theory .this alone lend no strong support to undermine what i have substantiated .from the discussion mentioned above , i can finally draw a conclusition that it is more important for students to understand ideas .it make us solve problem more effectively and make right decisions .i just could not imagine how could we do our work if the know no fundamental concepts .
