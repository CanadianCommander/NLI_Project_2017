based on my current observation and personal experiece , i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .first of all , young people nowadays are too occupied by class work .take myself for example , when i was young school did not demand so much class work as they do today .my younger brother who goes to college now spend almost all of his weekend working on class projectes .he barely has anytime to do anything that he is interested in .while in the past , my college was not so demanding and i had much more free time to engage in cummunity activities .secondly , due to the advent of the internet and mobile phone , young people nowadays have very few connections with the communities .young people nowadays spend most of their time in their rooms surfing the internet or talking to their friends through the mobile phone .they seldom go out and meet people in the communities , not to mention offering any help to the communities .recently , i had a chance to visit a children hospital that i used to volunteered when i was in college .i was surprized by the few number of college students now volunteering there .finally , i find an obvious trend from recent newspapers and magzines ; the number of hosipital and non-profit organizaion lacking volunteer is increasing .especially , those activities that were traditionally carried out by young people .for example , the taiwanese government started a program some years ago to recruit young people to offer volunteer work overseas .recently , i read an article on the newspaper saying that now the government is having difficulties getting enough young people to help the communities .based on the three specific experiences and observation i decribed above , i agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not help their communities enough .
