carnot , a very famous french physician wrote three laws , one of wich i could translate this way : `` with time you gain in organisation what you lost in energy  .he was speaking of fundamental physics , but i think that this could be applied to human beings .when you are young , you are filled with energy and you intend to do or try everything , travelling around the world , practising extreme sports , as we say in french , burning the candle by both ends .but do we enjoy life more than old people ?answering this question is quite difficult for me , as i still have nt tried being an old man - it will come soon enought .but however , i think that you can enjoy your life , young or old , no matter your age .each age has its own pleasures : when you re young they may be a bit more intense or demanding , but when you re old , i suppose pleasures are more wise and simple .moreover , as time goes by , you can enjoy - maybe - your children , and grand children .that s a real advantage !joy comes from simple events : the visit of your family , a good meal all together , etc .on the other hand , you may have hard time when aging : diseases , loosing memories , etc .that s the big advantage of being young : generally , you re more fit , and moving around , doing sports is not a difficulty .but being busy all the day is not allways enjoying life : you can have multiple activities and spend most of your time unhappy about everything .to conclude , i would say that if enjoying life is having a full life , then young people enjoy life more than older do , but , if enjoying life is just being happy and taking care of yourself and other , then there s no age for enjoying everyday s life . ..
