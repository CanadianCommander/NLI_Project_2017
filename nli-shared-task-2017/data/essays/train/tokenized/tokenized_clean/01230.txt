in this eassy i m going to answer aquestion which is based on my experience about  should successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how ro do well  .and i will give my opinion whenther i agree or not with this statment and give some reasons and examples to support my opinion .will i think that successful people should alwasy try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do , because in order to succed in your life you have to try new things and take risks because it makes you learn more about your self and life , so for example , i have lived my whole life in saudi arabia a have lived there for about 18 years , and now after i finshed high school , i came to the united states to get my university degree there .so it was hard decision for me to make and it was also a risk to do that and also its anew thing for me , but it was a good decsion to make even if there was some riks but in order to succed in life a have do it , so now i am in whole diffrent culture than i was in , and i am learning new things and i have been in a lot og risks a tried alot of new things , but it was good for me .but it was good for me that i made this decision because i leared alot from it and if i did nt do it i wo nt succed in life , so if i just sated in my country and do that same things as i do i will not succed and learn new things .so in conclusion i just want to say that if u want to succed in life you have to always try new things and take risks in order to succed beacuse it maked u learn more and more about lifeso
