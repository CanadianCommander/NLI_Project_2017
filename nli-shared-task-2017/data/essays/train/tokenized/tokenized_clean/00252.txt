there are a lot of people all over the world to travel somewhre in a year .some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .however , i disagree with the thinking about traveling .i will write reasons next paragraphs .first , i want to go alone or my friends about my trip , because i da nt want to be led someone .i will buy guid book which we are going to go places .after that , we will be held meeting about traveling .on the other hands , if we would join a group , we will have to be led a tour guide , so we could not spend a great time .second , i do nt want to pay waste mony using a tour guide .a tour guide shows around somewhre as a job .therefore , money of traveling is included their payment .if we would go traveling somewhere by ourselves , we only pay our traveling money .third , i want to look many places by myself .i want to find hotels , restaurants and so on also .it is comfortable to use travel company .however , i think that it will be good memories prefer traveling alone or only with my friends to in a group .thus , i do nt consider that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i have some reasons about traveling .i do nt want to pay waste money , and i want to decide by myself .
