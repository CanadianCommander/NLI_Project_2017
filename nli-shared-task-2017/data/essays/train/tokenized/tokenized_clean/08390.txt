today young people give enough time to helping their communities .young people , thus , the new generation between twelve and thirty years old do their best to help their communities ; for instance , they organize several activities together : they visit old people on holidays , and bring them gifts and food .they give free private lessons to small children in their communities .they get involved in some youth clubs , and call writers , scientists , artists , musicians , or other people who have an impact on the society , to give a lecture in order to exchange some ideas with them .besides , at home they help their parents or other family members : they prepare the table , clean the house , wash the dishes . ..if a family member is ill , they visit this person .by working part-time , they also gather money for the poor in their community .they do all of these activities , as they study and work .sometimes they work part-time , because they want to contribute to the family budget .they buy their needs with the money they earned .with the rest of this money , they help the poor in their communities .however , many young students have to study hard to pass their extremely difficult exams , and get high marks .when they have exams , they may sit just concentrared on these exams , on reviewing the material that was presented them in class , or they may spend their time reading several scientific articles , or books .they study also for their communities , as they have to be distinguished members of the society in which they live .they study to learn and to help their communities .in their free time , of course , they assist the work of the older members of their communities ; for example , think about a twenty year old girl , studying biology : she studies when she has exams , papers to write , or has to make a class presentation ; if this girl is jewish , when the jewish new year , rosh ashanah , arrives , she will visit the poor of her community , and distribute food to the old poor people of the community ; these are the same things as what a christian girl does on christmas .young people are as helpful as the old ones .
