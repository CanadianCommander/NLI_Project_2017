i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .some people migh disagree of this opinion .for example , package of pharmaceutical or food products .these packages are defineded that there is explanation of the specific inoformation by fda .my friend is db ( diabetic disease ) , and she always checkes package of foods how much carbohydrate are contained in it .this information is the most important one for her .she doest care about design or picture or tv advertisements .however , i have an experience that one advertisement made product seems much better than it really is .for the hotel , their product is building and room and service .they want to ` sell  their room for customer , and they try to make their customer will be comfortable .the customer s satisfuction leads next ` sales  .i decided to go summer vacation with my friends when i was collage student .i checked book of travel to reserve a room at hotel .we tried to stay at expensive hotel because we would graduate after this vacation .so this vacation has special meaning for us .we found one picture .this hotel s building is europ style and also they have a lot of sports activity like a teniss or swimming pool etc .after we arrived that hotel , we realized the picture of hotel is no reflect what they are .any other customer does nt play tennis because this teniss court has a huge hole in the center .we spent a lot of money for thistherefore , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in fact , manu company spend a huge amount of money for advertisement to their sales will grow .
