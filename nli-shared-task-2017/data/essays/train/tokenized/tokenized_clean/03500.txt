in these days , lots of companies want from their employees to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .however , in my opinion , to specialize in one specific subject is better for peoples for some reasons .first of all , to specialize in one specific subject is good for a person .if a person only interested in one specific subject , he or she can focus in that subject carefully and he or she can know all of the details of that subject .he or she whoever study a specific subject will be an expert of his or her subject .second of all , if an employee in a big company have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects , the manager of that company can do out of work others employees because of the person who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .that is unemployment and it is not good for economy and employees .so everybody can do their job in the big companies .third of all , if a person wants to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it would be killing-time because that person can start their career in a company and he or she can start living real life a few years ago .to sum up , although lots of companies want from their workers to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects nowadays .because of these reasons such as focusing in one subject , employment , start to live real life a few years ago it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
