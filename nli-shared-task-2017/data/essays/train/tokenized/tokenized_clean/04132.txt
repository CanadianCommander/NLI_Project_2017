i totally agree with the opinion that if you want to become or stay successful in your life you have to try new things .a change in the way of working is not only good for leaders in the company , but also for the people working in the teams and working for you .if you try different ways to hit your target , you will be able to see different ways to reach your claim .that implicates also that you will be able to find different ways which can be different to your `` normal  way of working .and perhaps sometimes one of these newly found ways works out better for you and your whole company .if you include the people working for you in the different teams into the process of finding these new ways to work together and for each other , they will enjoy to be asked and will enjoy working for you even more and even better .you create a corporate identy and everyone will be happier because he has been asked for his opinion .he is a part of the company and knows that he is important for it and his chief .the change in the company , the results it brings and the new ways caused by it will show , what is good and what is bad for the daily working .it will take some time , but you will see the changes the new way brings .or if even the traditional way you worked before was and still is the better way .going back to the old way is allways possible .by searching for the best possibilities you gaine opportunities .you are allways able to decide for the best way for your company .that means , you are also able to go back to traditional ways and behaviours .a great chance !
