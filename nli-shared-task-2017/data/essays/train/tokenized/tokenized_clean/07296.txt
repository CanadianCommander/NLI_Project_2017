successful the word by itself describes people who does things taking risks i strongly agree that successful people certainly must have done things at risk rather than only doing what they already known i can support my statement with a couple of examples for instance sunitha and kalpana chawla the great two indians would certainly not be noticed in the indian history as they have been the two only indian women exploring into space if they had a thought of learning underneath and excelling in what they knew they might have certainly not been known to the world one can only excell in his knowledge by improving his own personal experiences but exploring out with risk will certainly find a way to him for succes all successful people should or might have certainly taken risk at one point or the other in the journey of success without out which it certainly be immpossibble .trying for new things will enable one self in discovering things and bring him to the stage of success .trying new things also makes oneself unique in the world and certainly they would have pride and a meaningful life lived .successful comes out primarily from the scientist experiment or invention .yes certainly the scientist without a risk would not have been successful with his work any individual to be successful should be dare enough to face the new aspects and try new things then he would certainly not miss the step of success .one can not have a satisfaction in his so called success without implementing certain new things if not that could only be for his self assesment .sucessful people like george bush and abdul kalam the presidents of america and india are known for there sucessful life they have tried upon new ammendments upon risk and could discover things .every individual is not all perfect enough one can make themselves perfect by doing things so certainly successful people try new things and take risks rather than do what they already knew and always put their heads high and taking risks will be the only aspect to be successful .
