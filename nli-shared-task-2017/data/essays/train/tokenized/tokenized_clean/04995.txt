i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .it is originated from the nature of the advertisement , the celebrities influence and weasal words in ads .the purpose of advertisement is to get you to buy the products .of course , advertiser will try their best to make the advertisements as appealing as possible .how to acchive that goal ?they will have to exaggerate the products , sometimes unintentionally .for example , certain vacuum machine claims that it will never lose grib of dirt on tv .we all know that it can not be true simply because all machines can not always perform the best with aging .additonally , commercials use celebritoes to add glamour to their products .everyday , we see paris hilton , jessica simpson and britney spears appearing on tv with perfect make-up and well-fit jeans .we might imagine if we use that makeup that we will look just like them .obviously , it is not true .not everyone has such a good face and such a sexy body , but the commercials mislead us to dream of that , those advertisements make the products seem so much better than they really are .finally , there are full of weasal words to fansinate customers , such as `` better  , `` younger  ,  faster  , `` more  , when a toothpaste advertisement says  we kill more oral germs than competitive brand does  .we have to ask `` how much more ?one more ?two more ?or in fact no more at all ?it can not be proved .it alwalys easier to talk the talking .similarily , when a car says it can run faster , we have to know what the car is faster than .a bike ?a scooter ?in conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to the nature of advertisement , the celebrities influence and weasal words .we have to use our own judgements to choose carefully something that is really good for us .do nt follow ads blindly .
