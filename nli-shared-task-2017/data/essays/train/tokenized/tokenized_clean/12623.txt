it is often accepted that young people enjoy life more than older people but i quite disagree with this view as it is merely associated with the concept of having no responsibility .indeed , the ways young and older people enjoy life can be very different and it has nothing to do with having responsibilities or not .as a matter of fact , young and older people have nt got access to the same activities as they often depend on your physical abilities .the fact that younger people are , most of the time , healthier than older people means that , for example , young people could enjoy playing a soccer match whereas old people could not .moreover , it would be harder for a senior to spend every night in clubs without sleeping .fortunately , enjoying life is not restricted to sport activities and older people could enjoy other aspects of life like building a family , creating business relationships , take part to the city or the country social or political life .these kind of activities can definitely bring a lot of happiness and maybe more fulfilling than simply play tennis or spending nights in bars .another important aspect is that older people may value life more as they might have been in contact with death of relatives .therefore , they might even enjoy life more than younger people as they know their time is limited .on the contrary , young people are not in direct contact with death and just do not realize what is at stake .they might then just live life as it comes and not get the most of it .as a conclusion , young people and older people can both enjoy life in different manners .happiness is not a question of age but of perspective and i am sure that anyone , young or old can enjoy life if they are ready for it .
