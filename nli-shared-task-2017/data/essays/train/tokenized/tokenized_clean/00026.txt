i agree that most advertisements make produces seem much better than they really are beceause most people accept them and companies that show their produces better than produces really are be benefited by this kinds od advertisements .the most important reason is that iit is necessary that advertisements have to present their produces better .the only way to raise their sales .for example , nowadays many on-line studying programes are offered on the internet .some adviertisements claim that if people take and finish some sorts of classes , they can get high salaries .however , is it ture ?i think some parts of them might true .the truth is that only few people who take these classes can get high salaries , while most people who take these classes can not be paid more money .second , althought most companies advertise their goods only on good way which they just mentain its advantages , they will not be panaltied .therefore , most adveritisements over tell cosumers their produces adventages .in fect , even though most people ultimately find the features of produces are not like these were said in the advertisements , most of them will not be anger with the companise .so , firms advertising their goods better than it really is have not any demerit .thrid , most people over rely on the produces  introdution of their advertisement and they do not pay attention to find what produces are their really factions .nonetheless , every businessman knew the weakness of human .so , when they try to promot a new produce , the only thing they have to do is think about how to let the ad looks better .for these three reason i thing most ads
