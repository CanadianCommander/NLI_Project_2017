people have different opinions on whether it is more important for students to understand idea or to learn facts .i strongly believe that it is more important for students to understand problem than it is for them to learn facts .first , students should learn accuratly about idea .second , deep problems are required understand to solve idea .let me explain in detail .to begin with , many students are expected to understand concepts from their teacher or schoool .teachers should have more responsible to teach for their children .let me show an example .if i have a hard time to study difficult math part , it is nessesary to solve time .but if i do not understand principle of that problem , i can not solve .that s because why i think more to understand idea than to learn facts .next , we should know cause and result solving problem
