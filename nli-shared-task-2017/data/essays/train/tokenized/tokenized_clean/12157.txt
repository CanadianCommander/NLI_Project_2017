i definitely do not agree with this statement .according to me , understanding ideas and learnig from facts have the same importance .let s take for example foreing language teaching .it is self-understandind that first of all is required a base , something a student can rely on to move in his `` foreing environnment  , for this reason teaching grammar , verbs , prepositions and so on is very important , but these things have to put into practice .this practice can not only be small speaches between students and teacher an between the students .in my experience , i ve always preferred to be alone , in a foret  ing country with no one around who speaks my same language .this is the only way to learn a foreing language the proper way , to put into practice what you learned in class .i can give another example ; some italian highschools that have the purpose to teach language as a second language , spend two over five years to teach grammar and the remaining three on literature .of course this is important , it s only through books you can deeply understand the way people think .but this is not enough , once an italian student finishes highschool , he is able to talk only about literature , sometimes he ai nt able neither to order a meal at the restaurant .this is the reason why i think foreing language teaching should be `` both-side  .on one of ` em you give students the basics , then you encourage ` em to use these teachings : maybe schools could organize periods when a student goes abroad to work an live , so he/she can really be able to rely on himself , and not only on his way of speaking .school has to be tha chance to grow , not only as a student , but also as men and women .this is the reason why i think understanding ideas and learning from facts have the same importance .
