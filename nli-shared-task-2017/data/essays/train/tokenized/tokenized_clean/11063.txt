i believe older people enjoy their life better than the young people .they have lived their life .the amount of experience they have is vast .they know the art of handling various situations .they live their life among friends .old people know the art of enjoying their life better than the young people .when they were young they amount of opportunities they had were more and the competition was less .they had fewer universities the amount of research that was happening in the field of science was limited .no matter the ground roots of scince and technology were kept during their time .the amount of tensions and the pressure they had to deal was less .i can say this because of the numerous old people that i have spoken to including my own grand parents .whenever i talk to them i gather so much of information that i have to say yes `` the world is not enough  .they use to have some problems here and there but during their time the community use to stand as one .they laugh they share the life time achievements .like my grandfather talks about the worldwar ii .how my grand mother waited for him , and use to pray in church everyday for his well being .young people on the other hand are more complex of a nature i would say .they amount of competition that they have to face every day .somebody or the other is trying to proove himself better than the other .these factors lead to tensions , enormous pressure at times and frustration as well .generally younger generation is least conecrned of getting involved in community activities , other then once in a while .some times we never who is our next door neighbour .as we the younger generation is more concerned with the privacy .we are not ready to accept somebody s help .we want to remain confined within ourselves .the young generation might be seen speaking once in a while in community here and there .they generally are forgetting the natural art of enjoying .enjoyment could be going to clubs and bars have some drinks and have fun and come back .therefore in my opinion it is the old people who know the real art of enjoyment .young generation should take sometime off their busy schedule and spend time with the old people .we might share love and affection with them and in return gain a lot out of them .
