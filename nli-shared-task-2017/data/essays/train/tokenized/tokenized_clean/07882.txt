some people assert that learning broad knowledge of many academic subfects is more important than learing one specific subject .others think that specializing in one subject is better .i think that it is better to know broad knowledge than study only one subject .i agree with the importance of specialing one topic , but we have already know very detail by using internet , so i think that knowing many things is more important for living in the furure than studying one subject and show some benefits about it .first , people can spread their vision through learning many subjects .if people study only one subject , their way fo thinking or vision must be narrow .today , so many problems in the world , and they are inter-relating complexly .for example , when he/she think about global warming , he/she have to look at economical , social , biological issues , so people must know and think about it by many visions .moreover , this example shows not only environmental problems , but also business or political issues , because some cases are as complex as environmenal problems .therefore , building a lot of visions is very important .another benefit of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that which skill is very important for taking leadership .today , leader have to know many things more than general people .for being respected and dependad on leader , people have to know wide knowledge , and solve difficult problems .if leader do not know very detail or specific data , i think that it is no problem , because they could ask each specialists .then , the most important skill of working as a leader is choosing or finding best way to solve the problem .for example , when thier partner wants to ask him why my work do not becoming well , if leaders who know only one thing deepy , they can answer about just his subject , but if leaders who know many subjects , they could advise partner by using many knowledge .in conclusion , there are two main benefits of having wide knowledge , which are able to spread many visions and able to be a reliable leader in the future .therefore , if you work in the company or goverment as a leader , you have to learn not only one issue , but a lot of subjects .
