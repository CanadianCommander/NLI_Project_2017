i am agree with the statement .the facts will be when you go to work .it s very important when you go to school or in the university understand and learn the concepts , theories and ideas .this is the base to understend your future work .the ideas will be to help you .i study architeture to the politecnic of milan , an important universty in the north italy .often i think is better to go now to work , why sometimes i m boring to study , and i thinks that these i study is not so important for my work .but my father always tell me that is very important have the concept s base of your work [ for instance the history of the monuments , sociologie , the tehories of the construction ] .it s true .sometimes i go with my father [ he is an engeeniers ] to see the built in construction .so i can understand that all the thinks that i study to the university , i really find in the reality .the big problem of this statement is when you is 15-16 years .these years are very important for the future , because you have to decide what do you want in the life , what work do you prefere .when i was 15 i didn-t like study .i prefered other thinks .in this years you are not interested for your future , you prefere go out with friends , play music or soccer , have a good car , have a nice holiday , ...the study is the last thinks that you have in the brain .altough you are
