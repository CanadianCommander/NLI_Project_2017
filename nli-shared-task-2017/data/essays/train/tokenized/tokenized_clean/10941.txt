`` successful people try to new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  , i agree with this statement because that the person can not get success without doing new things .if he do the same thing that already done there is no anything special between the others and the successfull person .i strongly agrre with this statement .example in our country there is one successfull person in the bussiness that he created many revolutions in the bussiness system .he is the one of the gretest person s in our country .he use to do the new things istead of doing the same things .he started with small firm and developed many types of products , he was not satisfied with the bussiness with the same products he strated many types of bussiness in different feilds and established a big group of companies .he is very successful person in that feild eventhough he was ot satisfied with that .he use to invent new one and start that firm , with that capability he started many small products and became a successfull person .he started many firms in all feilds like in the feild cell phones , petro chemicals , cotton firms and finance groups and got success .he is not satisfied with that same bussiness he wants to invent somany things mean the new things by that he became a successful person .he also took somany risks to get succeed .i conclude that it is correct statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well  .by using the above examples i can state that the person should have guts to start the bussiness in other feild rather than in the same feild he known well , it is also a risk to do new things but eventhough they know it is risk they use to do the new things that is the successfull person s secret to success in life .
