i agree with the statement : usually advestisements make products seem much better than they really are .i also think that in many cases this beviour is an illegal way to send a product to normal people .in fact , many times advertisements involve situations that are bild to hit particular groups of people , like children or old persons .children are one of the favourite targets for advertisements , because they want to be socially accepted by other children and usually this means that they want clothes , games and other things similar to those that the others have .parents know that many of those things do nt correspond to real desires of their sons , but they ca nt say ` no  in front of many requests , because it is very important to be accepted by the other children .for this reason , many advertisements are prepared for children and they usually show products that are nt good as it seems in television , or on a newspaper .an example are toys : in italy , many years ago , a very important company started selling electronic games , by mail .in television they showed a particular product , that was nice and interesting , and many families bougth it .the problem started when families recived it by mail : the game was nt the one they had seen on television , it was shorter and very difficult to be played .also old peolple are good targets for fake advertisements , because they are weak and unable to realize what they are going to buy .an example : my grandmother bougth a radio , that she had seen on a newspaper , and when she recived it , by mail , she realized that it did nt work .
