there are no question that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .ther are tow major reasons : my experiences and famous studies .to begin with , i used to use internet shopping mall because i thought that it could save time and energy .however , i spent more time and energy than i went shopping to stores .when i bought somethings i relied on only advertisements .products always looked good in advertisement so i paid for that .however , when i recieved product i always disappointed .real product were very different from advertisements .as a result , i had to request money back .now i do not use internet shopping mall .moreover , according to the studies , those who make product use computer and special things to their products in order to look good .they say that people who buy their products do not realize different things and even though they realize this the percent of money back is very low .since these reasons those who make product try to look better in advertisement than real .in sum up with , according to the my experience and studies , most advertisemensts make products semm much better than really are .
