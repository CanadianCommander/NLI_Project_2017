on yesterday newspaper i read about an article that talked about the knowledge in academic subjects .that article contained an interview made to some people of my town ; lots of them believed that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; however some people thought that is better to specialize in a specific subject .the first ones said that knowing things from different field gives you more chances to get a job .for example , in a company you would be able to cover various parts and so you would become very important for your boss because he could use you for everything he needs .in addition , in daily life you could be helpful to the others and sometimes you would nt need to call a specialized person to solve a matter because you are able to do it .the last thing , knowing a lot of different thinks makes your brain use to work in different ways .like i said before , a second group of people is not still convinced about this theory .at the interview time , they said that is better to specialize in a specific subject because this will bring you to know things better than others .for example , you will be more competitive with your job , and you will be more sure to keep your work place because nobody will know the subject like you .moreover , we can say that some of very important jobs ( like the medical or the engineer ) require you to specialize just in that field to learn your job well , because that ones are so difficult fields .i ve read the article with interest but i have nt changed my idea about this topic .in my life i have always tried to go inside subjects that belonged to different fields ; however i know that somebody would nt be agree with me because thinks that i will never arrive anywhere with this mentality .i still think that it s better to have knowledge of many academics topics because i believe that this street will bring me to be successful .behaving like this i m sure that i will not have regrets in future .
