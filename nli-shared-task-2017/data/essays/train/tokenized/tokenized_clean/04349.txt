people should take risks and try new things , to be successful .life does not gives us a list full of opportunities .we must create our own chances .as we look through history , we can understand that every succesful person did something new .scientists who discovers incredible things or artists who thinks more creative are called `` successful  in our time .the thing which make kandinsky or picasso is that , these people tried new things .they were not afraid to create `` cubism  or the other art technics .the leaders such as martin luther king or ataturk , battled even if it seems impossible .victory can not be won without taking risks .there are so many examples to give , our own lives are also examples .for example , at school i asked a question about a murder which had happened in my country .it was such a question that should not be asked but everybody knows about .it was a new thing , to ask about politics and talk about them in class .that question created me a new job opportunity , when a modern professeur heard about it .i learned that , we should not be afraid to ask , to search and to judge because it is the only way to win .in every novel or in every movie , there is a hero who makes everything better for himself or others by taking risks .last night i watched a movie called `` pursuit of happiness  which depends on a real story .in the movie there was a man who has no money and a 5 year old kid .he turned from an unknown person to a world wide hero .after all , i can say that , people should try new things and take risks .it is the only way to be successful .otherwise , they may not have the life that they want to live .
