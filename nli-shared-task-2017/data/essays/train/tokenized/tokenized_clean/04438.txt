take the risk !it is an one of the rules in guiding the way to success .it has always been that successful people have been noted as risk-takers when they face a critical cross in the lives .they try new things instead of doing only things that they already know .trying new things will not always lead into loses or disappointments .on the contrary , it sometimes lead to new paths , and great brand new results .it is in fact the way behind most of the discoveries and inventions of the human race .for example , christopher colombus was so persistent in running after his dream of sailing into the east through the altantic ocean , and not through africa to the indian ocean .after he got his nessecary funding , he took the risk of shipping into the atlantic ocean , though many people thought that earth was flat , and then eventually , he and his ships will fall down to to the bottom of hell .but , his out-of-the-box thought led him to discover the americas .in fact , he tried sailing to the east , and he reached a land that he thought was india , but it was not .his discovery has changed the whole world and humanity .moreover , it proved that the earth is not flat , but rounded shape .in conclusion , we have seen that successful people did not do what they already know to do well , but they take risks that led them to the glory of success .
