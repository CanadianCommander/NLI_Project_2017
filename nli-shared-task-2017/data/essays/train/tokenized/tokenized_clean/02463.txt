i agree with the statement that , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in this essay i will present a variety of reasons and examples that support my conviction .the very purpose of an advertisement is to maximize sales of a particular product .to maximize sales it is imperative to convince people to buy the product and make the product appear much better than it is .advertisements highlight the good points of a particular product while neglecting to mention its  bad points .advertisements for new drugs , for instance , often highlight how a particular drug can cure a certain disease while neglecting to mention any side effects that may occur as a result of using that drug .some advertisements advertise qualities of the product that are unlikely to be of much use .however , people may be encouraged to buy the product .for example , many car advertisements advertise the top speed of car - but who is going to drive a car at 300 km/per hour ?other advertisements portray products as they would function under ideal conditions , without describing how they would function under conditions of common use .for instance , advertisements for mobile phones and other technological items suggest that they can function perfectly for an indefinite time period .this does not , of course consider the effect of normal wear and tear and entices people to buy them .the cleverest and often the most successful advertisements make use of subtle psychological tricks to encourage people to buy products .they do this by ascribing attributes to the product that it may , in fact , lack .advertisements for cigarettes are a classic example .cigarette users are depicted as fashionable and popular as opposed to those who do not use cigarettes .no company mentioned the harms of cigarettes until government regulations forced them to do so .deodorant advertisements are another example , often suggesting that the male user of a particular deodorant would have women following him left , right and centre !to conclude then , advertisements aim to maximize sales of products by making them seem much better than they really are .they do this in a variety of ways - examples of which i have given in the above essay .
