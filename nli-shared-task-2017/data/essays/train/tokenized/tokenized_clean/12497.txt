some poeple think young people enjoy more than old people in life , so do i. old people know the value of life .they have a lot of experiences .they know that when they enjoy with life , they lose somethings .but , young people can not know they will be loser , when they begin to enjoy with life .to me , all people enjoy life when they are young .because , young people neither know , nor consider value of life .for instance , in turkey all young people go to the parties , at all .they spend their time on fun .if you go to a club in turkey , you can see young people , but you can not see older people .in addition to this example , older people prefer to rest , rather than to go to enjoy .for instance , in here , old people become retired when they spend a lot of years to work .after that , they are usually found , or seen at their houses .because they find their houses more comfortable than out of home .but young people use different method , when they are tired .for instance , in my university , there are parties at the end of all semesters .all students at the university are found at these parties .on the other example , young people do nt want to be their houses , when they are tired or angry to anything .i usually drive my car , when i am not happy .i like to do speed with my car .if i become my house during bad time , i become worse .finally , young people spend more time to enjoy than older people .because , when people are young they do nt know that they will be loser when they spend time on fun , rather than on studying , or on working .that is to say , people learn the value of life from youngster to oldster .when young people become old people , they start to spend less time on fun than before .
