with respect to the given topic , i competely agree that it is better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i feel that these when technology and trends are fast changing , a person should be well aware of all the things that are going on in the society today .these days when science and technology is changing by leaps and bounds and everything being unpredictable one should always be ready to face anything he encounters .a person should be flexible with his knowledge and should be ready to do everything that the present day needs .having a knowledge of many academic subjects makes him flexible and a person can shift to any other subject that is in demand .for example , oil ang gas has been of great importance and demand for various uses say automobiles .these have been used for quite a long time but now the market has changed , scientists have discovered alternative sources of energy like fuel cells , bio - diesel etc .many students prefer to study and work in developed countries like the us or the uk because of their educational system which is flexible and helps them choose whatever subject they prefer .specializing in one academic subject constrains a person to stick to only a single subject which may or may not be a choice or use of tomorrow .whereas on the other hand when a person has a broad knowledge of many academic subject he or she would be able to get into a subject that is in demand or would come in demand .i would like to it is better to be a fish in the ocean rather than to be a fish in a well which thinks that the world is just the well around it .the world is fast changing and everyone should be ready to go along with .
