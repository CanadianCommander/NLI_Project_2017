all over the world , if we examine the present and past , there is two kind of person , one who serves their life in the known ways , just simply survives and the extreme ones who make new things try to find new ways and takes risks which can not be taken .i am totaly agree that successful people are the ones that who try the new and take risks even if i can not be taken before .firstly , success is something like not to be done by everyone , in opposite you can say that reading is a success , but nowadays it is not because everybody can read .in that point it might be a good example to give the wright brothers flying expriences , 100 years before they tried to fly , and they took the biggest risk which can be caused by death .they were successful inventors .and i think that is the meaning of success .after that i can be known that the times that risks are taken might be the break down of the history , and if you dont take the risk you can not survive .in the history , there is certain times that whole future is in the hands of a human being .one can not say that the risk of hannibal to pass tha alpines ( the mountain above the italy ) in the middle of the winter was not a risk , but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of italy to rome .he was a successful soldier .sometimes if you dont take risks you can not survive .finally , trying new things is one of the most strong way to be successful .the other ways done by lots of people lots of time and you can see that they all not did anything new .for example , the great experimental physicist m. faraday , try the new way of understanding the unknown area , and until he was shown on the scene it might be tried these experiments over hundred times .of course he is a successful man because he tried the new and think the new .all in all , the whole world is turning over the successful persons hands , and if you tried to look up their most attracted works they tried the new , they take the risk .
