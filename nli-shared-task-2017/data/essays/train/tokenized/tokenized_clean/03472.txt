for many companies it is very important to make advertisement .for example a cigaratte company has a product which has a really small difference to a cigarette of an other company .so people buy this label because of the emotional link between them and the cigarette .the goal in this essay is to show that the products in the advertisement seems to be better than they really are .one possiblity ist that the company tries to create a situations in which we prefer their product .for example a person after doing sport is thirsty .so a coke would be the best solution for the problem of this person .we can feel with this person because we remember how the feeling is if you are thirsty .to enjoy a coke then is a very good feeling , so the simple product seems as something very important .in addition often the products are in a very good light .a pullover for example looks very coulurful or a chocolat bar looks very tasty .this gives the impression that this product is really good .moreover the producer works sometimes with the desires of the costumers .this means for example a man , who would like to be attractive , has the impression that an axe deodorant must be a perfect product for him , because if he uses the deodorant every woman will follow him .so this product seems for the man better than it really is .to conclude this arguments , you can say that there are many diffrent ways of manipulate a person and their decision .the target of the companies is to win new costumers .so we should be critical to this form of influence .it is very important to think clear and logical if you buy something .
