i agree with the idea `` it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are some reasons for this .firstly , understanding ideas and concepts is an abstract process .namely , they are the things which are difficult to learn or understand for the students .so , if they are learned by the students the students would be one step further in the teaching and the learning atmosphere .for example , love is a concept .students can love their mother , father , or friends .this is a easy thing to do .however , their understanding of the love concept takes some time .it is more difficult than loving someone .moreover , being realistic is an idea .maybe , in their daily lives students can be realistic , however , learning the idea of being realistic is more difficult than being realistic .so , it is more important for the students to learn the ideas and concepts .secondly , the facts can change in time .moreover , some facts can change person to person .for example , the fact that the world is flat changed today .another example is , there are some rituals in some cultures .namely there are some culture specific facts .for example , according to the culture of turkey people cry when a person dies .this is a fact in my country .however , in indian culture people never cry for the death person .they think that the death person is saved from his/her agonies in their lives .namely , a fact can change from culture to culture so , learning all the facts are not always useful to the students .as a result , as the understanding the facts are easy and the need for learning the facts changes from person to person , understanding ideas and concepts is more important , as it is more essential for the students than the other .
