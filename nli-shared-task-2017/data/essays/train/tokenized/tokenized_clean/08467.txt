i agree with this statement .successful people really know about themselves .they know what they really good at , so they do nt try for new things that taking them into the risks .it is very different between successful people and unsuccessful people .successful people work hard on their certain thing .for example , if a person is an expert in graphic design , that person should work hard on something that relates to graphic design .that is easy way to succeed .this is because a person know almost everything about graphic design .however if that person works in electric company , do you know what will happened ?a person will fail with that job .this is because that person only knows about graphic design , not electric matters .it is very risky that a person does nt know nothing about new things .so successful people do nt try new thing that causes risks .how about unsucessful people .whenever they suceed something , they fell they can do whatever they want .so they try to start new job that they do nt really know about it .that is very risky .however , unsucessful people do nt realize until they are failing with that job .it is too late !they must realize before starting new job .whnever they realize , they have a lot of money to recompense and sometimes those people are going to suicide .that is very fool thing to do .the life is very precious and people should nt waste it .no one forgives those people even the god .now we know how different between successful people and unsuccessful people .they are same human but they are so different in inside of their minds .so to be successful .do nt try new things and work hard on whatever you are experts in .
