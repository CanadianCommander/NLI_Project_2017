idea over factthe concepts and ideas that are essential in the learning procees of any academic proffesion have to understand , and not memorized .the learning process implies a thought , ration , and analysis ; all of them essential in the absorption of information into our brains .i agree with this statement because the understanding of all those concepts will beter prepare me in my proffesion .i believe that the facts come as a direct result of the concepts and ideas that are learned in the academic prepation for a career .we would not have facts if it was not for especific sciences like mathematics , chemistry , and physics .a fact is only a series of numbers of a certain event or people .that are thrown by the person that does the recolection process of information to do statistics .with out the process of understanding the concepts and ideas of a science we would not be able to create facts .for example we could be able to count or do statistics without mathematics .another perspective of facts is that we do not know if the facts are true or not ; the facts can be manipulated by personal or monetary interest .for example a pharmaceutical company may manipulate facts of a certain disease - to increase sales of the medicine that cures that particular disease - to create a highers revenues on the financial statements .i am not saying that facts are not important .i use facts all the time in my profession and job .but , we do not have to make facts the foundation of our knowledge in this world .a fact when it is given as an honestly , errorless , and doubtless source , it wil automatically become a most useful tool in our day-to-day life .the better understanding of ideas and concepts will make better facts and staticstics in the near future .
