in the industralized world , it is a common practice to advertise different products in order to generate as much profit as possible .this method is used in different ways like television , internet , newspapers and magazines .a close look at these advertisements will unveil the negative effect that they have on the consumer .as a matter of fact , most advertisements are based on profit making .the products are shown by their advertisors as the ultimate solution for a problem .for example , a detergent company may resort to showing the negative effects of using another material and suggest the use of their product .this logic is not based on a scientific approach .it stems from a an irrational and inhuman desire in profit .to make things worse , some companies would not even advertise the real product .instead , they only display a sample and sell a completely different type of product later .therefore , this method pushes customers to be more aware of advertisements .another factor that explains why products are not shown as they actually appear in reality is the ineffectiveness of the product itself .for instance , in the car industry , any advertisement of any car will ensure the buyer of the reliable vehicle , but reports made by different consumer agencies have shown the misleading ways that the advertisement relies upon .the company , for example , will not stress the importance of the engine , but they will show the luxurious interior of the car .as a result , consumers are trapped between what s real and what s not .a lot of people lose their money because of what they saw on television and a lot of warnings of those misleading ads have been shown .also several courts legal agencies hve long debated whether companies should not lie in those promotional messages that they support .to conclude , consumers should not take advertisements as they are .a more rational approach to propaganda should be adopted .i consider much of the advertising companies an obstacle in face of the true human progress .
