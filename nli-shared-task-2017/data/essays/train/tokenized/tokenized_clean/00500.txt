i completely agree on the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing the things they are already proficient at .there are many great scientists , politicians , poets who are considered very sucessful by our society .if they have not tried new ideas they would not have been so popular .for ex : if professor einstein would not have thought of new theories in physics , we wouldnt be studying the einsteins law s of energy today .great discoveries only happen when the people take chance and risk .for ex : columbus discovered america just by exploring new routes across the oceans .many inventions like the newton s law s of motion were discovered very accidentally , when newton threw a apple into the sky and observed the outcome .also for ex : many live saving anti-cancer drugs would not have been in the market , if the pharmaceutical companies have not taken a chance and invested in them .trying new things and taking calculated risks brings in technologies .for ex : i-pod is one good innovation of apple .every person who loves music carries an i-pod .had the apple industry been so apprehensive about the market of their new product without actually placing it in the market they would not have been so successful .taking chances and trying innovative things improves the life and brings in enthusiasm in every person s life .for ex : one of my friend has never tried hiking , i have encouraged her to come with me for hiking .she started to like hiking once she started doing it .to summarize , people should think creatively out of their shell and take risks which will improve their personality as a whole and which benefit the nation .
