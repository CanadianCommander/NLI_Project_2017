i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .first of all i can have idea for a lot of thing .if you specialize in one specific subject you can only talk about it .hovever if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can talk about a lot of things .i want to have idea for a lot of academic subject always .when i was in secondary school i have a teacher who have idea for everything .i want to be like him .he was also the most popular teacher in my school .all of the students love him and also all of the teachers love him .may be this is the most important reason having broad knowledge of many academic subject for me .also i have lots of reason for it .i want to be a person who can talk everything .some people can say to specialize one subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .may be it is good for talking your special subject but the others ?you can not say any about other subjects .for example in my university there are lots of profesor can not say anyting about other academic subjects .most of my friend do nt want to be profesor because of this reason .they think if you specialize in one specific subject you can not say any about other subjects .i want to explain my idea about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing one specific subject .also having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better for me .if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can talk about a lot of things .do nt you want to be perfect ?
