i think that concepts are colse to the idea of model and system .facts are close to the idea of operations .in this way , i think for students is more important to learn how models and system work than to have a detailed knowledge of the operations or facts .probably we can use an example to better explain my opinion .for istance a student could know everything concerning art hystory : the art movements , the life of the main artists , chronological facts .this knowlege is an important base to start a career as an artist but it is not sufficient .i mean that to be a good artist the student should learn and understand the logic and the principles , important to produce creativity and art .if the student s intention si to become a painter , he need to understand the color system , the concept of composition , the rules how to evoke emotions and how to capture viewer s attention .i think that we can also use another example to present this point of view .schopenauer , the philosopher , said that it is not important to read the newspaper everyday in order to undesrtand the world , as well as it not imporatnt to read avery second on your watch to check the time .in my opinion this is a brilliant example of the importance of synthesis and learning .facts are important to shape the reality , facts are also important as background for our learning .on the other hand , ideas and concepts are important to create debates , new thoughts , new innovation and creativity .even if inspired by classic rules , ideas for example were at the base of the renessaice , a movemnet wich means re-birth .so , facts are mainly importnat to help students in finding the concepts behind them .so fact are an iportnt sorces of information and inspiration but ideas are the key ingredients able to move the world and mankind ahed .
