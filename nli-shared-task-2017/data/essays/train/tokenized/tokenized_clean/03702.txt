i totally agree with this idea .this statement is an summary of all scientist , explorers etc .i think this statement has something to do with personal values .some people are ready to use sth which someone else has already did it or worked on it .these kinds of people think that they are very clever .is it really so ?in the short term , they are succesful .but in the long term , they are not .what happens is they can not improve themselves for the future .there is saying `` education or training goes on through our lifetime  .everybody has to do sth at a definite period of his/her life .if we want to be successful at the end , we must keep trying and taking risks .that brings to a conlusion that in our life there are things we can learn from our family members , teachers in the school and there are things we need to learn by ourselves .those who do not try and take risk , they can never learn anything new .so , in our society , there becomes a group of people at the same level of information .by the time , people who try new things and take risk train themselves .at the beginning of my essay , i mentioned that trying is personal way of life .personally i always try new things even though there is a risk to fail .after 20 years , i see those people not taking risks are at the same level of their life .they always need somebody to teach them .i n our daily life we say experiment , experiment . ..this is a tool for scientific developments .if we look at those scientist lived in the past , they did not innovate or discover sth at their firts attempt .it requires lots of time to reach a conlusion on spesific subject .let s look at the human life .in the old days , man were living in a very bad and poor conditions .years and years after , man is exploring life out of our earth .how did we manage to come to a level like this ?by trying , taking risk .to fly in the air , many people have been sacrificed .
