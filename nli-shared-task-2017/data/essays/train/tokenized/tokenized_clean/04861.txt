i agree with young peole enjoy more than older people do .there are two reasons why i agree with that statement .firstly , young people are healthier and younger than older people .for example , my grandmother loves to travle around the world .however , she can not do right now because of her health .she used to tell me that she travels a lot .she found the joyness and purpose of bieng alive from meeting new people and learning otherthings that she could not experience before .i think if she was healthier and younger like me .it would be better to enjoy her life .in my age , i can go anywhere i want to because i am heathy and young .i can actually enjoy my life doing whatever i want to .i think that health is big part of one of reasons .secondly , there are many entertainments for younger people but not for adults i guess .in korea , where is my home country , there are many fun things to do for young ages such as clubbing , playing game , singing songs in karayoke , taking sticker pictures with friends , and dating with boyfriends or girlfriends .i am not saying that older people can not date each other .however , there are not that many things for adults like old people .they might go to drink or watch movies very sometimes but that is not always fun and joyable .i think that there are more entertainments for younger ages than older ages .in conclusion , i agree with young people enjoy more than older people do .there are two reasons that i mentioned before .for enjoing life , portion of health requires a lot and i think that is the most important opinion for this statement .another reason is that there are many entertaints for younger people rather than older people .
