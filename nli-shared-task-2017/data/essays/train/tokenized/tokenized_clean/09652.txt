from my perspective , i do agree with the concept of young people nowaways do not give enough time to helping their communities .the reason why i have a strong feeling towards it is because that for the past four years i have been helping at the orphanage constantly , but i seldom find any other young adult like me who is willing to take part of their time off in a week or a month to help out those who are in needs .maybe i am being too harsh on my peers for asking them to give something back for their community , but somehow i start seeing my country , taiwan , has becoming a place with cold-hearded younger generations .since i am a person who walks between the two worlds , the united states and taiwan , i share my equal halves on both of my homes .i often sign up community survives with my peers in the states to just more or less make our community better , and to provide some care and love for the people who really need it .most importantly , i feel happiness around , and some senses of having a meaningful life .i even see more young adults in the states are willing to help out their community by doing any kind of service .maybe that is why the states is still growing as a steadlily country , and this is something that my chinese folks will never understand .there might be some factors for causing this kind of tragedy .students here are still being punished with corperal punishments , and their teachers always brainwash them by telling them that school and grades come first , and nothing else is far more important than academics .maybe therefore kids stop concerning about what they should actually be caring about .the outside world is no longer a huge impact on their life besides schooling .i think this is one of the major problems which drag young people to become less prone to serving back their communities .what we need in the society now is someone who has broader horizon , and audacious enough to show some passions to encourage our young people to once be able to provide some time to help out their communities .sometimes i do feel it is a posterous thing to realize that there are less people who are willing to assist their communities , but i certainly do understand that it is because of the surrounding people are living in , with pressure and income difficulties , that they can not even have a time to rest and think about the things that will bring love and happiness to other people and their further generations .
