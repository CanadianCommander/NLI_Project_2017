in following text i m going to express my thoughts about the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know .there is a distinction of successful people that i want to make before answering the question .there are two kinds of them .first is the successful guy , who just happened to be in the right spot or have the right friend to come into a position where he is successfull .those people mostz do nt try new things at all or use new knowledge .they ll be interested in keeping the current status quo .the second kind are the self-made successful people .they do have to take risks and think new thoughts in order to be successful .for example if you open a shop , you ll have to get a loan from a bank , which is risky because you might ca nt pay it back .if you are not able to pay your rates you risk not only the new shop you ve opened , but your whole existance .therefore you have to make sure that your bussines is going to work .the best way to be successful is to differ from others .you ll have to think about new products to sell , new ways to advertise them .maybe new locations and ways to build them .without innovation it wo nt take long until there is someone better coming into the field , to take your custumers away .that s why , as a self-made man , you always have to be on top of new developments .whether in technical or in marketing issues .that does nt mean that in order to be successful you ll have to start something totally new .it s perfectly possible to start with something that you already know and are good at .but it s a must to always develop new skills and knowledge .custumers always want the best service they can get so you have to improve your service .once you re successfull , ther is no guaranty that it always stays like that .successful people will always make efforts to improve further .it s neccesary for them to take risks and think new thoughts .
