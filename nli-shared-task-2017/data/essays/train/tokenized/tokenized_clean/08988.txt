do successful people willing to try new things and take risks ?the answer is concerned to be negative , but i totally agree the point of view .there are three reasons of my opinion presented as followed .first , it is the adventurous spirit that successful people usually have .it is easier to learn new knowledges by asking a lot of question .in addition , it offers more opportunities for them to grasp something new by asking questions or reading lots of books .how to make things they already know more perfect and convenient are the priority thing to them .second , it is the special view that the successful people take with .different from the others , they look things in the long run but not just a short term .they consider things not only from one single aspect but also from many points of views in the future .that can actually make sure for their success life .third , it is the unsatisifing with what they already know how to do well make them eager to find more difficult challenges to complete .the more difficulty of the challenge , the more they want .challenging hard thingto sum up , i think successful people are willing to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reasons , among them by having the adventurous spirit , special points of view , and always not satisfing with what they have .
