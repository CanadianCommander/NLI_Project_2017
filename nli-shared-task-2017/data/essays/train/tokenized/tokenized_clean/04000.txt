there are some reasons to agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first , tour guide have knowledge for travel place .tour guide can introduce important part of travel place and important object .for example , our family went to new york , in 2004 .that time , we did nt have a tour guide .first time , we feel ok .when we leave that country , we do nt have some knowledge of that country .we feel very bad .but tour guide cover this kind of thing .secondly , tour guide give safety .other country have different people , different society and different place .if we have no tour guide , we can lost the way or dangerous from other people .for example , i see atricle of newspaper .that article s story is dangerous of sole travel .in that artical there are two students .two students enjoy their travel .but last day , one student goes to some place .that student lostes the way .suddenly , gangster kidnaps that student .people ca nt finds that student .tow months later , that student s parent finds that student in other city .that student seats some place .that student looks like bulge .when parent find student , that student has no leg and arms .gangster cut them and threat him .this kind of article give very important thing of tour guide .tour guide can cover this kind of action .thirdly , we can meet mane people in group led .we lives in common community .and we can make friends or helpful people .when we need some help , we can need some help from guide and group people .consquently , i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
