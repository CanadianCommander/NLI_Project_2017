i agree that most advertisements make products seem there are really are .i had many experiences in this situation because the product seems very good in the advertisements .there are three reasons to support my opinion .firstly , people make an advertisement in order to catch coustomers  eyes , so it will talk about that it s good for you when you choose to use it .after people saw the advertisement , they would like to buy it in order to know ot is good or not .sometime people will feel bad with it .secondly , the companies make products and they always hope that they can earn somme money by selling it .they will let coustomers think that it s a worth to buy , so they will talking it s benifits in the advertisements .for example , when they introduce a cookies , they might tell you it use honey not suger and they add the natural produce in the cookies .it is good for your health and mind .it also taste delicious .people will be attacted and would like to try it .furthermore , the companies will invite a professional people to be the actor to introduce the products in the advertisements .it seems that it is a good direction to buy the products .some people will believe it because it is introduced by a famous people .to sum up , i believe that most advertisement make products seem there are .it is a business to catch people  eyes .nowaday , even we know the reason , we still would kike to buy the products and try to use it .some of them are really , some do nt .people should get more informatin befort you buy a product and then you can find a useful things for yourself .
