car usage gets larger and larger in time being but in my opinion in twenty years there will be less cars in use that there are today .there are several reasons why i think so .first of all cars consume fuel oil while working , this will became the main restriction of car usage in twenty years since the price of fuel oil gets higher due to lack of founding it around the world .moreover , usage of fuel oil causes environmental pollution due to the carbonmonoxides provided after fuel gas usage .even if some people believe that there will be a solution of this problem with new energy sources like natural gases since it will affect the performance of the car i think natural gas usage wo nt be preffered by users .the second main problem with car usage will be the lack of parking places around the world .if the number of cars gets larget the people will not found places to park them and would preffer to travel with something else for example buses insead of individual cars .third the recovery of cars gets expensive and harder in time being .since solid waste aroun the world becomes a bigger problem in time being production of solid waste will be tried to reduced expecially by goverments .this situation will cause highering the taxes of cars and this will affect the car owners badly .as a result people will not prefer to buy a car .fourth and last i think that technology will improve in twenty years such that there will be new and usable transport vehicles around the world used insted of cars like smalll personal planes etc .this will cause a reduction of car need .to sum up , in my opinion expenses of car usage , environmental problems that car usage cause and developing alternatives to the cars with improved technology will cause a reduction in car usage in twenty years .
