recent days my parents often ask me , `` so , what do you want to study in an university ?whenever this question stands in front of me , i ca nt even say a ward to answer it , but instead just stand there deligently and deeply considering what i really want to learn for endless time .in some of the universities , they do nt ask to choose major but they give an oppotunity for students to take any subjects they want to .however i do nt want belong to it .i personally think that the knowing and specializing in one specific subject is much important because there are a lot of disadvantages of trying to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects .firstly , it is impossible to put all knowledge in the world in people s small brain in such a short amount of life that we have given .human s history is surprisingly long , and every new facts and information were found by people at that time .besides information and knowledge are always changing and increasing as time passes by .as a result , the sum of those knowledge , which were found and will be found , are a lot and anybody ca nt input them in the brain less than a decade we got .furthermore , there are a lot of people who ca nt get job that they expect and become a unemployment .one of the reason of this is because they have spread their views too wide and have nt focused on what they can really good at .even though they have broad knowledge , but it ll be useless when it comes to reality since when people are getting job , they have to specialize what the specific job they work for .to conclude , i believe that specializign in one specific subject is considerabely essential for people s life since knowing as much as they can on many academic subjects is impossible .nobody is good at every subjects , however it is true that everybody has certain subject that they can do better than others do .
