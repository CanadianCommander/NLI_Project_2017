some people say successful people try new things and take risks .it is true because when a person start to do new things he/she can keep attention from the others which helps to keep him/her high motivation , make own rules instead keep trucking somebody s old theory , and also have more chances to be a successful person .first , when a person starts the new things usually the other people keep on eyes on him/her .it really helps to the pioneers to keep their motivation level in the high .the long term high level motivation led them to successful people .second , if a person start new things there is no rule from the past .it indicates that the frontier can make their own rule for their work .it is really necessary fact that to start new thing because normaly the basic rules , made by somebody else , are preventing the procced thinking .third , the risk taker can get more oppotunities to be a successful person .risk taker can more chances than the others because if there is a risk lots of people prevent the risk and go on the easier way .hence , under the risk there are more oppotunities and chances to be a successful person .in conclusion people who do not care about risks and willing to do new things might have more oppotunities to be a successful person .for example , our ancient edison said new theory at his time .he seems failed at that time but actually in 21 centuries he is well known for a successful person over the world .there are lots of risks when person starts new things , but a person should not give up to go on it .otherwise he/she can not be a successful peson .whoever wants to be a success try new things .it works
