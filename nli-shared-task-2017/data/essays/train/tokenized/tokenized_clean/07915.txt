is the best way to travel is going on a trip in a group led by a tour guide ?if you are asking my opinion , my answer would be no .i have experienced both travelling by myself and travelling with a tour guide , and , now , i will give you a couple of reasons why you should travel alone .first of all , when you travel by yourself , you will have all the freedom in the world during your travel .i am not talking about walking down the streets by yourself kind of freedom , what i am talking about is freedom to choose what to do , where to go , and what to eat , see , or experience .i am sure the tour guide will provide you an excellent tour course for you to enjoy with your group .however , tour course will be just that , the tour course .hundreds , or maybe thousands of people may have already been to those places .is that what you want ?enjoying an experience that the rest of the world already know ?if i were you , i would love to go some places that no one has gone before , or the places that the locals enjoy , not the tourists enjoy .maybe , you will be able to find and make a local friend while you are enjoying a meal that are popular amongst locals .would that be possible if you were a member of a group who are follwoing the tail of the tour guide ?also , how can you guarantee that you will be a member of a group consist of only nice and charming guys and girls ?you will be stuck with these people for a week or even for a month , what if some of them are just unpleasant people ?let s say you are sharing a room with one of your group members , what if he snores like thunder ?i am pretty sure that is not going to be a pleasant travelling moment .if you travel alone , you wo nt have to worry about any of that .yes , you might feel lonely , you might need someone to depend on during your travel , but is nt that what the travel is all about ?if you did not want to feel lonely and be supported by your friends , you could have just stayed at your home !people always look for easier and more comfortable ways to travel .i agree that group tour maybe less demanding and easier way to travel new places .however , think about what you actually want to acquire during your travel .is it few fancy pictures of you with nice looking backgrounds ?or , is it once in a lifetime experience that you will remember for the rest of your life ?if it is the later that you want , you need to travel by yourself , and experience it for yourself .
