i absolutelly disagree with this statement , because you can turn it around and this will change the meaning of this statement : you know a bit of everything but you ca nt do anything really good .of course if you are not specialized , you can talk with everyone about everything but when a couple of specialist have a conversation , you come to a point where you do nt understand a word anylonger .you never will understand the really important facts about a subject , that s why you are hard-speaking not really usefull .i have a medical disease , for example , then i will ask a doctor and not someone who knows a bit about the human body .it also comes to my mind that it is a difficult situation at the university .for example you have to write an essay then it ll be pretty hard to make high-qualified researches , because you do nt understand the important and complicated things .that s why your grades will properly be worse than the ones of a specialist .further i have to think about the job market , e. g. the one of germany .we have many people who are unemployed and search for a work .if a company needs a thatcher , than they do nt need someone who can work a little bit with wood , who knows a little bit about the law and last but not least has already made the roof a house .they need just a specialiced thatcher .that means if you are not specialized you are nt often interessting for companys , and it ll be hard to find a job .of course there are exceptions , but to speak in general it s just harder to achieve the goals in your life .all in all i really would recommend anyone to specialize on something , because then you are able to put all your effort in this subject , it ll be easier to earn earn good grades and last but not least to find a job , that fits to your interests .
