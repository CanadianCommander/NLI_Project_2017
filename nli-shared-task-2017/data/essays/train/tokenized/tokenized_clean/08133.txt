there are people in the world that prefer doing what they have already know how to do well .fortunately , there are also people that prefer trying new things and taking risks .this second type of people is , in my opinion , the example of who is a succesfull person .a person , that bases his work only on doing what he has already know how to do welll , has few probability to emerge in his field .this kind of person , without personal ideas to improve better his works or his like , has no possibility to be a succesfull person .for istance , a worker that has nt ideas to improve his situation , has no possibility to become an executive .on the other hand , if an employe has innovative ideas for doing better his work , it is possible that he will became an executive ora chief worker .so to became a succesfull person is necessary to have new ideas and try new things , but is not at all .there is an other thing to condider , the luck !try new things leads to take risks .the luck is in important component of the risk .in general , if a person has innovative ideas and takes risk , he or she has very good probability to become a succesful person .if a person has innovative ideas and takes risks , but does nt become an executive or a chief worker , i presume he is very unlucky !!!in my opinion , this person , however , is better than a man who doesn  take any risk in his life , a man that does nt live fully .
