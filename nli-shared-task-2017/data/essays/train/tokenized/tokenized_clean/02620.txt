what is going on these days ?what about the world , countries , cities and houses that we have been living in ?i remember when i saw one of my friend , she was saying i do nt care about that kind of stuff , and also she was adding that even people who cares , they do nt have any time to discuss or help their communities to be more clean and then to live happier .i strongly believe that it is not an excuse that saying no time for helping our communities .firstly , the young people are the people who has a lot of work to do on these days .students has classes that they ca nt postpone , they have alot of homeworks to do after school .but they want to live in a better world .then is nt it so weird to want without any help ?i think that means we all are selfish .secondly , some of young people think that anyway the world is going to be worse than today , so who cares in what ways it is going to be slower .i do .i care about my family , my husband and my children , that i am going to have .i do nt want that my children has a dark future instead of clean , happy , full of people who are smiling .finally , it can be said that although young generation has an idea about the world which they are not going to change , i think with eveybody s help , even young people who are so busy on these days , the world can be a place that is more clean and happier .
