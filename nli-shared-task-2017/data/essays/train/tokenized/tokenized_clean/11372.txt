i agree that students should understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .i think understanding one specific thing such as : why the war was occured , how this problem resulted , why this music sounds this way , requires to understand backgraund of the thing , ideas , concept .ideas and concept lead you to understand why the facts were occured .i think that understanding ideas , concepts , and facts are one thing to achive your learning skills .understanding facts are the easiest thing to do the out of all three .for example , when you learn the history , teacher talkes about `` what is happened  was the first thing which is the fact .and after you know the fact , you would be interested why , how , when it happened .when i learned japanese edo era in japanese history class , the teacher taught us about tokugawa shougunn , what he did in the big government plans and changes and i was so interested how he became a head of samurai , why him , how he relate with this big government plans etc .i had a lot of questions .it was hard to understand the ideas and concepts of why and how he govern the country .i spend way more time to learn the ideas and concepts more than the facts .understanding facts in the first make you interested to know more about it .i think that learning ideas and concept leads you to understand deeper of the thing , and relate you with the thing more than understanding ideas and concepts to lead you to the facts .it is very important to relate all three , however , knowing and understanding ideas and concepts are more important to achive your learning .
