are young people not give enough time to help ing their communities ?and was it other in former times ?to answer this question you have to think about a few different points of views .the first point is that they are a lot of young people , which have some kind of `` i do nt care  opinone .they do not have targets to life for or task to do .as i drive to berlin per train to do this test a saw a few of them , already beer drinking in the moring .furthermore , there are a lot of young people which do nt have this kind of `` homefeeling  in their communities .they would take any change to leave their towns .you should not forget that , perhaps , they have to leave their communities to find a job or have a better future .however , on the other side there are young people every age which spend a lot time by helping their communities .they work in social organisations like the `` red cross  ( so , do i . )or the `` kinderhilfswerk  .althought , they spend a lot of time in social project like organisation of a camp for kids without parents or collection money for a homeless shelter .the question also implies that it was better in former times .this is perhaps true but i m to young to join this expericens .i think as time change aswell the situation als change .all in all i disagree with `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .they are helpful young people , but you have to look for these .
