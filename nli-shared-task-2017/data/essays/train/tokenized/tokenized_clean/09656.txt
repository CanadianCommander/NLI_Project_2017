i disagree that cars will decrease at society after twenty years .i have three main reasons for this : environmental problems , lacking of space to park cars and reducing fossil fuels .first of all , today , cars strongly effect to environment .thus , the goverment may restrict the use of cars .for example , automobiles emit a lot of carbon dioxide .according to research of environmental ministry ,second of all , increasing population , there are no land to park cars .it means that houses for living people will be built priolitily in free space .finally , fossil fuels for cars may shrink , because the industrial structures , factories , power plants , and so on , are more important for nations .for these reasons , i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer automobiles than there are today .
