young people often wonder about their future , questioning if they will be happier when they get old .in general , older people lives happier life than the young .first point that i want to address is that the older people are more stable emotionally as people become mature as a human being , they would not be tempered as quickly as they used to be .we discover that it is meaningness to be agressive .for example , i hated everyone at school when i was in middleschool .however , when i read to kill a mocking bird , a novel , i started to realize that it is wrong to hate someone with no reasonsecond , older people lives happier life by managing or overcomming their hardships easily .there are times of desperation and sadness in our lives .to prevail frustration is very important to avoid depression and anger , but young people usally does not have ability to do so .statistics conducted on 2006 showed that there were average thirty students for a day who committed sucide because of their academic pressure .it is relatively bigger average rate than of adults , while it is not ture that students bare more stress than adults .the last thing i have discovered is that older people appreciates things in their life more .my grandmother knows how to appreciate small thing in her life such as sunshine , food , and house ; it seems that she gets happy every moment in her life .in contrast , young people tend to be careless and negative .they say `` cool  only when there is a really nice things .in conclusion , older people tend to have happier lifes .by mangaging frustration , emotional stability , and appreciation of life able them to be happy in every aspects of lives .
