in these days , many people believe that doing what they alrealy taken certain jobs or activities is more beneficial and stable to maintain their making money .however , contrary to the popular trend , i strongly believe that trying new things and being a risk-taker is much better than being stationary .the rationale behind this is that contacting with new people and having an opportunity to success .first of all , trying innovative things can play a vital role in creating many places to meet various people .it is largely because trying the inventive things , such as self-performance on the streets .from my experience , i decided an important decision that affects my future life .the decision is studying abroad in new york .before determining my direction about going the united stated , i thought about the futures as well as my friends do .in contrast , i finally came the city to study modern education .accordingly i could meet a variety of people who work different and unique jobs .additionally , i am living with african-american person who has five jobs .i could learn many cultural differences and adopt this cultual gradually .if i had not been for taking a risk through abandoning my routine routes , i could not have met the kinds of person .furthermore , being a risk-taker contributes to catching opportunities to success .it is attributed to the fact that being in some places that can be dangerous situation , such as a owner of venture marketing includes advantages and disadvantages .however , a considerable amount of statistics have proven that the advantages are outweigh than another .the best example of this is my father s case .my father , mr. sung , started an own enterprising about manufacturing of paints 6 years ago .many peopel said that the case would be harmful to live and maintain our family s economic situation .however , he continuously struggled to overcome many risky problems .finally , we have got great success .if my father had not taken the big adventure , our family would have remained as a level of the poor .in conclusion , without the slightest doubt , trying new opportunity is more beneficial than staying stablely .the reasons are that connecting with new people and new chances to succeed was provided by taking risks .all in all .i firmly agree that the saying , `` no pains , no gains .taking risk and meeting chances only create success .
