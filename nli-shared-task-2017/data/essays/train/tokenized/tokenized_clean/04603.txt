in our scientifically advanced world , mass media have become a major part of people s lives .we consume most of our information from medias like television , radio , internet and newspaper .they all have informations for people to learn , but they also have advertisements as a part of their income .therefore , the advertisements on the mass medias have come into people s lives a lot .although the adverisements should provide accurate descriptions of its products , they often exaggerate the positive characteristics , hiding the negative part , and suggests unrealistic possibilities to convice the customers .on television , every channel has periods between programs to show the commercials .i watch most of the car commercials very carefully , because i m interested in automobiles .what i observe from the advertisements are the biased display of facts about the cars .for example , a car with very low horsepower and torque is shown only the good characteristics such as fuel efficiency .there is no way for the customer to find out how small and weak the engine is from the commercial .also the car company often increase the fuel efficiency by not giving the average , but the maximum value they got from their experiments , which is an inaccurate information for the customers .advertisments make the products look better by only giving selected and biased information .another example is advertisements lik the nike commmercials .the sports equipment brands like nike hires famous sports stars in their advertisements to connect the performance with their product .they show great actions of sports stars like andre agassi and show their products saying the their great performances are derived from the use of their products .it convinces the viewers that the products can also increase their performance as much as the sports stars  .these kinds of suggestions fabricates the product as a much better good than it really is .in conclusion , advertisements are a method for the producers to sell more of their goods .therefore it is obvious for the produicers to make their products good better in order to increase the demand .the car advertisements with selected and bias information make the customers believe the product is a better car until they find out the negative characteristics on their own .also the nike commercials with sports stars convince the viewers that the product is good enough to help them become like the stars , which is highly unlikely .i do nt believe making the products look better is neccessarily bad unless they present true information , because it is the whole point of advertisement and competition between brands to earn more money .
