the humankind always need success to reach good life standarts therefore success is very important aspect of humanlife .everybody has different points of view about the idea of success .some assume that , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrary to some think that successful people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than try new things and take risks .i personally agree with the first idea .these are my following reasons .firstly , people sould find their best way .everybody who contains also successful people always try new things .their solutions are good or bad .therefore , people find out a solution which is the best way our life .for example , my father is business man and he is very succesfull .furthermore , he is always always interested in sport and he decided buy a company about sport so he took a risk .however , now he is more successfull than last .in addition to this , taking risks are amazing .i like taking risks so much because i belive that surprising solutions make life mor joyfull and enjoyable .on the other hand , if we always do what we already know how to do well , our lifes will be so monoton and few years later we could nt love our lifes because we will know everythings solution .the last but not least , we learn more information about the earth , life , people due to trying new things .if we try how many new things , we could learn something much more last .all in all , as i said before successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .triying new experiences provide us both successful and enjoyable life as well as learning more information .
