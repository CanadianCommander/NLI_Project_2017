i think that every age has a different joy throughout a human s life .young seem to do more activities and anjoy a lot but this does not mean that older people do nt enjoy living .they also have fun but in their own ways .young people have less responsibility so they are more careless .they only try to spend their time enjoying themselves .they live for the moment without thinking about past or future .they have more energy so they get involved in physical and outdoor activities such as sporting games , concerts , parties and parks more often .they are much resistable and strong which lets them to be able to take more risks .during school years there would be a lot of friends around to spend time together .on the other hand , as people get older they take more responsibilty so they change .usually , after school they start working and later they get married .they become more mature and they learn to enjoy life in other ways .they may not go to parties , take risks or have a plenty of friends but having success in work , maintaining a happy family , having a pleasant dinner with old , trustful friends are joys of life that ca nt be replaced with anything .as people grow they see the world from a wider perspective so life becomes more meaningful and tasteful .humans may get older and may have some disabilities because of age by time but living with good memories and seeing their grandchildren is much valuable than going into pubs .in summary , in my point of view it is very superficial to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .people enjoy every stage of life if they live a successful and honored life .people should live their lives in a way that when they look behind they should not regret anything .
