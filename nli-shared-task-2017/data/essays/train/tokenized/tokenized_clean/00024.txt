now-day the market is becoming more and more competitive compared to the past years .this change of situation is due to a more sophisticated technology and a better awerness of the products .from my opinion this contest leads to a point in which the company , in order to sell more products , produces advertisements that make product seem much better than they really are .i believe that this technic is becoming a strategy used by the companies to attract the consumer s attention .in fact , once the consumer finds out that the product is not as it was pictured in the advertisement , if he has come a long way to buy the product , he will most likely purchaise it .however , it may even happen that he is so disappointed that he will not buy at all and at the same time he will make a bad advertisement both on the item and on the company .i have experienced this situation as well , in deed , on a magazine i found an advetisement of a new brand that was promoting a shirt , but when i went to the shop to buy it i found out that it did not corrispond to the picture of the magazine .in fact , it looked much better on the advertisement and the material was really bad .at this point i decided that it would have been a wast of money buying it and i left the shop .moreover , this situation is occuring too frequently and it will influence the consumer in a negative way when buying products advertised .in addition this type of promotion make break the trusty relationship established between customers and companies .in conclusion i can say that i tottaly agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and i feel that this new approch adopted by companies will have a negative impact on the market and may damage the relationship between producers and customers .
