understanding facts are more important than understanding concepts .some people said `` we have only some real facts and others are theory .but i disagree about that because of make problem when we make standard , make confuse , and attitude .when i was in high school in second grade they have problem in korean sat .they make a question about universe .but the fact is different from the answer because our text book is old one .some students complain about the question .the goverment have to agree about that .so they have to make two answer at one question .even it suppose to has one answer .our country usually think facts is more important than concepts .but this kind of problem always happend when they make standardize test .make confuse is other important reason that i disagreement .if school teach concepts more important than facts they have to make mistake when they teach their student .they have to make some example for explain their concepts .but concepts is more important than facts they use wrong example but easy to explain that concepts .maby this problem make students dum .if school teach concepts more than facts students atittude can go wrong way .in every work or problem they just think about the problem s concept .if they get bad grade because they use wrong facts they always complain to teachers and schools about their grade .they think they are right because they use right concepts .their facts are not important for them .learning concepts is useful for study ; because it s one of the easy way to unerstanding problem .and it s work pretty well at socail work .but in math and other important sceince subject it never work because it does nt need wrong facts for explain their concepts .
