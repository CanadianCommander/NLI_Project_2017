a successful human would try different newer things in his life than the older things he is used to do .changing your habbits is not an easy thing , but one is urged to do it for a number of reasons .a successful teacher should renew his lectures subjects .this indicates that he is up to date and also refreashes his mind constantly .also , this gives him a good reputation among other colleagues .take me as an example , i am teaching pharmacy students in a jordanian university , i keep getting newer information from different books and resources and include it in my lectures .it is troublesome , as it seems , but it keeps me freash in information and with a good status among my colleagues .also , this might give you the chance to create newer things .if you are a chemist , and you are constantly trying to change your ways of making , or synthesizing , chemical compunds , you might come out with less expensive methods .the newer method is considered an invention in its own , and it also saves money .also , you might think of changing your view , clothes or even your hair cut .this is refreashing for the mind , and it is attractive to others .when i change my glasses color , for example , this would be attractive to my students and colleagues and will make me feel better .also , changing the routine of life is of big importance .alternating work and dormancy in your life pace with activities and exercise is of great benefit to the body and the mind .you should not consume your time with playing or recreational activities neither should you spend it on dormancy and job , and you should remember `` a healthy mind is in a healthy body  .also , me as an example , i get involved in a different variety of research every year , this would diverse my knowledge , and also i get involved in the gym in my city this would keep me healthy .lastly , change is a different decision in the human s life , but it is important for many good reasons , and gets back on the human with good benefits .
