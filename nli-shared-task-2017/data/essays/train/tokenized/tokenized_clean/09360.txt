every one knows that when we are learning we learn facts and ideas .no one in the world can change the facts becusae facts are facts .some people just like to know the fact and they do not pay attetion to other ideas .in my case , i strongly beilive that understanding ideas is more important for students that understanding facts .i think like this beause of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respwct others , makes you creative and makes you persuisve .first , understanding ideas opens very good and big ways of thinking .it makes you think and respect other s opinions .if we look at facts , we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by disccuss them they becam facts .second , trying to understand ideas is a good way to make your brain working .it makes you creat new ideas and new opinons .on the other hand , understanding facts is like open your mind , put things in it and close it .third , understanding ideas led you to the facts .i beilive that most of the facts are coclusions for ideas .if you understand the idea you can easly figure out the fact .i think understanding ideas teaching us how to be a persuisve person because when you are trying to get a results from an idea , you are following certain and clear steps .this certain way of thinking can appears on your personality .finally , i belive that understanding ideas is very important but also we can not say understanding facts is not important .we should know the main and important facts of every thing .on the other hand , we do not o make understanding facts our way of learning and thinking .i beilive of that because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respect others , makes you creative and makes you persuisve .
