i do agree with the previous statement .on television we can always see how great current or new products are or work .the producers want to make us buy only their products and they present it as the best one ever .mostly they also add that their products are especially cheap and that it is necessary to buy it , because without them the customers were helpless .a very good example is soap for washing the dishes .in the advertisement the customer is told that the dishes will be extremely clean and shiny after cleaning with that soap .and usually they compare it to the worse ` current  and ` usual  soap .if the customer is convinced by that advertisement he will buy the product , use it and usually see that it does not work as good as the advertisement had told him .he could have also bought the cheaper one from the other store .another and similar example is soap for washing clothes .in the advertisement the customer is told that this product will wash the clothes cleaner and ` whiter  than any other product he can find .the customer will go through the same process i have mentioned above .also a good example is paste for colouring the hair .in the advertisement is shown how good the product will cover the original hair colour .the customer is convinced and buys the product , but when he uses it he has to notice that the new colour can not cover the original one the way he would like to .one example is also organized tours or holidays .the organisations offer very cheap tours to nice countries with stays in a nice hotel and flights included .thus they want to make customers use there organisation and those are often paid by hotels to bring cutomers there .but often it happens that the hotel is much worse than it had been described or the arroundings do not look as nice as on the pictures .and the pool described as ` next to the hotel and very nice pool  looks dirty and is far too small for all the hotel guests .additional to that the food might be bad or the hotel has only two instead of four stars .producers use that way of advertisement to get close to the customers and to offer them what those want , but usually the products look much nicer , only to make them attractive to the people .
