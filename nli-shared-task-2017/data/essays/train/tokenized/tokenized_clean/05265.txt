i agree and disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think whether or not this statement is true depends on age groups and on cultures and societies .in japan where students compete with each other for entering good high schools and colleges , they need to spend so much time on studying for high school and college entrance exams and they do not have time to enjoy thier life .however once they anter colleges they can spend their time on whatever they like to do .they earn money by working part time and spend the money to travel around the world or to do some sports or to have parties .after students graduate from their collesges and start working , they again lose time to enjoy their life .corporate workers in japan are expected to work very hard and for many hours a day by their companies .marrige and having children reduce their free time further and add financial burdens on them .many corporate workers long for their retirement time to come and they try to save little money they have in order to enjoy life after the retirment .in japan , snior citizens who are over 60 and retired from their work are concidered to be richest group of people .they have money from saving they did during all those years of working for their companies and also from pension fund .they have a lot of free time .hence , they have enough time and money to enjoy their life at last .the situation in japan i described may be different in other countries .in poor countries , young people can not afford to go to colleges and ther are expected to work at their early age .the governments or poor countries can not provide pension to their senior citizens , so old people there can not enjoy their life as old people in rich countiries like japan can afford to .to enjoy our life , we need some free time and money .but it is very difficult to have enough money and enough free time at the same time in toda
