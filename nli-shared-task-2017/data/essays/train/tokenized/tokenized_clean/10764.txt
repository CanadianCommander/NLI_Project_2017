before i begin to write about my opinion i would like to axplain the statements within help of some examples .to me ideas are the basic structures of behaviours .before you act you always have an idea .for example if you want to become a succesfull lawyer , you have to have the idea to attend to a law school and graduate with good grades and also you have to be socially alive .i believe that understanding ; even knowing the ideas and the concepts do nt help us to reach to the facts all the time .sometimes whatever we do , wo nt be enough for living the facts .facts are learned by living , not by ideas or concepts .for example imagine that you know what an orange is made of .or let s say that the things that we know about orange is - it s colour , that it s juicy - is it enough for us to tell about it s taste ?of course not .our ideas about orange ca nt make us think about the orange s taste .in the end taste is the fact here and the only way we can reach to that fact is by tasting it .i believe that not only students , but also all people can learn the facts by living , not only knowing the ideas and concepts .in the world we are living now , all that matters in the end , is the fact .we need money to survive = that is a fact .i can earn money by working as a barmaid = that is an idea but what if the idea do nt work ?there are some things in the world that we ca nt learn them only by ideas and concepts .what we need is the one hundred percent fact .facts hurt people , facts make people happy , facts even kill people .another example , when we steal , the place we belong is jail .that is another fact .it has nothing to do with ideas and concepts .people learn from facts and facts make people avoid from making mistakes again .as i briefly stated above , to me learning facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts .
