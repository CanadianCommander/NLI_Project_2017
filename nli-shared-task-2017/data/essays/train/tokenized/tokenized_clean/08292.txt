the issue whether the advitisements makes the product seem better than other products or not is debatable .i agree that advertisements helps to make product seem better .firstly , as we all know , many companies believe in successfull advertising and marketting to improve their product marketshare .whether an advertisement is successfull or not depends on its influence on the consumer .to influence a consumer , advertisements can represent its product far more superior through any unrelated or false evidence .since , first impression can be the last one , many consumers read or watch about the product and instanly make up their mind about the quality of the product .unfortunately , still in many countries there are no harsh legal penalties for duping consumers through these false claims and hence , companies are not discouraged from such practices .moreover , our modern economy fuelled with competition encourages and somewhat based on `` winning with hook or crook  theme .for an example , in usa , many car manufacturers are competiing to gain market and profits .but the advertisement about their car might not depict the truth about the car .advertisements are done such that , the bad qualities about the product are not highlited while the positive points are shown highly in the advertisements .so in car advertisements , if the car lacks some additional feature like , music system , then it will not be told in the advertisements , on the other hand comparative mileage will be shown as a big plus point against competitors .also , the concept of `` real  advertisement about the products may just boil down to ethical behaviour .the companies should be held responsible for double meaning advertisement about the their products which may lead to serious injury or dissatisfaction among the consumers .companies advertising the product should not leave the advertisements interpretation to the public .lack of information is same as false information in coming up with the conclusion about the product .i would like to conclude that , yes , advertisements does make the product seems better , and the main root cause behind it is the higly comptitive economy and struggle for existence among companies and products .but with strignet laws this phenomenon can be curbed and consumers can make correct decission about the product .
