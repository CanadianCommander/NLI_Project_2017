to answer if i agree or disagree with this statement , i have to make some distinctions .there are some profession that need a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and some that do not .professions like scientists in specific regions , lets say microbiologists , need a specialization .that means that they will start to study general biology and later specialize for microbiology .they might need general knowledge about statictis , mathematics and maybe some terms in the latin lannguage , but they do not need to study economy or philosophy .on the other hand there are some professions where a broad knowledge is needed .a director of a movie will need complex understanding of many different subjects .he will have to deal with actors , so he will need probably some knowledge about psychology .he will need to understand the finances of this project , have knowleadge about technical issues to communicate with the camera , light and editing team .further he will need to outweight the importance of every upcoming problem , where he will need managing skills like timemanagement .on the other hand , if you have enough time to study what you like and what you are passionate for , it will always be of help .nowadays we live in a fast changing world with upcoming challenges .no jobs will replace ohters and to have diffrent knowledges and skills will always help to increase the amount of possibilites where to work .i think that one has to see the opportunity costs and listen to one s heart what is really important for
