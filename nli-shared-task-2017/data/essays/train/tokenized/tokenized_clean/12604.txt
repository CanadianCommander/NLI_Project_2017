during my academic education of biology , i studied a wide variety of topics .beside my major subjects , ecology and zoology , i took classes in botany , genetics and physiology .after getting this scientific overview i specialized on the biology and ecology of spiders , which was also the topic of my diploma thesis .later , during my phd thesis , i very glad having received a scientific overview espacially in botany and zoology because i needed the knowledge of very different topics to conduct different field - and laboratory assays .to my opinion , it is not a mistake to take very different classes at the university , if this is still possible .this is because then you have the possiblity to choose the subject you like most and on which you can then specialize later in your studies .furthermore , you never know , which knowledge you will need for a future job .if you have a broad but superficial knowledge of some subjects , you are always able to intensitfy your studies and get more specialized in the desired topic .unfortunately , the educational systems at most universities in germy have changed since my tand mostly , it is no longe possible to study all subjects simultaneously due to limited money resources .often you have to choose your majors before getting registered at a university .i think this is not a good development at universities , becouse no one knows what fure will bring and which qualifications are needed when people have finished their university degree .
