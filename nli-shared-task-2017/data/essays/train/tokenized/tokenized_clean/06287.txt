in nowadays , it is widely known that the cars bring the convenient of traffic .we can travel some place easier and quickly .but do those cars reduce in twenty years ?in my opinion , cars will increase in the future .there are several reasons i will show as following .first of all , i think that the population is increains in the world .in the future there are more people in the world , especially in some undeveloping and developing country .in fact , in those country there are few cars .even some people have not saw the car since they were born .maybe it will have new kinds of traffic tools in the future .but i think that the most important traffic tools in those country which are not developed will buy the cars in the future .because the prise of the cars in the future must be cheapter than today .and those country could buy the cars in the future .secondly , i find that the cars is more and more cheaper .futhermore , the functions of the cars will improve quickly and powerfully .like tv , the cars will be a basic commercial in the future .and a family may have more than one car in the futher .so there will be more and more cars in use in the futher .actually , in taiwan , many famailies have more than one car , even two .thirdly , the car is convenient than other transportation .for example , the people go to work every day .but the mass transportation does not pass the place where the people want to go .by driving car you can go any places you want to go .obiviously , it is more convenient than other transportations .and in the country , it usually does not have the mass transportation .to sum up , i believe that the cars will increase in the futher .from the points above , you could get why the cars are so popular and why the cars in use will grow up .in the end , i will emphasize that the cars will be more popular in any place in the world in the future .
