the statement claims that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i disagree with the claim that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities .some of the reasons for my opinion is stated below .first , these days we see that are lot of charity organisations which are being taken up and run by young people .let us take an example of an organization called banyan , which is very popular organization in south india .the organization mainly aims at helping people with mental disabilties .this organization gives them love and support and also educates people about certain disablities like alzheimer s disease , etc .this organiztion was formed by three young girls in their mid-twenties who realized that these people need the support and love of a family .there are many such examples of organizantions coming up all across the world all run by young people .these days youngsters because of greater access to information and also as the overall standard of living of young people in the world is increasing , they want to give something back to the society that helped them grow up .there are young doctors who are ready to go to the remotest parts of the world and treat people , there are youngsters starting rallying and processions to fight for the various problems faced by the communities of the world .young people these days are aware of the situation in many parts of the world where poeple do nt get the basic neccesities of life .they want to work towards a society which is truly free and does not discriminate a person based on his color or the language he speaks or the place he comes from .let us take the 30 s and the 40 s , most of the youngsters then were at war front fighting for their countries .fighting for country does not exactly translate to working for the betterment of your community .you fight for your country to ensure her freedom .these decades , were the time when almost the entire younger generation of the world was engaged in the world war , and could not spend time explicitly helping the community .following the war came the cold war and the arms race , during this period the youth of the world were wary that a war might start and were busy protesting against it or preparing for it .following the end of the cold war , started atime when young people start making many great achievements in different fields and they all wanted give something back to the community .let us take the example of chris martin , the lead singer of a band called coldplay .the albums he and his band have made have sold in millions acroos the world , however he spends major part of his income in the fight against aids and he also to charity shows to raise money to eradicate poverty in the third world countries .thus in terms of money , time or effort young people these days are actively taking part or they are starting their own efforts to help the communities across the globe .
