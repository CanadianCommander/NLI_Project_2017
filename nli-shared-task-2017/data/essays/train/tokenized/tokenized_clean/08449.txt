i am agree with the statement that advertisements generally give wrong information about their products .if a particular product is launched then genarally companies advertise their product to people so that people buy their product more .an advertisment expalain about a particular product .it should tell about the pro and cone of it .but it can be put into negative use also .below i will explain for what kind of product genrally companies give false advertisement .in competing market generally the company says better things about a product in it s advertisement .there might be some competing products , which are already there in the market and a company come up with the same kind of product .the company tries to sell it s poduct more .so in it s information they genrally put false information about their product so that their product looks nicer than the rival product .i m giveing one example below .you can see this kind of trend more in cosmetic industry .every hair shampoo is more or less same .they all contain the same amount of chemical in it .but still every company come up with different advantages of their shampoo .they says that thier shampoo is more effective that the other .sometimes it also happen that company make cheaper product and try to sell them at higher prices .to do this they make false advertisemnt about their product .you can see this kind of advertisements for duplicate products .you can see this when a roaming salesperson come into your home for selling his product .gennerally they give wrong information about the product and try to sell them at a high price .it also happen that sometimes an advertisement says only good things about a product .they hide away the bad thing .for an example , say someone wants to sell slipping pills .the advertisement says that the sleeping pill is good , it will give you a good night sleep .but that sleeping pill might cause other symptoms also .the advertisement is not going to tell you about that .but you ca nt say all of the advertisements give false information .some of the advertisement really give helpful information about a product .we should analyze an advertisement only on it s true values .
