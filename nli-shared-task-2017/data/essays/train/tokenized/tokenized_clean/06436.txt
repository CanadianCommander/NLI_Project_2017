i can see no reasons to object it .but i would like to make it clear that this issue is limited to most of advanced countries .it is needless to say that the infrastructures and facilities is not still prepared in most of developing countries .even if the conditions is getting better , it is far away from discussing in this point .any way , there are three principal reasons to support that i completely agree .firstly , other transportation systems such us a train and a plane have been developing in the matter of time and also in the matter of money .now , the number of trains is available everyday .of course about a plane , too .gradually , the cost has become cheaper than before .actually , i could fly to u.s by 300 dollars .it is much ceaper than before .secondly , from environmental point of view , people have changed their minds into preserving clean air .this is largely due to the fact cars have influenced badly .lastly , the family structure has been changing .for instance , there many families which do not have their child in it .this means they do not need their cars to go away in more safer way .i know the importance of cars .however , i would like to stress the advantages of environmental problem .to sum up , i agree this idea .
