i do nt agree with the following statement :young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i know nowadays we are all selfish and we do nt have enough time to help others or to think or to take care about social conditions where we live in , but i know that some friend of mine spend their free time taking part in events community .helping others or taking part in social events brings gratifycation you feel usefull for the society .many young people are involved in collective activities in different places of the city .mainly these activities have the aim to help someone or to improve something which should be better .secondly i think many adults in my city do nt believe in young people and i think the governament should give voice and space avaible for all , in particular for younger .the crime and deliquency rate s increased especially between the younger , and i think the adults shoul be their teachers .the teenager is not the only one guilty .finally i think the current daily life is faster than sooner and the living condition for young people are not better nevertheless i know many people help their communities .it will be better to believe in young people
