the first point i would like to say is that i totally agree with this statement .because young people have young views towards to life .they are positive , joyfull , active persons than the older one .they can listen and learn things better , their mental have a big capacity to gain the information coming from the outside .on the other hand , older people has specisific views towards to life .they get tired of work and external factors .they wait to retraite and stay at home .and their mental is full of lots of things .they do nt want to think necessary things anymore .so young people enjoy life more than older people .enjoying life has different aspects that can differentiate from person to person .when a person has born , he or she does nt know exactly what is waiting for them .there are lot of steps waiting for them to take to be succesfull for the rest of their life .for instance ; when you finish elementary school , college is waiting for you then university moreover starting to work .first aspect is that when you are young , you can enjoy life better .you go to cinema , movies with your friends .you can go outside to eat at a restaurant or go to disco to have a great birthday party with your friends .t he second aspect is at early ages , you can learn lots of things from business and social life .your intelligence brings you lots of success to maintain your life happiness .companies search for young people to apply to the positions .you can find suitable jobs for your skills .you can earn lots of money .third aspect which is the most important one is that young people has a excellent freedom of expression and happy looking towars to life which is very important in our society .people should protect their rights and defense themselves against situations .they must have self confidence to be more successfull and to enjoy the life .on the other hand , older people experience everything through out their life .they just want to stay at home , look out of the window to see the snow .they do nt want to enjoy the life because they have experienced it before .maybe they have travel all over the world , they have gone to cinema millions of time .so they choose to enjoy a silent life .as a result , young people enjoy life more than other people by making activities with their friends , by working hard and earning money and by looking happy to the life .i agree with this statement because i am young and i am joyfull .this view reflects my life in a postive way .
