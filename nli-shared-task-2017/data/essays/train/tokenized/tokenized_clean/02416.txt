i disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i have two reasons to support my opinion .first of all , i think there is a limit that people can learn .if they want to study many academic subjects , the knowledge of them become usefulless .i think people can not concentrate them with such a lot of subjects at once !it has no meanings that people have usefulless knowledge .secondly , all of the people must have the subject they are good at and not so .for example , i belong to the fuculty of arts and letters .i think i am good at english and japanese but not good at math and science .my friends in this faculty also say that .on the other hand , my friends who are in the faculties of science , engeneering , agriculture say that they are good at math and science but not good at japanese .it is obviously on hand !studying the subjects that people are not good at is not effective .they feel more boring when they study such subjects than when they study ones they like .these are the reasons why i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .to concentrate with one subject in particular you are interested in , it is done a lot of great studies each sections .
