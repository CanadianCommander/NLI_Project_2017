i agree to the statement that most of the advertisement makes products look better than they really are .first and the important thing we should know is that the advertisement which is being made on a product highlights only the advantages not the disadvnatages .so most of them go for the product by seeing the attractive ads and then feel bad about it later .while buying a product first we should read the reviews of the product and gor for it or ask a colleague or a friend who bought it .we should make sure about the product before you buy .i like to discuss one example which i faced .i saw an ad in my telivision about the face toning cream .i got attracted to it by the way they presented in the ad and results given by some users .then i ordered the product for $ 50 after some days by watching the ad daily .then when i recieved i saw a small tube which is my little finger size .i got shocked to see it .then i called the customer service and they said the bigger tube costs $ 75 .so i ended up making a note in my mind that no more ordering by seeing ads .one more example i like to discuss is about my friends daughter .the cute little girl saw in the cartoonnetwork an ad and started asking her mother about the toy .that toy can be puchsed only through online ar by phone .so my friend orderd the toy .when they received it the girl started crying that its not the toy she saw .later they found from other families that the same thing happened to them also .so i like to say that there should be a law to make sure that the info in the ad before advertising a product is everything true and aslo they should make sure that they advertise the disadvantages also .
