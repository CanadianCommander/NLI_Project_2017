as far as i am concerned , i think young people enjoy life more than seniors do .there are two reasons to support this idea - health , and society .first , young people are passionate and healthy .since they are healthier than older peole , they can more travel or do activites than older people do .older people get easily tired and need the rest , because of that , it takes much more time for seniors to travel or do activites while healthy young people do much more activities .also there are many activites that require a good health such as sky diving , soccer , and so on .since these activities are difficult for old people , they can not do or enjoy these activities even though they really want to do those .so there are many limitations to older people .however , many young people with a great tenacity can enjoy aggresive activities and can do in a long period of time .the other reason that young people can enjoy life more than older people do is society .in society , there are many businesses making many entertainments .the problem is that their targets are mostly young people , teenagers or ages of twenty to forty .the reason is young people usually make money , however old people usually retired from their jobs and became unemployed .for example , movie theaters , or amsement parks are usually noisy and are packed with a huge number of people which are the exact conditions that many old people do not like .by time goes by , many companies emerges to the society and they produce many entertainments for young people , not old people .therefore , there are getting less things to enjoy for old people .some people may think that older people and young people equally have chances to enjoy their lives .however , due to the fact that young people are healthier and more make money and society does not care for older people in entertaiments field , i think young people are likely to live in enjoyable lives .
