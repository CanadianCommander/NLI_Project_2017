advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life , in several supports and in severals ways .to wonder if advertisements make products seem better than they really are could be seen as a non-sense question , because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unreplacable .that is why i agree with this statement .advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product .it s also the only way to get people aware of a new product , and obviously the better is this product , the more people will buy , even if it s just to try .so my first point is that advertisements should and must make product better than they really are , because they re made for that .my second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it s best .i mean that advertising is also a way to build an image , a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product .for example , in advertisements for cars , advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on , in order to attract a specific range of customers .they can insist on security , fun , sportivity , but it s always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving .so advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product .obviously all people are not sensitive to the same purposals of advertising , and that s a way to highlights the weakness of advertising .an ad ca nt be liked by everybody , and sometimes ca nt be understood by anybody .so ads can also be unproductive and unefficient .the point is that i believe that advertisement can be both very profitable and dangerous for a producer .that s why i finally confirm that i really think that advertising is very powerful , and very important for the life of a product , but it has to be well prepared , well broadcast to be very effective .
