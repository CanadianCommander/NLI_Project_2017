`` the younger generation just dont listen and pay gratitude towards community  .this is the statement i very often listen from my grandfather .have the younger generation actually become so selfish and preoccupied in their own world that they do nt even have time for their own people ?being a young man myself , i feel that it is shameful , but true .with the advent of technology , the world has become fast paced .everybody is short of time is always busy with worldly matters .the greatest impact of this is seen in the younger generation .younger generation are called the future of a nation .they constitute that section of the society which is very vibrant and full of energy .at the same time they are also immature and tend to get influenced by external forces , the most .so , they tend to get distracted to a number of activities around them .so getting attracted to rock music , going to concerts is natural .but let me pose a question to all the youngsters - have you ever gone to do community services - like helping old people , helping out orphans , or planting trees ?i bet the answer to my question would be a unanimous `` no  .futhermore , youngsters nowadays are excessively involved in partying with friends or playing online computer games that these type of community activities have the least priority on their list .infact , these are sometimes considered to be boring and the `` older people s job  .the young people need to realise this fact that it is due to a mutual interaction between an individual and his community that an individual develops .so , the individual requires to take care of his community .but , is it that it is solely the younger generation responsible for this apathy .i think there is some other aspect to this discussion as well .this is based on what i have seen in my college .there is a small percentage of youngsters who are interested in doing good for the community , but due to the excessive pressure of the parents to excel in the exams , loads of courses that we are required to complete and excessive competition , these students are unable to do anything concrete .who is responsible for this the youngsters or the elders ?it is pretty clear , the authorities have to think on these lines if serving the community is a matter of concern .for example , the college authorities can float a compulsory course in community service .so , in a way this course will motivate other student as well as let the already interested students to participate .in conclusion , the younger generation need to realize that it is their responsibility to help the community because it is only bcause of this community that they would flourish in the future .they need to understand that if they help the community the community would surely pay them back in a good way .
