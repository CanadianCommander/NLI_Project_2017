`` understanding gives you a better clarity and vision rather than learning facts  , i agree to the point that understanding ideas and concepts has a better results than simply learning it .when you are learning the facts , what exactly happens is that if you are not repeating it again and again you tend to forget the concepts and ideas .in learning you try to memorise the text without looking at it s practical implemntation and after a period of time it gets vanished .learning could be lucrative only when you have to swallow things like .in history , where you have to learn the time and series of events that has happened in past .but in creative and intelectual subjects like .science , arts , mathematics it is not good to simply learn things because these areas need you to understnad the ideas and concepts .in understanding the ideas and concepts yoy use the creative , active and imaginative part of your brain .when you understand something you do nt have to push yourself to revise it again .taking `` mathematics  as example when you understand the concept geomatry , than only you will be able to use it properly and efficiently .understanding the ideas and concept opens your brain to see every part of the subject .and after doing a brainstorm with urself you understands the fact which you never forget .understanding a concept is easier to do than learning it .it is often seen that students focus more on learning things than understanding because they have their exams pressure on them .at last i would suggest that the dynamcis of an educational course should emphasis more on giving a better understanding .when an individual understand a concept it comes into his behaviour .learning is like looking at the ocean from a distance and understanding is more about enjoying the depth of it .
