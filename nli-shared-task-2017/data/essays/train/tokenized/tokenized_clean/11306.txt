nowadays , young people could get much more information than before .sometimes , they got too much information and too much things have to do or read , cause them have to spend their time staying at home or working .young people have no time to help their communities because of their busy and irresponsibility .first , young people will force to study and learn other skills such as playing piano or guitar .they have to spend their time in classes over eight hours in a day .that means , they lost their leisure time to be together with their communities .they do nt have any chance to know what happened to their communities and also do nt know how to help them .young people lacked of time to care about their communities because they even do nt have to time to prepare their works .second , young people are not so responsible as the old people .for the traditonal custom , old people will consider communities as an important role for them .in spite of they are busy , they will spend their time in communities and try to help or slove any problems .however , young people were spoiled by their parents for a long time that made them locked of responsibility .young people did nt take this duty as regarded .they do nt care about others except themselves .they are rather staying at home than going out even thought the communities are outside .young people for nowadays have different thoughts .they are too self-esteemed and selfish which cause them not to care about their communities .they might have some times can help or do something for their communities .howere , they hate to do these because they do nt want to get any troubles in case .they also do nt want to argue with their neighbors while they have their own opinions .as time changed , young people dislike to help their communities .
