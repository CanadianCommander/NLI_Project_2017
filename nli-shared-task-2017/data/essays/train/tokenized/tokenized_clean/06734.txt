travel is the most thing exsiting in our live .people who travel alone or groups is mazing and has advantiges and diesadvanteges .when you travel by alone that gave you more fredomes .on other hand , the travel with guide you have to listone to him all the time .first , the tavel in groupe is more savety and goood to explein what you see and howyou feel .however , the travel alone gave you some thing of miss chanse and boreing .when you travel under guide that make you ask him if you do nt know any thing abuot some thing you pass it or see it .sometime you tired from this person but you have to more pationt and also if that persone take every thing seriose and dose nt make joke or some thing funysacaned , the you the travel with groups you do nt know them and no leader that make the trip and the line of the travel is confused .for example , one time i travel with my friends to hunting and this sport is the famuse and lovely in my country .however , when the move we chose one leader and he was the best leader i see because he orgnize the trip and make every one happy .formore the travel with gruops under led make the trip orgnized .finally , the traveling with groups make you contain every thing in that trip .in my opinion i prefer travel with gruop under one condetio they have leader all the trip to make this trip keep in the momeris and do nt forgot even this leader dose nt has ability to make this trip perfect .in the end some people prefer travel under guide some ather not but still the travel the beautufil thing .
