i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .the following explanations shall provide the basis for my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do .young people often seem to be happy and cheerful .they participate in a lot of activities , are often around other people and enjoy their leisure time with exciting things .older people often stay at home , do not have many different activities in their daily life and seem to be less excited .the above statements decribe the surface of what the life of these two groups of society is like .in my opinion it is more important to take a look under the surface and to find out about the mental state of these people .young people often find themselves being put under pressure .life for them is very difficult .they are growing up and their environment and their own attitudes and opinions change very quickly .it is difficult for young people to take decisions and to be strong .this leads to a variety of mechanisms of self-protection , which often imply an activity-oriented life .for example , many young people often go to parties .they seem to be enjoying life as much as possible .however , they are often just taking a break from their stressful life , but are still not able to truly enjoy their life .they are not truly relaxed and happy , bcause they are not really doing what is best for them .older people have mostly passed this phase of doubts and difficulties .they show a more relaxed attitude towards life and its surprising turns .this group of the society knows that mistakes are made and wrong decisions happen , and have learned to take everything easier .moreover , older people to not let themselves be put under pressure by other people or circumstances .they show the ability to take more decisions in their own interest and to know what they want for their life .for example , they do not go out to parties as much as young people do .they know better that activities including a more personal social contact is worth more than just pushing away their problems .older people are choosing their best opportunities for life and enjoy them .the above paragraphs argue my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
