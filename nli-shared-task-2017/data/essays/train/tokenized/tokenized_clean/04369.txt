many people can not decide whether having broad knowledge about academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for individual s career .in my opinion , people should focused on one topic and specialized in it .by having deep information and significant experiences on an issue , people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job , salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area .first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compare to other people .because , companies today generally looks for people in a specific topic .the reason for this is that today s companies are working on a detailed subject .it is clearly seen that there are not so much companies that works on differents areas .therefore , this situation pushed the companies to find people that have important experiences and knowledge about their job .secondly , in today s world , if a person is an expert in an issue , then this person takes high salary compare to other employees .because it is hard to find an expert for companies for a job position .therefore , big companies can give high salaries to these people .finally , technology forces people to become an expert .the main reason for this case is that technology is developing day by day and it is not possible to have `` enough  information about a topic .i stated that because if you want to produce something or create a product , you should have detailed information about it .by only this way , people can be creative and valuable in their companies .to sum up , having detailed knowledge about a topic will become people more lucky than other people .they can get high salaries and they can be `` wanted  people among companies .if people chooses the second choice , than they may not be special in the market .
