i do nt agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .even though young ages looks like the best times for enjoying life , very few young people are aware of that .they just try to solve the vast problems of growing at that ages .but older people gain wisdom with time and have the ability of enjoying life .a lot of people s memories about their young ages are full of problems and struggles of life .at least mine is like that .because young age means growing and not only your age grows but also your responsibilities grow .you do nt have the time to enjoy life .you have homeworks , girl/boy friends and a family to deal with .and it is not an easy task for you because you have learn from the beginning .if ever you manage to overcome the problems of young age , you do nt have the necessary wisdom to enjoy life .on the other hand , old ages are the best times for enjoying life .the very struggles that kept you away from enjoying life is gone .there may be some problems but at old ages people have wisdom and experience to deal with these new problems .and wisdom brings happiness .old people look life in a different perspective than young people .they know that life is not just a constant struggle .in a way they make peace with everything ; themselves , other people , and the life itself .so , i think that old people enjoy life more than young people .young ones do nt have necessary wisdom to enjoy life but people eventually gain wisdom by time and learn how to enjoy life .so old people enjoy life more than
