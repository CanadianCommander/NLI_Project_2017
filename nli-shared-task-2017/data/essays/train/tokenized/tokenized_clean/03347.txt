i think young people do nt give so much time for communities as ages ago , but they still give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays the communities have lost a lot of their importance .years ago , communities were much more important , because a person spent the whole or nearly the whole life in the same community .today , in a globalized world , one lives for some years in one community and for some years in another community .people change much more their place of living and they are not so dependent on communities as in earlier ages .for this reason people , especially young people , do nt identify themselves so much with one community and because of that they are also not interested in spending a lot of time for a community .another reason is , that young people do nt have so much time as in earlier ages .especially school and university became much harder .because of that , young people have to spend much more time studying and do nt have a lot of time for their communities .also at work , young people are more and more under pressure and have to work more .they also have to improve their skills and therefore have to go to an evening school or something similar .nevertheless , it s not the case that people do nt spend time to helping their communities .in my opinion they do it in a more indirect way .they support organisations as `` wwf  or `` amnesty international  which do nt work in a particular community ; they work global .but their work contributes to the whole world and also to the communities .it s important that somebody cares about the environement and happenings in the world , which in fact influences all of us , also the local communities .because of the above mentioned points i think that young people give enough time to their communities , even if it is in an indirect way .
