i definetly agree with the statement : `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  because , if i am not mistaken , it has always been a use of persuation to perfectionized materials who lack characteristics .the advertisement companies do this because it is their jobs to captivate the attentions of all human beings .if they did make products seem better that they are we will live in a world full of boring and unuseful things .for example , let s stay on entire day in front of a television watching and analyzing commercials .how many times people have seen a mcdonald s or a burguer kings commercial with a gigantitc , juicy , and the most fresh vegetables ever seen ?always .why ?becuase it attracts people , it makes people want and desire things the really do not want .in myentire life have i eaten a burguer like i just explaines ?no .people often confuse reality with illusion .commercial ar specifically made to make people beleive they will find and eat the best burguer they have tasted in their lives .another example is the big boards in the middle of the roads .those big boards are made to catch , immediately the attention of the drivers and the passengers .the big board are often filled with announcement of new clothing , a new alcoholic beverage , a concert , new kinds f foods , etc .i thinks the best way to make products seem , a little more of what they are , by this method .this methos is simple and acquirate , and will helps us catch the true glance , freshness , originality of the product .as people know , we live and will always live in a world full of unrealistic and illusory advertisement in order to get people to want , buy , feel , taste the products they are announcing .it is just a metter of how much we are going to let ourselves be persuaded and how much and to what extent we are going to let people sells us thing they know they are unable to produce or give .
