i agree to that statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .the main area on which the resoning of this sentence depends on the difference between the `` young people  now and in the previous days .i feel there is a change in the responsibility levels of the young people from olden days to present .there is much burden on them now , either in away taking care of the entire family or being a bread winner for the family .this makes them to spend most of the time in earning money .so the young people are restricted in taking care and heliping their own family .the community form a group of families which in turn becomes difficult to takecare and provide help as he has been fully bundled with his own family .in olden days young people are doing more of charity work and help other people and are less selifish .so they spent time in helping the poor and the people who are lacking in few things with whatever they have .for example the person who is good at studies has put up centers for educating the illeterates which is profit free organization .helping others was prevalent in most of the young people in those days which inturn helped the communities .but in the present day we see no caring attitide in the young people for the others in the community .as cited above there will be long barrier between each families in order to help each other because of selfishness , no caring attitude , egoism etc .for example the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer .i feel that invloving in community activities is always better .the policy should be help yourself and help others .so that once we are done with taking care of our needs , family needs and if some time is present we can use it effectively by helping the other community people .we can understand their problems and provide a feasible solution to those .we can always indulge ourselves in the charity organizations children rilied fund and red cross and many more with in our limits and help the world to be a better place .in doing so one will emerge out as a great person in his life and will encourage others with the same .
