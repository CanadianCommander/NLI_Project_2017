yes , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialisze in one specific subject because of various reasons .if a person has knowledge about a particular subject , it is good .but if he wants to refrain himself from foraying from other subjects he should make sure that he is very thorough with that subject .because finally he should find a job on that basis only and more ver all the academic topics are interconnected so , it imperative to have knowledgein various fields .the above option would be good only if he find a job .he should always keep in mind the different possibilities in hi carreer .he should ask himself `` what if i dont get a job in his desired field of study ?for example i am a mechanical engineering student .as every one knows there is a scarcity of jobs for mechanical engineers .if i continue with the same field would be left unemployed .here i need to have an alternate option .i have my alternate option as computer sciences .i started learning some computer subjects .now even if i donot get a job in my field of study , i may have a chance of getting it in field of computers .this would not leave me unemployed .i personally feel that being employed is better than being unemployed .this criteria not ony works for two fields of same backround , it also works for a technical background and an arts background .for example , an electrical engineer who doesnot have a job and whose hobby is singing , can survive by giving some stage shows .which would also be considered as an employment .moreover , broader knowlege would not leave you speechless when you are in a group .because when agroup is discussing a topic and if you are silent , you may feel embarassed with that .but if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic .this is possible only if you donat confine yourself to a particular fieldi conclude that having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one subject .
