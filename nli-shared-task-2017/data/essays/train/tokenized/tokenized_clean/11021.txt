many people in the world try to enjoy their life .however some people think older people can not enjoy life , but that is just a stereotype .old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies .young people usually like sports that old people can not do .there are some hobbies that old people can do such as , knitting , watch movie , plant their own gardens .forexample , i watched my grandfather s one of daily life .he likes to plant flowers .when he got up in the morning , he went to flowershop and looking for the special flower seeds .and when he back to home , he sprayed the water the flowers .sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour .he loves to do it .the second reason is not only young people have their friends .forexample , my grandmother has lots of her friends .in last month , she traveled to europe with her friends .she said it was the best travelling ever done before .she did lots of shopping , and saw many beautiful european buildings .however , she said , the best part of the travelling was talking with her friends .when people get old , they still like to spend a time with their friends and enjoy the time with them .forthose reasons , old people can enjoy thier life with their friends and hobbies .especially my grandfather and grand mother , they really love their life .if someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special , that is not true , they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time who they wants .if they find their hobbies and friends , they would live their life better than younger people .
