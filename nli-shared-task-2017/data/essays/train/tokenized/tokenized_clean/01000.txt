i completely agree with this statement .when people try to innovate in a certain matter they are using all their capacities to obtain success .risking yourself will give you courage that will help you to continue the path you have proposed yourself .all the people live with the capacity of making some improvement in something .some take advantage of this , some others do not .when people try to go through the easy path , they know they will have less posibilities to fail but that they will not be able to succed .success is something that comes only when you really put effort in something , the most classic example would be someone trying to open a certain shop .if that person works hard and take the risk to sell something innovating they will not always be able to grow economically but spiritually .knowing thay you tried best you can will be the best reward you will ever gain .but here comes the point were we shoud ask , what is success ?is it obtaining economicall profit ?or maybe is more than that ?success is not something material , success is something that comes when you know you are making something you were ment to be , no matter what the odds were .trying hard and failing , so you have the chance to try again is the path to succes .this is not something you will obtain by following normal patterns of behaviour or conduct .putting yourself in difficult situations and unpredictable scenarios makes you work at all your capacity and the reward for this is plainly success .a man that declines a transference of his workplace to a place were he would earn more money so he can stay more time with his family , will become a succesful person .he wo nt have economicall beneficts , but the satisfaction that his desition brought him will make him know that he triumphed in life , that he is really succesfull .succes will not come to people that are blindly following patterns and doing only what they think they can do , it s in the action of taking risks were people are able to discover what they are really capable of and as a result become successful persons .
