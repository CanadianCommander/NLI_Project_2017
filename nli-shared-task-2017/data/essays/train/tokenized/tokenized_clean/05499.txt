the primary role of advertisement is to increase a firm s profit by boosting the sales of a product .to achieve that goal , the firm has to show the most attractive part of the thing they want to sale .to make something really attractive , advertisers have to prove the potential customers , that their product is better than each other .that s why a lot of them have the desire to embellish their product .for example , in each car advertisement , we hear that this specific car is the best one , and that girls will love you because you own it .so we could consider that such a tv spot try to make the car much better than it really is .nonetheless , i m convinced that men who watch or read such an advertisement know that girls wo nt love them more just because they own that car .but they keep the spot in mind and the more they see the car , the more they could desire to own it .so in that case , advertisers have accomplished their mission , because they have succeded in increasing the car sales .moreover there are a lot of precise rules which make that an advertiser must not lie on the skills of a product .if we go back to the example of the car , a spot must not claim that the car has an airbag if he has nt .even if they can find a way to make their products seem very beautiful or very good , the law sets some limits , and the firms must nt do what they want with the advertisement .finally , in a certain extent , the law provides a security for the customers , because they can be sure that the description of an object will be the same than in an advertisement .but i know that firms often find guiles to make things seem more beautiful to be more competitive .
