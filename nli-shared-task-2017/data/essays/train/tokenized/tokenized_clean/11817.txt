there are several viewpoints on , `` is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one  .both views have their own individual pros and cons .there are so many aspects to consider .let me explain some aspects in the following passage .first consider , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .by knowing all these subjects we have alot of advantages .we can have a good future , good knowledge on all subjects . ..etc .by knowing all subjects we can have a future in any field .we can have alot of choices to earn money .you never feel any difficulty in life regarding subject knowledge .for example , let me tell you about my profession .i am a architectural student .if i learn autocad , photosho - p , 3dmax . .etc .with these i can have more future options .thus i can earn alot of money in different fields .these have some problems .i prefer advantages should always be greater than disadvantagessecond let me explain about knowledge in one specific subject .this can help in someways .we can have good future , money in that subject .even one can become researcher , who helps society in alot of ways .from that way one can earn money .for example , let me tell you about my profession .if i have indepth knowledge in designing and construction of buildings , i can settle down as a architect and i can create magics .the main problem is if i do nt get a chance to proove myself , i ca nt earn money .if we consider the other side of the statement , it is having so many problems thereby we can not have much knowledge about everything , we have to fix in one field .i am inclined to support both positions because both have their own views .however , i suggested more towards having knowledge in many academic than in onme specific one .so , i agree in parts with the statement .
