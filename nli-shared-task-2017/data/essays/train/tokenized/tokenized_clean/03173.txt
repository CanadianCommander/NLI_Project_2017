i do nt think it can be considered as a `` natural rule  the fact that older people enjoy life less than young people do .at the same time i must say that it is what generally happens , and for several reasons .first of all , we live in a society ( i m specifically talking about the italian society ) in which the age a person decides to leave his family , for many reasons such as lack of job opportunity , lack of `` bravery  and so on , is close to 30 .this means that , until that age , young people do nt face a lot of responsabilities they ll be obliged to face in the future .less responsabilities for young people means at the same time :a ) more available time for them , who generally use it to enjoy life ;b ) less available time , and more and more thoughts in consequence to their responsabilities , for the parents .this is the general scheme of a normal italian family s dynamic .fortunately it-s not always like that .my personal experience support me stating hat .in fact i left my house when i was 18 and i came to live and study here in milan , where i found a job and have my life without any dependence from anyone .that allowed also my parents to spend the time they `` earned  in some other activities , like having hobbies , or developing their personal interests .enjoying their time .enjoying their life .even if this is the most important reasons that brings me to affirm that young people generally enjoy their life more than older ones , there s a second that is just a physiological reason .it is not difficult to understand that when we are young , we feel like we can climb mountains , travelling around the world without stops .we are full of energies , our bodies are ready to face almost every kind of situation .it is not the same thing for older people , who necessarely have to maintain a sort of proportion between their efforts and the forces they dispose of .a lot of things become forbidden just for physical reasons .but on the other hand , as i said before , older people can enjoy their life in a different way , proportioned to their possibilities , like travelling , or developing interests
