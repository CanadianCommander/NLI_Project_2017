no , i will not agree with this statement that , `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .because , if we observefrom last twenty years the cars usage has been increased rapidly .why it has been increased iwill explain in the below paragraph .if a person who is working as an software engineer he ca nt wait at bus-stops for buses and railway-stations for trains .because he has to spend much more time on that .so if he has a car he can save much more time .this is the main reason for increse of cars .the usage of cars leads to more advantages than disadvantages .while the `` call centers  people have to travel from home to office at late mid nights .so if a car is there it will be well safe than a bike or any other vehicle .in the coming years also the usage of cars will double or may be triple the times what we have now .because this is the fast moving world .to lead a better life in this fast moving world a good car is needed to move whereever we want to go .we all know that if the usage of cars have been increased it seems that their country or state is developing .i say that car users will increase in countries where there are few cars now .but the growth will decrese in some developed countries like newyork , london , australia etc . ..there they will use chartad flights which are now very fewer there .the advantages while using cars are that we save much more time while by spending for trains and buses .we can save tht time and spend that with family , friends or in the office .it leads to lot of convinience by using car .i will conclude that by the above reasons the car users will increase by the next twenty years in this fast moving world .
