some people might say that try new things and take risks to suceed .but i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreay know how to do well .because those who are working like professional , they have confidece and dream when they work .first of all , they are not always successful either they try new things or not .i think the most important thing is confidence for success and without knowledges , it is hard to try new things and take risks .for example , one of my friend studied economic but now he wants to transfer to art school .does not it make sense ?he had not been drewing about 20 years , so that he gave up .like i said , when we try something new things , even we should have basic technic or knowledge .in addition , we have to have dreams for our successful life .there are so many people who try to new things without dream .in my opinion , if we just work without dream , we need more time to suceed than peolple who have dream .for instance , in korea , people try to suceed everyday .but it is extremely hard to suceed , even they have skills .thus many koreans surrender their job then they have their own business and they are more successful in life than people who go to company everyday .in conclusion , we all want to suceed .but in order to suceed , we have to have confidence and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do very well .if we always try new things without know-how , we always might be behind .
