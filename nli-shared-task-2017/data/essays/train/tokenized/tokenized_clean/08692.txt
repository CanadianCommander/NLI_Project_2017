i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .travel to an unknown destination can be challenging and maybe even intimidating to some .but i personally believe that exploring and discovering the unknown is the real thrill in travel .a tour guide would take his group to all the popular tourist destinations , following a set schedule and give them a brief history of each place .when you travel on your own , you are on your own schedule .people are most likely to travel when on vacation , and you certainly do nt need to abide by a schedule when on vacation and away from work .when you are travellling on your own , you can get a map , scout places , get recommendations from locals and visit all the places that seem intruiging and appealing to you .you can read up and learn about the history in ways that you would like and not have some guide rattle it out to you .if safety is of concern , you could always travel with a group of friends and still set your own pace .memories of places visited would have more excitement , as it would not be just the history of the place that you would take with you but also all your efforts in getting to the place and other such experiences .on your own , it is more likely that you would visit a place that is not a common tourist destination but one that definitely meets your tastes and expectations .when travelling or visitng new york , a tour guide would definitely take you to see the empire state buidling , times square and the statue of liberty but for a complete expereince of a new yorker , you would need a lot more than that .to summarize , i would like to say that travel on your own is definitely more rewarding than travelling in a group with a tour guide .i seriously doubt that a tour guide showed columbus the way .and what a loss it would have been for america not to have been discovered !
