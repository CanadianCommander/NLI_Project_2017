in the case of latin america i think that is better to have a broad knowledment of different subjets because you can manage more activities and realize multi-task jobs .in my own experience , to find a job the recluiters ask you not for specific knowledge in a specific field .they ask you more about the knowledge in different areas that can help you to solve problems .in addition , when i was working i learned about diffrerent subjects because my job demand it .for example , i am electrical engineering so i have a background in electronics and technical aspects , my last work was project management so i learned about risk of the projects , financial stuffs , logistics , manage of human resources .i have friend , he s profession is architect and he read a lot about different subjects because he is trying to apply the mathematics , the psicology , and the maketing to the decoration of a room .he analizes the psicological profile of his clients and try to design according with their interest and hobbies .the people who have broader knowledment can manage more tasks and can make the jobs that others dont know .its easier to explain how to make something to a person who has knowledge in more fields .on the other hand , some activities requires specialized resources for example people who repair , and build airplanes .those works need specialized knowledge , but needs more years of specializacion in a field .in conclusion , i m agree with the statement because for the society its better to have people with knowledge of different branches .in the case of latin america the people can make multi task jobs .
