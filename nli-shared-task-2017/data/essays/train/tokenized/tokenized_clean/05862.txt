i am agree with the opinion that there will be less cars in use than there are today in twenty years .one reason is the oil is limitid and it get less and less resently .and the now energh such as sunshine is not able to take the part of oil .we may have a lot of difficulty to solve the energy problem .after twentiy years oil could be not enough to apply to all the cars we have , so apart of people have to choose another way for traffic .or more people choose the eletric train to go to work or study .another reason for this is that people could not have to be in the office to work in the future .now mor and more people choose the way to at home .the internet is changing our world , we can make a meeting on the internet easily and make report and send it to the office by mail .because of this a lot of people do nt need to drive to the office every day and even some of the people do nt need a car at home .the traffic is not stop to change its style in the history .we can imagine that may be in the futhure people can find some more useful way for traffic such as personal plane .i belivie that car will be less than
