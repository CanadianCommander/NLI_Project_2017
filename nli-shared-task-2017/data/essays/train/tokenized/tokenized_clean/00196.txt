enjoying life to the fullest has always been the aim and desire of man .everything we do during our lifetime is to quench our thirst for living a better life .but everyone has a different definition of enjoying life .usually the youngsters have a different method of enjoying life than the old people .but this method is taking its toll on us .the risk factor associated with the willingness to try everything - which is always associated with the way youngsters enjoy - makes this method one which is not worth giving even one try .the young people aim to enjoy all the joys which the life has to offer .but this type of enjoyment is only superficial and short-lived .after some time , the youngsters get to see the serious and dark side of the life .also they realize the futility of what they think to be enjoyable .but the old people - the more wiser and the more matured , those who have seen what life is all about - have a different and a more fulfilling way of enjoyment .they prefer to relish their own achievements and accomplishments which have made them what they are today .they have a more practical and wiser approach towards life and they know the limits of enjoyment .the young people , on the contrary , do not know their limits and may take their enjoyment to such a height from where return might not be possible .or even if the return is possible , it would not be in the manner we would like it to be .to elaborate this point , consider the example of a group of partying teenagers .they are still novice when it comes to the skills of living life .in their desire for enjoyment and willingness to try everything new and `` cool  , they might use drugs .the original intention might be innocuous but it may lead to addiction or even death .is this what you call enjoyment ?mixing drugs with your drink so that you can dance all night long is not called enjoyment , not at all .it is actually called sheer stupidity .taking foolish steps whose consequences we are unaware of can lead to deep regret later .but what about the old people ?i think these are the people who enjoy more than the young generation .how ?these people have actually gone through all that mentioned above .they know that one single mistake can actually bring your whole life to a mighty crash .and there is nothing bad or `` dangerous  in sitting with old friends and reminiscing about auld lang syne .it is not the young can not enjoy , it is just that they do not know `` how  to enjoy .actually , the youth is the time to enjoy and make merry , but today s generation seems to misinterpret it .there is a different and a better way of enjoyment than taking drugs and repenting one decision all life long .
