i strongly believe that it is crutial for students to learn and undertsand ideas and concepts than to blindly learn facts .it is important to do so as it is neccessary for a person to undertsand information before applying it .many a time we will encounter situations in our lives where we may need to apply concepts or facts that we know .information that can not be applied when needed is completely useless to us .it is very easy for people to learn and memorize facts , but if they do not understand what they memorized , information that they just absorbed will prove to be completely useless to them .for example , if a student learns a basic concept required to apply in a simple problem of mathematics , he or she can not use the information they learned in order to solve a more complex problem of the same kind since they never were able to understand the main concept behind it .if a person just learns facts , he or she is not excercising their ability to question .questioning is a very important aspect in learning .if people do not question , it is very difficult for them to develop intellectually .as questioning leads to reasoning and without reasoning one can not understand facts .if we learn facts blindly , we are not applying the potential within is .this may cripple our ability to advance .there will not be any difference among humans and computers , except that we perform human functions such as breathing and eating and they do not .after all , computers were created to learn , not think .facts are inputed in them , they do not have the ability to understand concepts .we created computers because we understood concepts and idea , we can not advance if we stop taking advantage of our abilty to understand and reason .
