i think that today , with the advancement in tecnology , anything is possible .i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .there can possibly be total minimisation in the number of cars too .since the beggining of time , man has survived through many ways .not only is he fighting to survive , but he is trying to improve the condiitions around him , so he may make his life more comfortable .cars started with travel through animals ; in early times , people would sit on horseback or on a donkeys back to reach his destination .then later came the bullock cart , where the animal pulled the cart which was on wheels .like this , many advances have been made in the means of travel such as bicycles , tricycles , motor cycles , trains , ship , planes and ofcourse the most convenient means of transport - the car .nowadays , that is , in the twenty first century , in many places , the metro is being built .it is a development of the trains which are generally used to travel long distances .the metro , is a faster mode of trains , it can be used to travel short distances - which may take the place of cars .cars , being a very useful vehicle , has a lot of disadvantages such as parking spaces - nowadays , almost every family owns three cars .parking is becoming a great problem , as there is no space at all .another problem is traffic .traffic is the worst problem of all - it causes people to get late for appointments , meetings or other important places .even the price of the cars are rising , which people can not afford as there are other expenses to make too .so , i think , that in the near future , many people might sell their cars and may travel by metro which is built in many countries such as india , u.k. , u.s.a. , and is being built in many other places too .i think it will be much more convenient for those people who do wo nt use their car and for those who still have their cars , because there will be less traffic and less parking problems .
