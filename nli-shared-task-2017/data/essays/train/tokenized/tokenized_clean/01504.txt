majority of people are really effected from advertisements ; as a result of that companies use this way to support the consumption of their products .i agree with the statement that products seem better in most advertisments .not tested products are selling on markets /firstly ; the most important thing is to effect women who spend most of their time by shopping .especially make up products are on market with just small changes .by changing its cover or smell its sold like a new product .also hygenic products must be tested .sometimes in advertisements it says ; our new product is for sensitive and allergetic person nonethless when you use it you see that it is not real .secondly children want to buy whatever they see ; bright covers or little toys which are given with the product effects them .on the other hand with the improvement of technology new products are on market each day .for example last month i bought a new mobile phone which i saw an advertisement on tv .it is said hat it does not effected from water and i dropped it in the rainy weather and as a result i can not use it anymore .after market services must be effectedin conclusion ; i agree with the statement that sometimes advertisements are not showing the truth .they mostly the new producing way of a product with small changes .
