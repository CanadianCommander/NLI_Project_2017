does having knowledge in all types of academic subjects is better than being an expert on only one single subject ?actually i both agree and disagree about it .because both of them has advantages in some sort of areas .a person must always try to learn more and more in my opinion .because it is a key to success .a person who is able to speak about every subject gets respect from people .because by this he/she can prove himself to everyone in every field .for example in social life or in bussines .if a person has an idea and thoughts about every argument or debate he is in , he will just keep getting respect from people .i am not saying that a person must be a genius in every fields .he only has to gain some information to prove that he has thoughts to be considered by people .if you want to be taken serious by them you must gain respect and this is a way for it .but a person who is an expert on what he does as a job , gets respect in only his field .but this is not a disadvantage for the person because it is an aim which he should have .for example , a plactic surgeon who has mastered in his field , gets more patients .the patients who are satisfied by his work tells his name to their friends and this chain will go on and on .by this , the surgeon will have a good reputation .and this reputation he has will return him by more patients .and the surgeon will be successful in his main aim by working as a surgeon : making money for a living .in my opinion a person must have knowledge in every areas of work , arts , academic subjects etc. to gain respect in social life .but he/she must has to be a master in his area which he does as a job if he wants to gain respect from community .
