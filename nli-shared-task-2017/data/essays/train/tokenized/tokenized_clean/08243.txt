the comparison between the life of two different generations is always difficult , but it is possible to find reasons enough for living in both ages .i think , that the youth has more advantages .first there are physical parameters , such as the use of muscles , which allows young people to do much more than older people .furthermore older people have usually more deseases and are not strong enough to do what ever they want to do .another interesting point is the way of thinking .young people have not to think about money or insurance .they have their mothers , who buy the food , clean their room and their clothes .the only problem for people at this age could be possibly the school , but it weights less if i think about older people , who have to get jobs .older people have to think about money every day because their responsability for their family is extraordinary .a third point is the possability for adults to make what they want .for example they can study what thezbuy what they want .simply they have much more choices than younger people .finally if i could choose , i would like to be young because i like it to do some activities , which i can not do when i become older .
