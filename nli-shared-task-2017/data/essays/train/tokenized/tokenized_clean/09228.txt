i disagree that ` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody  for the following reasons .first , cars are very convenient .no other tranportations can replace them .for example , car has been ` a people s legs  .when i lived in hiroshima , one of the local city of japan , i can not move anywhere without a car .social systems are in the condition people can use a car .additionally , i find it more in the countryside , people can not go to shops without cars .i believe that cars are convenient and have been the tools for living .second , i think that cars will be developed to adjust our life .the features of car can change and can solve the problems .for example , cars comsume a lot of energy and pollute our environments , but now improving their mechanism to reduce bad inpacts .i believe that cars will be developed better in twenty years and will not lose their possition .in conclution , for the reasons mentioned above , i strongly do not believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
