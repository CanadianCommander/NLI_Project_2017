i agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .first , i think the ideas and consepts make the facts .just a fact as it is has no meaning .for example , as for studing history , `` something war  is not important .why they began war , what did the war bring them , is important to study .second , if students understand iedas and consepts , they can possibly make better facts from same ideas and concepts .let s assume that the students studied about ideas and concepts of the cars , some students maight think about other type of viecles .it may grow the imagination of the students .third , if students did nt understand ideas and concepts , they could use facts in the wrong way .it is sometimes dangerous .when i worked in sushi restaurant as a sushi chef , i trained a young lady .she did nt know why we used the rubber globes for cleaning .she touched the detergent by bear hand .then her hand b this is why i think understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students .
