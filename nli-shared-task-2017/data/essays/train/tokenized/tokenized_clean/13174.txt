i feel that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speacialize in one subject .the current era is changing and developing fast .it is growing at a rapid pace and in this changing world , one needs to have information about everything and almost every field .i think that in this changing era , one has to have the knowledge of almost every topic and field .human being is a social animal .he lives in a society where he meets several people from different streams .if he doesnt have any idea about other fields he cant even to talk to the persons he meets .he needs to have knowledge about the various streams .for example mahatama gandhi , a lawyer by profession had a diverse knowledge about various subjects .he was an excellent speaker , great dramatist and a great poet .he used all these skills to guide india to indepence .without the knowledge of these subjects he could not have guidd india to indepence .one must have a broad knowledge of almost every subject .this is not only helpful in professional work , but also important for personal life .for example knowledge of geography can help one plan a vacation to an exotic location .physics is used in our daily lives .chemistry can be really useful to one .one can undersatnd the politics better .one can understand politics better if he has a knowledge of it .i support this opinion that knowledge of many academic subjects is better than knowledge of one specialized subject .
