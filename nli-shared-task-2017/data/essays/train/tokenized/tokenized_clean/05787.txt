i disagree with this statement .i do not think that the helping their communities of the young people is decreasing .that is why i know many students around me tried to attending communities and helping them .for examples , one of my friends attended the community of volunteer for hansensi disease .he went to china and saw the facility with his own eyes .he now also keep trying to help the people who are segregate from the society because of their disease .other friend attend to the community of helping the forign student .once a week , she attend a class with the foregin student and help note taking and assignments .i understand that the student are very busy because of classes , assignments and communication with friends and love .however we can make the time even how hard it is .on the other hand , i think that nowadays there is a problem with communication around the social communities .it is not because of the lack of the time .it is because of the lack of the relationship among the social communities .for my example , i do not know the neigbors .i do not know wether he is student or not .it can be why i stay alone , but it is strange .i think that making the relationship among the social community strong leads to the safety world .if knowing each other very well , the crime is going to smaller .what i mentioned is the young people tried to be aggressive to attending some communities and helping them .however we need more communication among the people of social community .it leads to the safety world .i dissagree with this statement .i do not think not giving enough time to helping their communities .we can make time even how busy we are .the problem is the lack of communication .
