i totally agree with the belief that to have a broad knowledge in many different academic subjects is more valuable than to narrow down in a single subject that you could totally master .there are undoubtedly many advantages to be very focused on a specific subject ; for example many scientific discoveries would not have been found unless there were some people that studied a lot a precise and narrow domain , such as sub-nuclear physics or organic chemistry .nevertheless i think that nowadays a broader culture and education are much more valuable , in order to be a successful in both your career and personal life .a broadly educated person could also contribute much more to the wellness and prosperity of society .an example that comes to my mind is the current debate about bioethics : for the society as a whole it is much more important that we have wellrounded people capable of understanding and debating about the social consequences of human clonation , rather than some scientists that develope the technical method to make it possible .in general i see that the world is becoming really complex and all the jobs require a set of different skills that you can have only with a broad education .that s also why universities all over the world have already begun to offer joint-programs or even truly multi-discliplinary degrees .one example could be bio-engineering , which is the combination of a medical degree and an engineering degree .another example could be the introduction in some mba program of ethics classes : they not only want to educate people to become successful leaders but also want to teach them the consequences of their act in the society , and how to act correctly and by the rules .i think that this focus toward broadness and roundness is part of mankind progress .two centuries ago to be succesfull and happy you only had to learn your job and stick to it for your whole life .nowadays every four years you change job , you maybe move in another country , and you face always new experiences and challenges .in such an enviroment and dinamic situation you are surely better off with a broad knowledge than a deep a specific one on a single domain .
