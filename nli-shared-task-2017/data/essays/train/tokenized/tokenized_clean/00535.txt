the world has witnessed a dramatic increase in population and also the amount of abuse that humanity has done to environment .i feel that there would be a considerable amount of increase in the use of cars in the future .the world undergoes a goelogical cycle inorder to maintain the balance of nature .man has been very instumental in creating an imbalance in nature .in order to create a balance , the world has witnessed unforseen natural calamities which have killed millions of people .the movie , `` the day after tomorrow  has made real sense in showing what would be the state of the world in sometime from now .our natural reserves are being exploited to their limit .soon we would have none of our natural reserves left .but , technology has made giant leaps in exploring the unknown .we will have to depend on alternate methods of energy to run our automobiles and other equipments .solar power is the best possible example of an alrternate source of energy .battery powered cars have been manufactured which are eco friendly .although fossil fuel consumption would become low , the number of cars would see a dramatic increase .as more number of eco friendly cars are produced , the more affordable would they become .population would as usual continue to rise unless a major catastrophe occurs .cities would grow bigger witnessing a major problem of faster transport due to conjusted roads .industries would have to service more number of people .thereby to increase efficiency , they would have to have a better transport facility .this is to ensure faster delivery of goods .residential colonies would be located in satellite towns far away from the city to ensure better facilities .therefore , cars would be of a major concern .for time to come , i feel that with the current demands of industry and population , cars would be used more than they are being used currently .
