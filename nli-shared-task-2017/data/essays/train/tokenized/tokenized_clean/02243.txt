someone says that the art of advertising it s the art to tranform something you usually do nt even think about into something not only desiderable , but indespensable to fulfill your intimate needs and desires .given that as an assumption , it s easy to understand how ads  experts make use of the finest and more sophisticated techniques to present their products and services to the general public of consumers .it s common sense that `` it s the first impression that counts  .this is even more important when it comes to the market .in particular when the average , not outstanding , characteristics of a product or of a service must face a competitive environment to gain market shares and to build long term trust by their customers .this is why a `` little lie  at first sight is necessary , most of times even accepted and comprehended by the customers , as it is in love affairs .techniques are uncountable and may vary significatively according to the category of product or specific item presented to the public .one of the most used technique is to show a picture of the product which is far more attractive than the product itself .guess who has never been disappointed by the slimmy sandwich that comes out from a mc donald s packaging comparing to the beautiful , inviting and gnammy picture that you can see behind the server while you are waiting in the line ?someone calls them `` sweet lies  or `` innocent lies  , that could be tolerated and accepted if we are still talking about sandwiches or candies but when it comes to products or services that can tremendously affect people s life and health , then it comes the need for a more critical approach to the discussion .in many countries , advertising agencies have developed over the year a code or a set of regulations to discipline the way advertising is conducted .even if these efforts are worthly of support i personally think that the consumers are the final judges and they will determine the success or the failure of a product also according to the gap between how it s presented and how it really is .they say `` lies sometimes are sweater than reality  , probably it s true but we all know that lies have short legs in the end .
