for writing a comment on a statement it is essential that we provide a description of the actual situation first .at this time the automotive industry is one of the biggest industries in the world , combining a great number of globally leading companies like toyota , daimler-chrysler and bmw .the sales figures for cars are still rising , especially in emerging markets like china and india and the forecasts until the next decade do not suggest a shift in this trend .this extreme market growth is the problem for the several problems we are facing today .cars are one of the main reasons for the air pollution in cities and metropolitan areas , infrastructure projects for cars destroy enormous amounts of nature environment and because the car is a vehicle for the individual transport of people , it is not able to deal with the more rapidly increasing world population .newest trends in the sector try to establish alternative fuel technologies like hybrid technology or fuel cells to decrease the amount of emissions a car produces and to give the customer a chance to be independent from high gas prices .in the u.s. the toyota prius is selling excellent and this has got one main reason : the people do not want to use public transportation and favor individual transport methods .this reason is the basement of my personal opinion , that there will not be a significant decrease in the number of used cars in twenty years .no government would accept a development where the very costly infrastructure for cars gets useless .modern and fast public transportation systems are rare and mostly to be find on railways ( ice , tgv , etc. ) , but the accident of the transrapid recently showed that the technology of these new rail-transportation methods is unsafe and not capable of being introduced widely in the world .instead the car will evolve in a way , which will make it suitable for the conditions it will face in the near future .the electronic assistents within the car will be 100 percent responsible for the driving and the car will be navigated on the motorways by satellites .this electronic guided traffic will allow to reduce the spaces between the different cars , providing higher average speed and making it so possible to use the infrastructure at the most efficient way .so there will not be a significant change in the number of cars within the next twenty years , but the car as a transportation vehicle will definetly redefine itself in the near future .
