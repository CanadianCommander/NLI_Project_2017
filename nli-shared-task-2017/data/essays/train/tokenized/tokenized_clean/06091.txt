the development of mass media was the beginning of a new era of avertisement .virtually all companies make use of advertisement using the possibilities given by the new forms of mass media as for example the tv or the internet .i agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first reason for my point of view is economical .given the fact that firms take their decisions on the basis of rationality there has to be an economical icentive for them to invest in advertisement .and so it s quite obvious that the firms intend to increase their sales by the way of advertizement .and the consumers are now buying more from the firm s product for one simple reason .the firm s product seems to them much better than it really is .and the firms knowing this fact make use of this by advertizing .another argument is psychological .i personally have made the experience that the way one consider the value of certain objects is highly influenced by the way that other people talk about these objects .for example , once most of my friends bought a new video game .and whereas i had nt liked this certain game a short time before , from this moment on getting this game seemed to be the most important thing in the world .and this process is now linked to the effects of advertisement , because the advertisement for a lot of products is made by very popular people like a tennis star or show master of an tv show .and this effects how people think about the products .the product seems in most cases much better than it really is .even if advertisement often conveys true information about a product awakening the interest of the people .i believe that there is mostly a strong effect influencing the people in a way , so that there is difference between the true value of a product and the value the people think .and this means that there takes place an alienation of the peoples preferences .and from an economical point of view this ca nt be good for the welfare of the society .
