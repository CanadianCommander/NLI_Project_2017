to a large extent i agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .especially if you are visiting a new country or place where there could be a language problem then having a tour guide is very desirable .i would like to recount an experience i had when my parents and i had gone to australia on a vacation .australia is a very beautiful country and i m fortunate to have visited .we went with a group of twenty people from different locations .all of us started off from a common meeting point .the advantages are that all our flight and hotel reservations were booked in advance so we did not have to bother about getting flight and hotel reservations .the tour guide is trained and are well equipped to solve any problems that arise in course of the journey .all local transport was arranged for in advance so getting from point to point is not a problem .an itenary of the places of interest that we would be visiting on a particular day is handed out so we know where we are going and what we are going to see .the disadvantages are that we have to follow a fixed itenary and can not see or visit places not written in the itenary .the other thing is that different people have different tastes , some like visiting museums and places of historical interest while others like amusement parks .irrespective of our likes or dislikes , we have to be together with the group .since we visit as tourists , we donot get to see how day to day life is .finally there is a possibility of not being able to get along with some of the group members .we have to be tolarant towards everyone in the group .i personally feel that the advantages of having a tour guide out weight the disadvantages .these choices are usually dependent on temperment ( s ) of individuals , people who are adventerous may prefer to plan vacations on their own while others may choose a path thats tried and tested .
