with the development of scientice and techonlogy , people pay more attention to the education .in today s society , wether we should learn many subjects or not ?some people thinks that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i agree with this opinion because it can improve and extend prople s knowledge and people should have many interesting subjects to catch up with the development of society .but others do nt think so .the first reason can support my idea is that people acquire more knowledge from different subjects .every body knows that different subjects have a few relationships .when you have trouble in one field , you can change your mind to use distinctive method from another field .if you do nt know other knowledge , you may give up the questions or waste a lot of time to think about it .the second reason is that we should keep up with the development of society .nowadays , many employ need the compound person that have broad knowledge .when the employ fire some person that useless , they will fire the person that have learned one knowledge or skill but learned many skills .for example , if you can speak many kinds of languages , you will find the job better than person that can speak one language .that s the different .otherwise , people that learned one subject have some benefits .such as ,in conclusion , i think that people should learn many academic subjects .because it can extend knowledgr and keep up with the development of society .
