in my opinion it is right that not all but a lot of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it often happens that you see a product for example in a television ad or in a newspaper and that you are disappointed when you have finally bought it .sometimes the advertisement promises more than the product can fulfil .some years ago , in germany for example there have been a lot of advertisement campains for cigarette-brands like `` marlboro  .the advertisement agencies tried to create an image of coolness and an easy lifestyle by using cowboys smoking cigarettes as presentors of this image .but everybody knows that smoking tobacco does nt help to get an easier lifestyle .it causes diseases like cancer .therefore there are governmental restrictions that secure the customer from being betrayed by companies .as a consequence television spots of the cigarette industry are forbidden in europe .it depends on the industry how much exaggeration of the quality of a product is possible .in the car industry for example where a lot of competition exists it is almost impossible to lie about a product .selling cars has a lot to do with trust to the people who sell the cars .when a customer feels betrayed he wo nt return to buy another car .the fact to try to make sure that a product seems better than it really is is just natural .you ca nt criticize advertisement agencies when they try to create a very positive image of the products of their customers because that s just what they are supposed to do .but sometimes it happens that some people just do nt understand the message of a advertising campaign because sometimes they are too creative and the advertising agencies are misunderstood by the customers .but in my opinion this `` creative  advertisement should only be allowed to the point when it does nt mean betraying or liing to a customer .
