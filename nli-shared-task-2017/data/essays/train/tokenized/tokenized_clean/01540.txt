i can not agree .there are many reasons why there will be more cars in twenty years than today .in the follwing , i try to explain three reasons that will have a major impact on the growth rate of personal transportation and therefore on the number of cars in the future .firstly , many poor countries have the potential to develop their economic power and rise the wealth and income throughout the country .china is a good example .the government in china managed to establish more or less substantial laws and condition for prosperity .when people get richer , they often have significant more urges than before .affluent people , or people with a considerable income , want to own cars as prestigious objects .due to all these reasons , it is very likely that especially poor countries will experience a high growth rate in the number of cars .secondly , the production of cars becomes cheaper and cheaper .high end roboters can produce cars in a very cost efficient way because they work very efficiently , quickly and almost perfectly .on the one hand , it is not necessary to pay roboters for their work and on the other hand they can produce 24 hours a day .moreover , engineer s knowledge has accumulated during more than 100 years and they are now able to produce cars that are very cost-efficient in their planing and designing process .thirdly , new technologies make it possible to run cars without emissions .in a few years , cars will no longer consume gaz , but they will need a mixture of water and oxygen .this mixture does not harm the evironment and will be very cheap in the near future .on account of this , care about the environment is no longer a reason the refuse the use of cars .for instance , the car make bmw already runs test cars and even sold them to customers .they run without major complications and are very cost-efficient in their usage and maintencance .
