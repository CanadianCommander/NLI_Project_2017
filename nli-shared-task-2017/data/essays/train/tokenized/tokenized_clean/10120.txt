different people have different views as to how they spend their life and what they weant to persue .as time moves on , these goals and behaviours also change with the mindset and lives of people .it is necessary for people to be able to live their age .for example a high school student s priority would be do excell in his studies and do well in school whereas a businessman s would be to ensure he earns as much money he can .the main difference between the people above in the example is that where one is a sixteen year old kid , the other is a thirty-five year old who probably has a family to support .that does not mean that they live only for those things .they live life the way they are supposed to , accordingly to their responsability .young people comparatively do nt have much to worry about and can enjoy themselves at a discotheque or play sports or what they are able to do .older people can indulge in more ` mature  ways of having fun and enjoying life like watching an ` art  movie or going for a cruise .i personally do not agree with the statement as i feel that it does not take into consideration people s lifestyles .young people can also watch and enjoy art movies if their lifestyle is like that .richard branson the entrepreneur is a major risk-taker and lives life to the fullest .people have their own ways and methods of keeping themsleves satisfied and enjoy life as the feel is right to them .there have been plenty of cases where old people have gone water-skiing , i think that they are really enjoying their life !true there are limitations when it comes to the age-factor , if the biological clock is ticking then one must face it and roll with it .one can not expect an eighty year old to go rock climbing .that same elderly person may enjoy him/her self in the compnay of friends or family .young people dont enjoy life more than older people , they enjoy it differently .
