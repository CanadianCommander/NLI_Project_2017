i agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem mush better than they really are .the first reason is that they are useing the light and many staff to make the products more colorful , freash , and tasty and show to costmors the photo .i had many expriencese about food .when i was living in the domn , i was hungry and lazy to cook by myself then i went market and bought some instant food .on the box , the picture was looks like so nice , but after i went back home and ate .it was so nasty .i just throw it in to trushcan .the second reason is that nowdays every company want to sell their products to costmors to get more money , so no one want to say our products are nt very good .it is meaning they can be honest to costmos .they only think about how to sell even they will cheat on costmors .overall , that is why i belive most advertisements make products seem much better
