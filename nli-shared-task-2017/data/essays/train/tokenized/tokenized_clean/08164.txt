according to me , i would say that both can have benefits according to the situation .in the first part you will see the advantage of a broad knowledge and in the second part you will see how specialize in a specific subject could also be an advantage .the knowledge is the knowing of many subjects , when you have a broad knowlegde you can discuss with anyone about anything .and i think that it is a good point specially when you are in the workplace .imagine that you are specialized in business , and in your firm they don t need salers ( or other jobs in business ) anymore , according to this you wo nt be able to find other jobs in the same company , because you are only specialized in the business subject .in this case , i think it is really essential to have a large knowledge .moreover , they understand it at school because more and more schools propose formations which include various subjects .thanks to this the student or the future worker will be able to face any situation at work or in his private life .in our world today , i think that someone has to be able to discuss or to understand the main academic subjects such as : computer science , business and communication , because i think that they ca nt be understand by someone separetly .but on the other hand , i would like to say that specialize in one specific subject could be an advantage .indeed , if you know well the subject you can be the best .for instance , at work if you are the only one who knows a software you might be indispensable .you can use this to get more money .so i would say that sometimes it s worth knowing something very well than know a litle bit of a lot of thing .
