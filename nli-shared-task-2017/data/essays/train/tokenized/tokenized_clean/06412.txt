capitalism can not survive unless it alters the social reality we are experiencing .this alterance of social reality is most visible in the case of advertisements .in this essay , i will argue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , since advertisements are the facades which are needed in an environment of intense competition .first , i will start with the need of the companies to make advertisements .afterwards , i will give several examples to support my argument .capitalism in our age has produced a society which some thinkers name as `` consumption society  .in this consumption society , even cultural events are mass produced and the proliferation of all kinds of products result in converting reality into an hyperreality , if we may borrow baudrillard s and eco s usages of the term .the masses  experience of hyperreality leaves them in a passified situation exposed to all kinds of advertisements of products .people may do nothing but think that the advertisements are telling the truths about the products whereas they are not .some specific cases will illuminate this point .as a result of globalism , production has shifted mainly to east and south-east asia .many firms making the production by exploiting the labor force in these parts of the world although the consumption of these products mainly occur in the west .for example , all the firms producing ` iron  for ironning , except moulinex and roventa , produce it in china .all !so the production process of different brand-names are the same .therefore , the item that is produced is also the same .just the brand name differs .however , the advertisements manipulate our thoughts in such a way that we think one brand is better than another one , whereas there s no difference at all .another basic example would be one of the advertisements of ` colaturka  .the brand has adopted all kinds of cultural values in order to make it attractive to the turkish population .it has , in fact , succeeded since the sales has increased when colaturka was first available in the market .however , then it has dropped because people comprehended that they were manipulated by the illusion of the advertisements , and , after all , the taste of colaturka was not really good .to sum up what i have put forward thus far , i have to stress several points .the global economy of the world has favored capitalism in producing a consumption society .products and brands have proliferated and since there was serious competition between different brands , advertisements have become the rings to fight .in this war over the products ( which are basically the same since they are produced in the same place or are exposed to similar production processes ) , the advertisements display the item in such a way that people are manipulated towards buying it .there are , of course , exceptions .there are really good products which are advertised in a good way .however , most advertisements make products seem much better than they are because this is the only way of selling the products .
