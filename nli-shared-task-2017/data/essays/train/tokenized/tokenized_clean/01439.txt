it s a difficult question , but i disagree the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .there are two reasons that i disagree with this idea .first reason is about money .if i go to england by the package tour , i would have to pay a lot of money .maybe i will need pay 200,000 yen at least in case of staying london in three days .someone think that paying a lot of money for trip is nutural , because we buy the safty at the same time .however , i m a student now and i ca nt earn a lot of money , so i will go on a trip by myself .in feburary , i went to england with my friends .i bought bording pass by myself and l also booked the hotel by internet by my self .it s easy for me to make a contract .second reason is about the time .if i go on a trip led by a tour guide , i would be able to go to some famous place of sightseeing .however , i must keep the time .i heard that there is nt enough time to enjoy looking at the famous place .it means that i have to hurry to do something , but i do nt need to hurry if i go on a trip by myself .i can enjoy looking the tourist attractions , looking around the shop , eating something until my stomach filled .for these reasons , i disagree with the idea of traveling with a lot of peple led by tour guide .
