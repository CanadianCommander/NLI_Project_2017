today , the advertising sector is the biggest supporter of capitalism .its main purpose is to make the consumers attract the product and buy it .throughout decades , adverstisers are serving their creatibility in the best way to attract consumers .however , they sometimes deviate from this purpose and attract the consumers in an unethical way , which makes the consumer go and buy the product , but then see that he  she is fooled in a mean way .the great competition for production and getting more money is urging the advertisers to be even more deceiving in their advertisements .the producers want to obtain products in the cheapest way , so that they can earn more money and today the quality is not important anymore , the more significant one is the quantity .most advertisements use psychological manipulation as a way of fooling consumers .when the consumers just hear the things they want to hear , the advertisement simply starts to sympathise itself with the consumer and the consumer just wants to go and buy the product .when the consumer faces the sithuation , it is too late , because consumer rights have not been fully developed yet in many countries , and the person may not even contact the company .there is another way inwhich the consumer gets fooled .it is the force of appealing to the authority .as a matter of fact , when a person shows on the advertisement of the most ridiculous product , the sales explode , which is just only a matter of time .for example there has been going on a trend in hollywood , the stars drink water from a brand which serves the normal water that everyone drinks , in a bottle surrounded by diamonds .so a person would feel the most stupid after paying lots of money on that water and when it is finished .to result , advertising happened to be the biggest market of lies , since the need to highlight some products had risen at the corporate world .an honest person has no place in the advertising market , except for being as janitor or the security guard .so vexatious , but that s just what seems to be going in this world .the constant urge for earning money and the greed of humanity has left no trust of consumers to the product , which is very ironic because advertisements can still manipulate and persuade one in the must deepest and the subconscious way just to go out on the market and buy the product .
