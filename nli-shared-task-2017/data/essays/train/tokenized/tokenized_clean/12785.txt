these days , many people are willing to help their communities through many ways such as donating clothings or money , however , some people think that young people appears to be putting little time to help , but i disagree with this statement because of two reasons .initially , since most young people are more active than the older people , i belive that they have better chances to help thier communities .for instance , i saw many young people who are doing voluntary works in schools .they sometimes teach poor people who can not afford to go to college , and also , they teach poor kids , too .also , many young people engage in demonstrations to fight against some unappropriate regulations .from my experience , some of the young teachers tried to change the company that was supplying for my school s meals because the quality of the food was not good enough for students .because of their effort , my school could change the company and had better quality of food for the meals .in addition , i think that the campaigns are mostly launched by young people .for instance , in the church , there are many college students who are helping poor kids around the country by donating cloths .also they convince other people to donate by advertising their campaigns .sometimes they make posters , or they cook cookies by theirselves to advertise it .in the conclusion , i think many young peope are giving enough time to help their communities by several ways such as demonstrating to fingt against some unappropriate rules , voluntary works , and donating for poor people .therefore , i disagree with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
