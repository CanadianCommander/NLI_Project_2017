i completely agree with this statement because ideas can be adapted depending on the circumstances and this adaptability can evolve into a successful result that was expected , so students can have the idea that if all circumstances are optimal , this result will be given .moreover , concepts are also important because they are not orientated to specific details of a situation , but to the general situation , so students can have a good aproximation of the result depending on the interaction of this circumstances .on the other hand , facts can be different depending on the circumstances .the results can vary and therefore it is difficultier to enclose a result .in addition , facts are disputable because they usually occur in systems in which the interaction of different subsystems in that particular time brought that result .but it is possible that the same result can never be repeated again unless the same subsystems interact at the same time and in that precise moment .for example , wal-mart , one of the biggest retailers in the world , sells ideas and concepts to its clients .these ideas have been changing throughout time .sam walton , once a wharton student , stated that ideas and concepts can vary through time , but facts depend on each circumstance that can vary the result interacting with each other .the demand changes constantly and the ideas that once worked for this business are now useless .so students must learn the ideas and concepts that can vary through time and can produce different results other than facts that depend of the interaction of different subsystems .students will then be capable of directing those subsystems and managing them so as to get the desired results and be successful .
