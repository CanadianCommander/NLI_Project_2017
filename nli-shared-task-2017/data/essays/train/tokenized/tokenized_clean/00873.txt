do you agree ?young people enjoy life more than older people do .different people would have different choice .those who support this point hold the opinion that young people virtually have much more pattern to have fun .others who oppose the point , on the contrast , argue that the old people have more spare time enjoy their lives .as far as i am concerned , i literally can not agree more with this opinion , and i will reason and provide concrete evidence to support my viewpoint as follows .the first plaint truth , i am presenting here , is that morden technology provides more opportunities for young people to enjoy life .unfortunatly , older people can use some up-to-date mechines , such as computers .computer is one of the key words of our time .we make use of it not only on the working , but also in our personal life .take me as an example , i literally enjoy surfing on line to find fun .i chat with my friends on the internet , and by the objects i like on line .what s more , my favorate , i play games on line with people all aroud the world .that s cool !but my grandpa , who ca nt use the computer , only watch tv at home for fun .what a pity .furtermore , the young people often sake for some risk activities to colour their lives .for instance , my brother rally enjoys climing mountins with his friends .it s so dangrous to climb an vergin mountin , but he think it can tap his potention , so he like it .but my parents only like the nomal activities , such as playing tennis .last but not least , young people know well about how to relaxe themsevles from the pressure .all the older people know is to work harder and harder to accomplish their job .due to the heavy load of the work , they suffer seriouse physical ailments , it is not worthy to do so .look at the youngs , they know how to relax and how to work effiently .just as what i presented above , they surf on lin and take some risk activities to relax themselves and then go back to work .they find the relaxition really instrumental to their job .obviousiy , the most strinking conclusion is that young people enjoy more than older people do , and i can not agree with it more .
