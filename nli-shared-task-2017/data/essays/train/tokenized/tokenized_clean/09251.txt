the fluently use and buy of the cars is the typical sign of a develop and rich state .infact the more concentration of cars is in the western state .there are many reasons to condivide this opinion .the terrible increasing of pollution is the most important aspects to take in consideration .infact , by this dipend other factors .the problem of pollution we will hold with a production of less dangerosu cars for the envaironment , but the best solution is that increase the pubblic transport like metropolitan , bus , train .if the pubblic transport will be more capillar and efficent , the use of cars can be reduce seriously !one more important reason is justified by the traffic .a lot of cars has been invasion the street : the result is the most dilatation of the time to travel .this problem make more in evidence the problems of pollution and pubblics transport .but i think it s true the opinion of the decreasing of the number of cars , but not in the middle period .infact i think are more less twenty years for change the most complicated abitude of the man .the solution about the some problems already write , can be the use of another type of material different the oil : for example the hydrogen , or sun energy .it s possible that we will have a less percentual of buying cars , but not fewer cars .cities like los angeles are the clear exemple of thousands of people every day victims of the traffic .
