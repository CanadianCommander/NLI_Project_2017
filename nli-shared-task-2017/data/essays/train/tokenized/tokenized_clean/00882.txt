i feel that its always better to understand things and not just mug them up .understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a better understanding of the topic .also if you get to understand it completely it can help you better in understanding of its related topics .you would also be benefited at the time of the examination .understanding helps you a lot for future .if you go for research work later in your life then this understanding of topic would help you to take your research easily .secondly when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistakes on that particular topic .for example , if a doctor dont care to understand concepts about the human body , then in future he would be prone towards doing errors .also he wont become a successfull doctor in future .and by destroying a case he would end himself in prison .so , the example clearly shows how important it is to understand things .we can also take an example of a computer engineer , where every fact and concept about the machine counts a lot .and if he is unable to understand ideas then he would just end up in choas .he would just damage the machine , and we all know how costly these computer machine are .thirdly understanding of ideas in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursue your higher education .for example , the understanding of concepts at bachelor level help you a lot in understanding of the concepts in your masters .however , when it comes to the examinations , when you dont have time to understand concepts its always advisable to learn the facts .at time crises it always better to learn than wasting time in understanding it , because you are never sure that after spending so much time in understanding it , will you really be able to understand it .also at the time of quizzes only learned facts help you win the game , and not the understanding of it .because there are so many things in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concepts , and only option is to learn it .as reinstated in my answer understanding is important , it can not be compared with learning .both have there own standing .
