although older people may enjoy their retirement and have gained a great amount of moneyto spend , i prefer to experience the life as a young persons usually do .in the first place , young people do not have to deal with many illnesses .they are healthy and can spend their life with activities .for example , they join sports clubs or enjoy bungee jumping while older people may have to deal with cancer and have to stay at home or in hospital .second , patterning your further life appear to be an interesting stage of life .as a young adult one decide on studying or making an apprenticeship with a company .this decision-making process affects one s whole future .beside that young people choose a marriage partner and search friends , who they may have contact with the rest of their life .consequently this period is very exciting and requires much engagement ; however , it offers the great opportunity to choose from all the options , which lay in one s ability .third , there probably would never be a time , in which one can so easily make new friends .for example , i as a student met so many different people at university and sustain the possibility to learn from them or experience a whole new culture .i as a student for example have amazing friends from turkey and spain .beside that one can spend time with attending parties and joining clubs offered by university or another organization .finally , young people are mostly only responsible for their own life and can decide on everything without caring about husband , wife or children .this offers a significant background for self-realization .during this beneficial time a student maybe choose to study abroad , an option which will offer both , personal and academic enrichment .consequently , i enjoy being a young person with all options but less responsibility and an interesting freetime
