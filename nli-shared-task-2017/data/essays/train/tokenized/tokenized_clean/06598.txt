i do not really agree with this statement saying that in twenty years the number of cars would have decreased .that does not mean that i object to the goal of reducing the number of cars in the world ; of course , this is a necessary evolution and industrialized and rich countries are currently trying to follow this path .for instance , in paris , the mayor tries for years to prevent people from taking their cars by making the circulation very difficult and by encouraging the creation of new bus lines .he also promotes bikes , having created new roads that can only be used by them .i consider all theses actions as positive actions : it shows that people are eventually aware of the urgency of a change in our attitude towards pollution .we are responsible for the world we are leaving to the next generations and we can no longer live as we do now ( using so many resources ) .but , what seems to contradicts this movement towards a decrease in cars in use , is the situation in developping countries : we can study the case of china .as a matter of fact , china is getting more and more powerful and is now going through this period of industrialization that western countries already experienced a century ago .a part of the chinese population is getting richer and richer and can now afford cars .so when a country of more than one billion inhabitants gets access to car markets , we can imagine that in the years to come , the number of cars is not really going to dwindle .but what can we say ?can we deny them the right to get a car ?to consume after years of being deprived and seeing how it was in western countries ?after all , we did the same before , as we were not concerned about the environmental issue . ..in conclusion , i would say that it is a really difficult question to forsee whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .but it is a tendency that we have to further , especially in poorer countries , by explaining how necessary it is and maybe helping them financially to build public infrastructures that could replace the use of cars .
