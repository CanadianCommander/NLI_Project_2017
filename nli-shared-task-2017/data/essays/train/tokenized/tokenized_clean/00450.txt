it is better to have braod knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i am agree with the above statement because of the following reasons .these days getting job is very competetive .for getting job , surviving in society you need to know lot of things .every where you are using lot of concepts .for example take soft ware engineer .he need to know computer scince , mathematics , english , business logic .if he dont know one of the above , he ca nt grow in that job .nowadays the gap between any two academic subjects is going down .we are using lot of subjects for understanding single subject .consider the example mathematics .recent days for understading mathematics , we need physics , chemistry and some other topics .similarly we are using mathematics for solving lot of problems in phycics , chemistry , space related problems .even we are using mathematics in medicine .similarly every subject used for understanding other subjects .if you have knowledge in single subject , we ca nt under stand recent mathematics .in reasearch , scintists are using lot of concepts for finding one application .for understanding recent research papers single subject knowledge is not sufficiant .take an expamle space programme .in space programme we are using mathematics , statistics , physics , aeronautics etc . ..not only space programme every where we are using lot of subjects .finally for surviving in this competitive world , for doing good reasearch , we need to know lot of concets .for that we need to study lot of academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . .
