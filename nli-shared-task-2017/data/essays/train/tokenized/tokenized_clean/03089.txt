i certianly , disagree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts , as we know that we can not creat a wall without a base .therefore learning the concept and theory behind it is very important .concepts will automatically show the facts in the future .for instance , if i want to learn a new language then i will first learn alphabets .i will learn them to pronunce and even to write .pronucing and writing letter will introduce me the facts of the language .how hard it is to learn ?and how easy it is ?implementing the ideas practically will show you the facts and results .first we will learn what color will be produce when mixing it with the other color .for instance , we will learn in book yellow plus blue turns green .now , in order to learn the fact of this idea we will do it practically and we will find it true .this is how it is important to have an idea before implementing it .after learning principles and theories from books and expertise , we find them in field whether they were true or not .we learn facts through experience and it keeps changing .however , concept does nt change .therefore , it is important for students to learn fundamental skills and basics then start learning fact .
