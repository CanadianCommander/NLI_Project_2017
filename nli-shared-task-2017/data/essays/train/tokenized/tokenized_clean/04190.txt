although many people believe that young people enjoy life more than older pepole do , i disagree with this statement .in the following , i will give three arguments for having this opinion .first of all , i want to mention that many older people are retired .that means that they can organize their pastime as they like to .they are able to do a lot of activities for which they probably did nt have enough time while working .usually , many older people spend their time travelling around the world , learning a new language or an instrument , or are just relaxing .my grandmother , for instance , enjoys her life in the summers by going to a lake every day .she loves to be in the nature , to watch the birds and to swim in the lake .another point is that many older people already made a lot of experiences in their life .they will probably not have the feeling like younger people do that they could miss something in daily life .they are surrounded by kind of a quiet mood and can totally concentrate on enjoying life .younger people , by contrast , always feel the pressure and stress that should become successful to be able to enjoy their life later on .the pressure might be caused by the expectations of the educational system or by the comparison to the older people , often parents or grand-parents , who were already successful in the past .finally , older people are often happy abouth small things in life .they often do nt need a lot of material comfort .they rather appreciate that they can still walk around , that they are of good health or that they have a family they can talk to .my grand-parents , for example , do nt have a car .thus , they do nt have to worry about higher gas prices .in conclusion , i want to stress that older people are definitely able to enjoy life the same as younger people do .they just do it in another way which might be hard for younger people to accept .
