some people think that its more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .i think thats something true .i think knowing the main idea about something is very important .it is useless knowing the fact without knowing the idea or the concept .having the knowledge of something is different .understanding the main points of thing and getting the concepts of them will get you to a point where they will be usable when you need them .having the idea of something makes that information usefull and gives it a value .because it means that something which has been learned , but not just taken in memory because of your teacher says you have to .getting the concept of something will be better because if the teacher asks you something about it and if you have only improved the result or the fact of it , it is quiate impossible for you to answer the question .for example if you know the fact that the light will be on when you push the button , thats ok .but if the teacher asks you why , it s useless knowing the fact .if you would have improved the main idea of light than it wont be a problem for you .never the less , having the knowledge of something will show you the facts eather way .it is very important for you to understand the concept or the idea of something .if you understand it , that means you can also understand the facts and the solutions of it .for example , if you know how the light works that means the you can also permit the fact .if you take a shower with a hair drier which is already on , its likely for you to burn .its all about knowing the main idea and getting the concept of it .in conclusion , understanding ideas and conceps is far better than learning facts because knowing the main idea is very important and having the idea of something will show you the facts anyway .at schools , the teachers should try to make clear the ideas but not only the facts to students .
