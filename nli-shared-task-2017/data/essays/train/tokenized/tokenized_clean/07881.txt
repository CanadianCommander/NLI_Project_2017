it is difficult to say that whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not .if you ask to me , i prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons .according to me , having wide broad knowledge about several topics helps you to be more social , to compete in bussiness environment and to aware yourself in your field of study .first of all , in my opinion , if you have more knowledge on many subjects then you could easily get friends .you would not have difficulty to talk with a new person .consider that you meet someone who is computer science student in a party and you know something about satellites .all right !this is a great change to start a conversation if you like to talk him or her .secondly , bussiness life becoming more and more competitive today .how much topic do you know is more important than how detail in one topic dou you know nowadays .bosses prefer to hire a person who have several experiences on many topics .if you look at job offerings today , you will see a long list of expected knowledge .it departments are example to this situation .although a person is hired to development department of it , it is expected from him to know about security , database sytems or something else .in addition to the second reason , i think that if you have broader knowledge , you could easy change your field of study .if you dont want to work on database systems , you could work on security systems .thirdly , i you have broad knowledge , you will know where you are and you can test yourself that you exactly want this field of study .do you exactly want to study in art or study in geology ?if you know a little bit knowledge about other fileds then you feel comfortable with your choice .in conclusion , my choice about this topic is to have broad knowledge on many academic topics .
