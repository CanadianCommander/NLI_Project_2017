there are a lot of arguments in our days which tend to warn us that cars will be fewer in twenty years .cars were build in order to facilitate for people their transportation but will it stay for ever ?first of all the main factor that makes us believe that cars will be fewer in twenty years is the unbelievable speed of the growing rate of the population .it is becoming bigger and bigger .just imagine if six billion people have a car where could we find a place to park our car ?if in our days we are facing huge problems of traffic what would it be like in twenty years ?in our days the governments decided to build metro stations located in the underground and they decided to increase the number of buses in order to resolve several issues concerning the parking and the traffic .they are trying to encourage the people to use different sort of transportations especially the metro by decresing the prices and by doing it faster .by following the same ideas , the japanese and the chinese government decided to encourage their people to use bikes which are symbolic to them .second of all there is another problem which is the pollution which is destroying our environment day after day .the petrol is being extinct .some studies estimated that in a period of fifty years it will disappear .that s why the countries are building eoliennes onshores and offshores in order to use the force of the wind in order to converte it into a mechanical force .several car companies had the idea to build cars that needs electricity and not gas .but unfortunatly the population and the lack of place does nt help the compagnies to find a logical solution that could hopefully resolve all these problems generated by cars
