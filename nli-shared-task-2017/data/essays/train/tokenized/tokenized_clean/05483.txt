in my opinion , the term ` enjoyement  is very subjective .it is a state of mind which may be experienced both by the young and the aged .to the youth , ` enjoyment  could refer to socialising with their friends , partying , watching movies , adventure sports such as scuba diving .whereas , to an old couple , enjoyment couls imply relaxing at home , spending time with family , taking vacations or simply spending time at an aromatherapy spa .so to take a stand on which age group ` enjoys  life more is rather difficult .however , if we define ` enjoyment  as the feeling of experiencing the ` high  of life , of taking full advantages of all the opportunities available to us today , then i believe , it is the youth which has more of an advantage .the most important advantage that the younger people have is their health .not to say that older people are always sick , younger people tend to be fitter , healthier and more energetic so as to be able to avail of more pleasures of life .lets take for instance the example of scuba diving or trecking .it is most likely that a yound person would be much fitter to enjoy such activities .there are many cases where older people are not even allowed to participate in activites on account of risk of heart failure , unfavorable atmospheric conditions ( para gliding ) etc .however , many old people are fit to underatke these risks , they are generally advised not to .moreover , the youth has a zest for life which is not very often seen in the older generation .this is not to say that the aged dont appreciate life , it is just that the youth has more to look forward to than the elderly .what is unknown , always entices .to elaborate , the young look forward to all the things that are in store for them for e.g graduating , going to college , taking vacations with their friends , travelling the world .while on the other hand , the aged have alreday been through the various stages of life and are not particularly excited about the future .infact most of them are more involved in the lives and problems of their children who are busy ` enjoying  life .as one grows older , the weight on responsibility on ones shoulder increases .it is not possible for older people to take the same kind of risks the youth can take , may it be health-related , family related of even financial .let us consider the case of a graduate student and an old man who has a family of five .the student is more likely to splurge his money on enjomnet activities such as partying , membership os sports clubs , travelling than a man who needs to save his money in order to support his family .thus it leads us to the conclusion that , younger people have fewer financial restraints than older who need to support their familiesto conclude , it can be reiterated that ` enjoyment  is an highly subjective term and may mean different things to different age groups .though our strict definition of ` enjoyment  does bring to light the facts that younger people ahve more time , money and energy to spend on enjoyment activities , the argument is in now way insulated from exceptions .exceptions are always there is every walk of life and so there might always older people who ` enjoy  life more than the youth .
