advertisement has got a great influence on society today .everywhere you can read : `` buy our product as it is better than the other ones .companies try to make the people buy their product to gain more and more money .as far as i am concerned , i think , most of the products which are advertised for are not as good as the advertisement promised they are .first of all you have to ask yourself why the companies advertise thier products .the answer is not really difficult .the only thing a company cares about is how much money the owner or the management of this company will receive at the end .but for being able to sell a product they have to made this product popular and well-known in the population .they have to build up certain image of this product which has to be rather positive .otherwise they would fail to achive their aims of higher and higher wages .to achieve these aims they have to opt for advertising their product in a positive way and it does not matter how good the quality of a product really is .the opel company serves as a good example here .the opel company always advertised its automobiles as being the best car among the others and that you will never get problems with this car .but this was only a trick to make more people to buy their cars .so there are more and more products which has got a quite good advertisement but in real only a poor quality .in the end companies acting in this way cheat on the persons who buy these products .however , i think there are some possiblities to take an advantage of this situation of decreasing honesty in advertisement .companies which do not try to cheat on customers and submit that their product just have the ability and qualitiy it really has the customer will thank the company for its honest advertisement and eventuelly buy more of the company s products .but now both , company and customer have got advantages of this solution .
