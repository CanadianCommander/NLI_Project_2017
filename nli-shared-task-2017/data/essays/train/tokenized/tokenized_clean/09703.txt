the quality of a people s education and principles therein is measured in different ways .germany for example is still a country very much influenced by the ideal of humanistic teaching principles conveighed by and kept alive almost since ancient times , when scholarly education was a matter of academies and reknown schools of thought .it seems that german non-universitarian education for high school students is still strictly modelled after this old idea .therefore high school schedules in germany include - or rather cram in ?- many subjects .as soon as a student reaches university or college level he finds himself quickly forced into making his first own educational choices for which - due to the lack of previous experience - he might not be ready .there seems to be a great disproportion in what is considered important knowledge , everyone should have access to and in the understanding of what a true academic really is .when it comes to universities academics are people highly specialized in their subjects .german universities praise their specialists .of course , the people displaying knowledge or even expertise in several subjects are often highly praized but they are rare and getting rarer by the generations of students .so much focus is put on the early specialization of the mind that the broad and not necessarily deep level of knowlegde is completely underestimated , whereas exactly this level actually makes people accessible and grants them lightness and fluency of conversation with many different people of - again - many different - social , intellectual etc. - levels .unfortunately , education has become strongly influenced by trends of all kinds .i am especially referring to the growing interest in economic studies rather than the humanities , including philosophy .myself having enjoyed substantial training in the classics - latin , greek and hebrew - i only want to speak for the advancement of the broadly educated individual .the earlier a specialization takes place the earlier a mind is locked-down and fixed .in order to determine the best use and combination of one s interests as well as capabilities one has to be as free as possible for as long as possible .i fear that specialization drains the individual early of its creative energies and serves as a uniformer to knowledge in general .
