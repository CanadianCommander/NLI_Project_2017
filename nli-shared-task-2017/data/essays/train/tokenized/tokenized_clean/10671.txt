i agree with the statement that people will tend to use cars less than nowadays in twenty years .firstly , more developed transportation than car will be made .moreover , people do nt need to move like nowadays since through the internet they will be able to handle their works without directly moving with their cars .first of all , the new transportation will be made which is much more environmental friendly than cars in thesedays .nowadays , cars seriously cause the environmental problems .because of the gas released by car , it bring about the destroy of ozone layer .furthermore , the increasing use of fuel cuases the human to hardly find energy resources .people living on the earth have problem which cars influence on our nature environment .thus more developed transportation will be made to preserve the nature .next , there would be little chacec for people to move with their vehicles to manage their works .as the internet grow , people can do their works conviniently .they do nt have to move much to meet somenone or see the situation directly .intead , they can meet people on the internet even seeing each other by screen and have talk .also , they handle their work by getting the material by the internet just on their desks .this developing of internet cause people no need to move somewhere anymore .it can make the less uses of cars .for these following reasons , cars are no more significant tools for future people .first , more eco-friendly transportation will be made , moreover the less people use their cars becuase of huge developement of the internet .that s why the use of cars would be decrease in 20 years .
