some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in my opinion , i think it is good for a person to have a background in many subjects .however , he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job .each person should has one specialized subject .a doctor can not be a civil engineering at the same time .there are many reasons why i think specialization in knowledge is better .first , every society must consist of people that have knowleges about different subjects .as the human body contains different members that work independently and consistently , the society needs individuals with different jobs and ways of thinking .in addition , people are different in what they are interested in and we can not find a person who interested in all academic subjects .for example , i like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother s interests are just the opposite of mine .besides , human brain is limited and a person can not be creative in many fields .this century is not like the past when one scintist , like newton , was shining in physics and mathematics .as we have noticed , societies must consists of people of different knowleges and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic fields .therefore , i disagree with the idea which says that it is better to study many academic courses than to specialize in one specific field .
