knowledge is power .i feel that we are in the period of the knowledge explosion .i strongly feel that is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects because they enhance our quality of life , increase scope to move around and experiment with different jobs and we get to meet people .it increases our employment chances , thereby brings in a lot of life , vitality and adventure into life .i would like to give an example .my sister has studied law , political sceince , literature and has taken computer courses too .ihough it was tough for her to coup with so many different subjects with different natures , now it is paying her a lot .for her majors , she had gone to the usa for her majors in law .with her knowledge in many subjects , she is succesful in life .i mean she is happy with her decisions and now enjoying the life doing the job of her choice .another friend of mine was only interested in mathamatics .he continued studying mathematics and he is doing the job of alecturer in hyderabad .he is not happy with his job as he is always interested in doing research .but his family responsibilities and committments prevent him from doing so .he is forced to do his job .he comes to us and feels sorry for choosing only subject because it is not helping even to do parttime job and earn .therefore i strongly feel and suggest to people to study as many subjects as possible and increase their knowledge .
