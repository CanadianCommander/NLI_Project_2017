i agree with this statement .advertaisement is taking an important place in the decision to buy for a customer .i think that this fact is thanks to the popularity of television .spots are becoming more and more frequently and they continuosly influence who is whatching television .moreover , we can see advertaisement everywhere : on the bus , on the walls of underground , in the newspeapers . ..thanks to all these reasons , companies are developing the sector of advertisement , becouse in this way they can reach the costumers and so they have more chance to sell products .also this tendence is effective to know how the people is influenced by advertise and how is necessary showing a product in the best way .sometimes the firms presents a product describing all its properties , in particular all its qualities .but they put particular attention in hidding the negative characteristic becouse these are a sort of negative advertaisement .in order to show goods desiderable and amazing they try to invent some good qualities and in this way they make a product much better than it really is .as far as i am concerned i think that this false advertisement is a negative aspect of the business of ours days .companies should do everything in order to sell their products , sometimes they even lie , that is orrible becouse they do nt garantee the costumer .when i want to buy something for me or especially for a present , i put all my attention in what i am buying , and a logical consquence is that i buy something that is famous , that is trendy .infact too not make any mistake i prefer to buy a product with a good brendt , that probabily should be better than one that is unknown .furthermore the brendt should give to the costumer sure characteristics , as good material for a dress , or good ingredients for a food .thus a direct consequence of this false advertaisement , according to me , is the increasing of product of a famous brendt that are more expensive and the small success of normal products .
