indeed , advertissement is one of the best ways to reach people .but some advertissements seem the most time much better than they are really are .in my opinoin , i agree with this statement for theses two reasons : the use of very good commercials and also the use of the celebrities persons in the commercial .first of all , many advertisements have a really good commercials which can convince the people. , like one of the biggest problems in the usa is obesity , many of thoses commercials which want a sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as htey will get this product they might looklike this person .for example the increase of the production of numerous medicines to loose weight in this contry is a proof that is works but at the same time the usa still one of most important contry which has problem with weight .second of all , ther is a huge use of celebrities in the advertissements that gives a false image of what a product is really is .for instance , the last campaing of proactiv solution which is suppose to help to relieve acne .personnaly , i love jessica simpson who is a singer and actress .so when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol uses this  it might works for me too .so  i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change like i tought .thus , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more products look better than they are really are .people should start to stop believe in those advertissements at hundred percent because sometimes it can work and sometimes it might not .
