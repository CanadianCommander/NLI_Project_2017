i am in the agreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older eople do .when young , every individual has the energy , zeal , passion and strength to enjoy the life .its the exuberance of youth that always motivates one towars more colorful side of life and thats what lack in the older people .in the age of teen , every individual has a desire to experience the life to the fullest .he aims high to achieve his goals .he studies hard to get into a good university .after getting enrolled , he plans well and again studies hard with great perseverance to get a good score and finally a degree that will provide him the platform to move further ahead in life .after he gets a satisfactory job or starts some business , he wants to settle in life with a loving and caring spouse .taking responsibilities and standing by them gives him the immense pleasure of being successful .so he is always in process of making life better .when he is 30 to 35 , he plans for his kids , their schooling , their upbringing in a better environment .and as the time passes he becomes weak and old , not strong enough to take care of his family .rather he becomes dependent on his children for his small needs .surrounded with health troublems , he rarely get anytime for enjoyment .but not neglecting those special exceptional cases that justifies the quote `` your age is what you feel  .a well planned and organised life can definitely expircate the weekness of oldage .neglecting the negatives aspects of oldage , if one loks towards the postive facade , its the oldage that makes the life complete .older people do enjoy life with their grandkids , friends , betterhalves , livelyness of the gardens in which they stroll and many more .
