i am agree with the statement .i think that people should make differents things to make this planet a better one .what i mean is that much people do not like to do a big effort , but who really like that ?we need to start taking risks to be success .working with an own bussines you can feel better , because you are working for you and not for another persons who maybe you will never know .you can research something and then bring put it on the market .i have some friends working by importants firms they like what they do , but i am sure that they will never take a risks because their parents never did .that is a big problem in my country , most of the families educated they childrend to study and work for an international company .in personal i think that they should induced them to create an own bussines .the term `` take risks  maybe is not only for have your own bussines .other example is the university .most of the students after they have finished the high school they do not know which carrier they what to do .of course there are some guys that prefer the money before anything , so they study something which they do not like much but they will earn some money .also they are others whos take the risk of do what they like and after few years they are famous scientifics .who knows the future .in conclusion i will say my childrend do what they really want to do and if they should take a risk do not think twice and take it .i am sure that if we work in something that we really like , we will be a better workers and we will have a better life .
