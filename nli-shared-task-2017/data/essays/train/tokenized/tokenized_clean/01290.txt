i agree that the means and ways of helping in a community has changed , but i totally disagree that young people do not give enough time in helping the community and society in general .a group of people coming together on a shared idea or opinion is called a community .before the advent of the internet persons had to be physically present to be in the community , now is not so .i think that with the expoentational increase by which young users are releasing the benefits of the internet , there is a lot of time to create , expand and cherish the communities .information age has given us more communities then there were any previously .if you just browse yahoo .com and orkut .com , you will find a community already present in which you are intersted .be it on music , software , movies , entertainment , fund rasing and so on .young people not only create these communities but also make sure that they take activate part in it by updating the latest and removing the rest .with the increasing number of users help is assured to be given to the needed .also , in todays world where people are living in high-rise building , i am sure every member from each of the house in the apartment wil come together to form a commitee , to atleast make sure that they know each other .when they come together they also find ways in which to solve each others problems .youngsters who care for the society will make sure that community festivals are held with their utmost diginity .for example the ganesh chaturiti festival in india , there are more young people than old ones and the festival is celebrated with full vigor and enthusiasm .in a typical college environment , there are many communities formed by young people who make sure that many weaker students get the necessary additional help that is needed .communities can only exists if there is a shared interst , but now a days there are so many choices and as young minds changes every now and then we think that they are not helping the community in which they had taken part .
