in some cases , it is said that understanding ideas and concepts is very important than to learn facts .i strongly disagree with the statement for following reasons :firt of all , in many times the student understands ideas and concepts of a subject but he or she can not apply this information to the real life .for example , in law faculty a student learn about a lot of ideas or concepts .he or she read many books about the law .then he or she began to think  i read the many books and learn their concepts and ideas .but whenever he or she graduate the university and come across the real facts he or she realize that there are differences between teorical information and implementation .secondly , if they are in the real life it will be very easy and quickly to learn something than understand adeas and concepts only .for example , before being a lawyer , in the school because they do nt join the case they amazed when they attend the case .
