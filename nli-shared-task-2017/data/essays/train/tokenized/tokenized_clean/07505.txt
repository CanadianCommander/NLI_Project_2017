do young people enjoy life more than older people ?this is a difficult question to answer for anyone , since you lack experience about this when you are young , and often forget how it was before when you are old .still , i will try to give my point of view on the subject .young people have a lot of reason to enjoy life .they are young , healthy , active and their life is still before them .most of the time young people have objectives , and they are planning their life to fullfil them .for exemple , some are looking for the best way to get to the top of their firm , others are planning to marry and have children , etc .in the same time , they have the ability to do exciting and physically demanding activities like sports , extreme or not .from my point of view , being young gives a very positive attitude , and the feeling that nothing is impossible and that with efforts you can achieve whatever you planned .on the contrary , being old is , i think , much more depressing .that is the time where illness begin to spread among people of your age .you do not work anymore , so you have plenty of spare time but you are not healthy enough to plainly enjoy it .you still have objectives , but you begin to think that perhaps you will not have the time to achieve it .all of this is does not give a very positive attitude toward life .as i have clearly explained , i think that most of the time young people enjoy life more than old people do .still , i would like to point out that everything is not as simple as it seems .for exemple , for several years now unemployment has been a great factor of depression for young people .in the meantime , people are living longer every generation , and the progress of medicine keep people healthy until an advanced age .that gives a lot of time to enjoy your free time when you are old , to travel to other countries or to improve in your hobbies , which is very positive .as a conclusion , i would say that i think that being youg gives a more positive attitude to life , but that what matters most is your personnal belief in the good sides of life , and you will enjoy your life whatever your age is .
