education of students is very important so we have to be carefull .some people think understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .however , i disagree with that and i think not only students but also adults must develop themselves with facts .people must be realist ; this makes people more successfull and powerfull .firstly , i think schools should produce more realist peoples and since child had started primary schools this education has been started .realist people can be more successfull as we can see in history .for example , napalyon buenoparte , was inteligent and realist .he has seemed always realist since he born to now .as we can see three of his word ; a person had came to talk with napolyon when he was going the war , and he asked ` why they always do wars !  and he answered ` money , money , money  .i think it is a very good example for a successfull realist person .on the other hand we can see in history failed people who were dreamer .many kominist are very good example for that .they lives for ideas and concepts and they can not do anything for peace or any good things for humanity .however , other people who were realists are all written in history books .as i can see it one picture from my sit when i am writing my essay , ataturk who is the founder of the turkish republic .he was certainly realist because even ottoman empire s dreamer behaviors and force on all people , he behaved realist and established this modern country .he knew where turkey was and where others were , and he tried to develope like other developed country such as europens and americansin conculusion , i think childeren must grow up with facts if they wants to be a successfull person and because of that we must educate them in that way .
