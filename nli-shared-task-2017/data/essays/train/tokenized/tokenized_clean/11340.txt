the demand for cars is rapidly increasing .but in twenty year time , i think there will be fewer cars in use than today .i agree with the idea that the car number will increase in twenty years , and hasve some reasons for agreing .first , the fossil oil based energy sources are dicreasing .it is getting expensive and unefficent to use those resources for the energy supply of transportation .electricity , nuclear energy sources , solar energy and even hydrogen is in consideration for replacing the fossil oil usage .there is also another reason for this replacement which is the air polution that is caused by the fossil oil usage .in order to reduce the polution governments are limiting the gasoline types and quality used in cars .that also rises the price .not only the fossil oil reserves but also the iron , steel and other metal reserves are forcing us to use our resources more carefuly and more logical for our future .we should understand that these natural resources are limited .considering the population growth , and the sizes the big city s reach , it is possible to understand the need of a special way of transportation : public transport .the trafic jams , the time consume rides are causing caos , trafic accidents , polution in the citys .because of these results of personal transportation solutions , annual expenditure of the economies are increasing constantly .this is not a weight every economy could handle .i think the public transportain , especially the rail usage has to increase to handle these problems .fossil oil energy sources could be used more efficiently and harmless in different areas of the industry .more enviorement friendly and economic solutions has to be found and used for transportatin problems .the car companies are working on the alternative energy usage for the future to substain their companies .some big companies buy the other companies to reduce the competition and some others have merged .this could be analyze to understand the sector s future characteristics .i think the shrinking market conditions force car companies to fight harder to survive .with all these signs , i think in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today .
