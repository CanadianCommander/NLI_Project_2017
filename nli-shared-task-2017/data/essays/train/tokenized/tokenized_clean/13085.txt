you often see old people on the street who are either angry , annoyed or very sad .by contrast most of the young people i know are very cheerful and relaxed .apparently , most of the young people are much happier than older ones .therefore , i personally believe that young people enjoy their lives more than older people .evidently , older people have more maladies and painful physical problems .the body gets weaker when you become older and often causes horrible pains .generally speaking , children and younger people are healthier and consequntly fitter .my grandfather for instance , had belly cancer and therefore did nt relish eating anymore .being traumatized by horrible memories , many old people get more and more depressed in their old age .this causes difficulties that force old people to renounce many pleasures in life .for example , it becomes more and more difficult to travel .in addition , younger people still have a lot of wishes and ideas of what they want to accomplish and experience in life .whereas old people tend to be frustrated because there is nothing new to discover .they have experienced nearly everything in life and do nt have any future plans .young boys and girls can look forward and are still full of hope , whereas older people must look backward .in conclusion , i personlly believe that it is much easier to be happy when you are young .on the one hand , being young and fresh normally leads to a happier life because the body is generally fitter and painless .on the other hand , a child or teenager still has the opportunity to discover many things in life .given all of these reasons , i recommend everyone to learn and experience as many things as possiple during his youth , since for most of the pleasures in life it will be too late one day
