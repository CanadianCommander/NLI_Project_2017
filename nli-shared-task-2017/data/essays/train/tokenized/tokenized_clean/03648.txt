it is debatable that what is the better choice between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialize in one specific subject .some people say learning about many academic subjects is more useful for their life because the more we learn , the more we can use during our lives .however , i disagree that opinion because there is no enough time to study on specific subject perfectly and studying many things has no use in society .our lives are too short to study one specific subjects .if we learn about all of things , we can get only a few knowledges from them .for example , when i was young , i has interests in piano , art , and taekwondo .i learned those of things in same time , but now i have no much skill in all of them .today , i have a regret because if i had chose one thing among them , i could have one professional skill to show my ability to the people .so , we have to concentrate on one specific subjects for more efficiency .in conclusion ,
