it is widely believed that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .it is widley belived and we all know that the wider the beliefs can not be the truths all the time .this is one such instance .it is a popular notion because we , the most people , associate enjoyment with physical activity .as the old people can not move fastly or most of the time they are confined to a place we tend to believe that they are not enjoying .it is because we start comparing ourselves with them .and it is even strengthened by `` young-ones - play-old-see  .but the argument holds no water at all .because , enjoyment is not a mere activity of jumping around or moving vigorously .it is more than that .most old one may not play the foot ball but they enjoy a lot seeing the young ones playing .like we do watching foot ball on the tv .we are not on the national sides or clubs but we do enjoy the success of the our favorite club star .are nt we enjoying the success of our `` rolemodel  .yes we do .like us they do .enjoyment has a lot do to with meantal activity , how one perceives the things and he takes them into his / her stride .for example , take the instance of my neighbouring old couple they enjoy a lot by reading novels , watching tv , listening music , oh !that envious cosy evening walks .when asked about it their comment was in unision `` we are enjoying like never before  .reason was simple when they were young they never had that leisure time .they were either busy with the jobs or raising their children .can anybody dare say its not enjoyment .another similar instance is my own grandfather enjoys a lot by catching up with his old friends .whcih he could nt do when he was young because of his packed schedule .another great example is my grandfather enjoys , may be defeating me , hands down most of the time , chess as much as i do .even the research has come out with the great findings that are `` happier ones live long  .on the lighter side , they do nt have exams to write big problem to the so called enjoying young ones .enjoyment is all in the mind not the body , it has to do with mental activity rather than physical activity .its how one feels not others .
