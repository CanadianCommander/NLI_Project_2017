i could imagine that this statement might become true .several reasons lead me to this conclusion .first , in the future jobs in agriculture will be replaced by more technology .as a consequence the people will move into towns .there are trams , subways and buses , so a car is no longer needed .second , in future times will be ( hopefully ) more conservation .people will try to reduce emissions , so they will share buses and will use trains .i could imagine that globalization will contribute to a reduction of cars , too .a better connection of cities , countries and continents will be neccessary .more flights , for example , will exist .because i live in germany , let s look at my country .if i live in berlin and have to work in munich , i have the choice to go by train , plane or car .the advantage of the car is that there is no specific time when i have to start from berlin , i can decide on my own .today , the plane and the train have fix times of departure .the disadvantage of the car is the long traveling time .but imagine , in the future more and more people have to travel between berlin and munich because of the globalization .much more trains and planes will be .then there will no longer be the question `` will i go by plane/train or by car ?  because it simply takes too long .as you can see , here the car is replaced , too .another reason for fewer cars might be a raise of working time .in the future people propably have to work more than today , so they will have less leisure time .a a result they will have less time to drive out of the city to see the nature , for example .a car is not neccessary any more , because in town they will , as already mentioned , have trains and buses .in conclusion i can say that i can imagine very well that there will be fewer cars in use in future and i really do hope so because then there would be less emission which contibute to the depletion of the ozon layer .
