it is reported that the number of cars has been increased for past ten years .in some cities , persons not having cars are regarded as to be even strange .however , i strongly agree that in the future less cars will be used because of their bad effects on environment and other transportion .to begin with , current used cars have many drawbacks .first of all , the environment has been polluted by cars .the harmful gas from cars causes respitory diseases .on top of that , the gas results in globla warming .this is why governments regulates sales of cars .for instance , in many contries , bicycles are encouraged to use for going near place in stead of using cars , and in korea , a person who have over three cars should pay tax as six times much as a person having only one car .moreover , annually , an uncountable number of serious car accidents break out .this prevents many people from using cars .in addition , in the future many better transportation ways or vehicles will appear .already , airplanes and express trains are widely used thanks to their fastness .the need of them has been increasing becasue moder people consider time important .for example , in korea , my countrary .an express traine was introduced about three years ago .because of it convenience , usually , people choose it for going to busan from seoul .the fees of it is less expensive than the fee of gase for a car .in addition , engineers are inventing new transportation by using the state-of-art technology such as magnetic floating train .it is expected these new transportation wil appear soon ,in a nut shell , i strongly believe that fewer cars will be used in twenty years .a car is too dangerous to the environment as well as human .we will be able to use more convenient and fast transportation .
