success is one of the courages that make people to take risks in the different layer of the life .i believe that sucessful people try new things and take risks more easily comparision to the unsuccessful people .according to my view success encourages people and make people to handle the hardships of the new subjects or the areas that they are going to face with .for example paris hilton , one of the sucessful person in the world .she is not an actress , singer or movie maker but she takes place different part of the art .in each part ` she becomes sucessful .she is very popular for now .she has a single and people like her voice then she decided to be an actress .if she does not sucessful in the music sector , she can not decide to be actress to act in a movie .but opposite to the paris hilton , bill gates who is the one of the sucessful person in the computer enginnering area , .he can not handle risks without calculating .thereby it does not always seems that every sucessful people try new things , some of them may choose only doing what they are already know how to do well .we might acknowledge that success make people to believe themselves .each successful job make them to believe that they are always taking right decisions but i think it is only a belief .for example , arthur triumpth who is the owner of one of the biggest reat estate companies in usa .but in the history he faced with very serious economical problems due to being a risk taker .after real state business he has choosen to build a casiono and tries to manage it .but he did not take a toughtful considiration about what might be happened and he had bankrupcy .consequently , success is one of the catolizer of life that lead us having chance to take risks .unless we take the risks we can not figure out the areas that we are capiable of .may be success make us to concieve of about our choices .the examples that are given above show that successful people are the pinooers for new things and lover of risk .
