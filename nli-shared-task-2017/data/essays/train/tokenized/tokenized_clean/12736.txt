tycoons are famous examples of persons who embody success .however , people might become successful because they took some risks and achieved something new , whereas others are successful in repeating perfectly something already existing .i think that success is bound with innovation and that doing something already known is less impressive .in science or technology , many scientists became successful because they discovered or invented something new .indeed , taking risks is similar to not following a commonplace guidance .for bill gates found success in creating the first computers .another example is alfred nobel , who took huge physical risks in order to secure and then product dynamite .successful people are visionaries .in art , innovation often benefits inventing artists .howard hugues , an american tycoon , became famous because he dared to shot the most expensive movie ever made , and he broke many records in airplane history .on the other hand , taking risks is not always followed by personnal success .success only happens when a majority of people acknowledge that someone did something outstanding .for example , nicolas copernic asserted that the earth was moving around the sun , and not the other way round .even if he was right he did not became successful because no one at that time could believe that theory .howard hugues , though he had great ideas will remain in memories because he failed to output its project of a giant plane .
