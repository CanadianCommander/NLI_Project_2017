sucessful people are innovators and risk takers that has been proved many times in the world history .in any field or area , there are so many examples of great achievers who successed just by trying new things and taking more risk in comparision with common man .i agree with the statement that people who attains goals , achieve sucess do try new and different things and in that way they take more risks .if a person want to be sucessful then he has to try a new thing simply because if he continues to do what he is doing well then he must be a sucess which he is not .so to get what he wants he has to try a new way or process .if we consider a business and economy then microsoft , gillette , ford and many more are the products which have caused revolution when they were introduced but initially they were the risk taken by their owners .today they are big sucess stories in the world business .in science if a professor or scientist want to invent something then he has to try few things and use new methods , in a way they all are risks .if they keep doing what they were doing before will they get success , surely the answers is negative .there are many disadvantages of trying new things which includes lack of information and knowledge , economic risk and the risk of failure .it is very safe to do what we are doing best and we already know how to do it .there is a saying that contented people can never gain success as they are satisfied with what they are doing .the thing which a person is doing well that was also new when he first started .at the initial stages of the process he was not knowing that he would be doing exceptional in it .but he tried that new thing and now he is doing very well .so one thing is for sure to do well at one thing the new risk has to be taken .for a lot of people , to take a risk is not considered a good thing and i believe that is the main reason that we do nt find too many successful people .we forget that when we started walking , when we learnt driving , all were new things at that time .there was a risk involved also .if we would bot have done that what would have happened .so to get somthing we have to take a risk and we have to try new thing .
