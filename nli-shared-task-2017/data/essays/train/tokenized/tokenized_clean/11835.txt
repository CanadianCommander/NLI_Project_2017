some people says that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , on the other hand someone says that for a student is more important to learn facts and not to understand ideas and concept .the fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , because facts can be consider a logical conseguence of the ideas and the concept , and if a student understand the ideas and the concept he can learn fact easylier and quicklier .the second says that for a student is more important to learn a fact and not to understand ideas and concept , because the history is do by the fact and not by the ideas or the concept .as far as i m concerned , i perfectly agree with rason of the second group of people , in fact i think that for a student is more important to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and comcepts , because in my opinion facts is the application of ideas and conception , and if a student learn facts he has more help to understand the concepts .for example if i must study the second world war for me is more important learn facts and not what ideas or what concepts there are under the facts .for example if i study the german s invasion of poland i learn the fact , but from this fact i can understand that the nazism s project is to conquist all the world and this project starts from the poland .finally i think that a student must learn the fact because from fact he understands the ideas and the concepts that there are under the facts and not more important in the history text for example the question is about the fact and not about the ideas , this is only an example , but it is another reason for me that is more important to learn facts .
