i like listen to my father s story about his friend .he has own company and succeed , but i think his personality is kind of strange , in other word , he is an adventourous person .he likes to go different places and buy new things .i thought he is a just rich person and wastes his money for fun ; however , my thought was wrong .he is experiencing new things and planning what is next his project .from my experience , i believe that successful people try new things and take risks .trying new things gives new idea while they are doing .if people don not try new things , they can not have creative or intersting ideas .i think that from several experiences we can extend our knowledege and perspective wildly .successful people go to a lot of different places and experince ; therefore , they can inspire new ideas .taking risks might be big damege , but from risk , people can learn what is a problem or weakness .somethimes people need to fail from something because they can notice what is it wrong , but if they keep their rotuine and not try anything , they even can not see new solution or ideas .for example , reserching costs a large amount of money , especially abroad , but this can be big asset after they success .so , people should not to afraid so much to take risks .successful people have interesting personality .if people are doing the same things , their brain would be hard and can not see other possiblities like stubborn .in conclusion , i think that when people are success , they are interesting and intelligent people because of their challenge : trying new things , not being afraid of taking risks .so , i think that thier careea reflects their personality like enjoyable and rich personality .
