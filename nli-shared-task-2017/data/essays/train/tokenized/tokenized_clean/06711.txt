i agree that successful people try new things more important .i think someone who have desire about success are not satisfied one thing .they seek another things , that is more attractive things .successful people have an endless energy about doing something .so , they do not like a safety position .they think that staying in a comfortable situation is dead , which makes them study many things .for example , scientists discover many things .even though they earned much money from one project , they do not enyoy the money .they get courage about doing something and proceed forward .they find new things every day .i think someone who have power about things are received from god .they are borned with the nature .i like edison because he has not been edcated , but he did not stop studying something .as a result , he became the father of science .he invented many important , realistic , and useful things .in spite of his successing , he invented another things continuously .in my opinion , sucessful people like better a risk , adveventurous things , .that is , thers is no satisfy .so they work for new things .
