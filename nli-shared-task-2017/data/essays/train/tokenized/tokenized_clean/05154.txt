i would agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do .i believe that younger people are usually less burdened with the hardships and stress of life , that come at a later stage .also , younger people have an attitude to not take things too seriously and so , they tend to enjoy life in more situations .further , older people usually lose out the patience to enjoy and experience adventures and fun in life like the way youngsters do .when we take the example of an old man , who becomes weak due to age , its very obvoius that he does not have the stamina to enjoy any adventures in life .also , he would tend to become more subdued and mellow .in drast contrast , a youngster is usually filled up lot of energy and enthusiasm to take on new tasks , adventures , visit interesting places and so on .also , younger people tend to hang out a lot with friends and share lot of fun moments together .for example , if a young couple were to make a pleasure trip , and an old couple comes along too , it is highly possible that their views and sense of fun would nt match .the older couple will usually prefer to stay indoors even while on tours , whereas the younger couple , i believe , will explore the place , in and out .i remember an incident when i had to go out on a tour alone , and i asked my grand mother to accompany me .she just did not want to go with me .she said she would get exhausted and does nt take interest in travelling anymore .when i asked the same to a friend of mine , she immediately obliged !this shows the clear contrast between the views of an old person and a young one .i believe that we all usually get a matured and proper understanding of life only after facing some serious troubles .this kind of a view develops over time , and can not be seen among the youngsters .youth therefore symbolizes more of energy , idealism , innocence , etc .adding to all the above mentioned reasons , i feel that maybe biologically also , younger people have higher levels of adrenalin , which expels higher levels of energy .this can further explain why youngsters tend to enjoy life more than their older counterparts do .however , i admit that the same youth will eventually turn out more matured and get more serious about things , and fall in the categoty of old people .
