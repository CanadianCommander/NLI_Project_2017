some people say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject , however i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .there are two reasons why i agree with this statement .for the first reason , when people go to the foreign counturies , people always face to the situation to give an information about their native country .for example , if a person is very specialize in the economics in japan in 1950s , this person is able to explain how the japanese developed their industry since then and other people are able to understand why the development of the industry was significant for the japanese society , however , the problem is that there is a hidden process that the development of the industry brought the serious pollution problems to the japanese citizens .if the people only focus on the history in this case and do nt know anything about the environmental affect on the japanese citizens in today by the industliarization in 1950s , other countries would understand about the history in japan but not able to understand completely about other important factors occuring in japan .for the second reason , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , it could help a lot of people in the society .for example , in recent years , the population of the indians are significantly increasing and if it doubled in the future time , they are not able to manage to get all food supply and service from the workers and the government .however , if people are able to see this problem historically , economically and environmentally , people are able to come up with the idea to carry out the significant treatment , it encourages many indians to get food supply and service and more number of people are able to survive as long as possible .as a conclusion from the above statements , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to inform other people to understand a particular thing in many point of views and it encourages people to find out the way they are able to live comfortably .
