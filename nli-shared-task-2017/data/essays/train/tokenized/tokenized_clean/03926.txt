here the question is about having an broad knowledge about many academic subjects we have learnt or by doing the specialization in a particular subject what we have learnt .i consider doing specilization in a particular subject is mainly necessary .i give some examples why it is so in below paragraphs .i consider specilization in a particular subject is good and necessary because , in a particular acedemics we dont concentrate on all off the subjects .we like only one of the subject .we learn more about the subject if we do specilization in a particular subject .it increases my intrests to learn more about the subject .there is an saying like `` what we have learnt is like a drop in an ocean  .this state ment is true because , we have only learnt some amount .there is lot of thing to learn next .we can do research in a particular field of intrest and learn more about the subject which we can implement in the society which leads to good results .we can also go into the researching field of our intrest and into the teaching field by showing our intrests towards our subject .for example if we have intrests in the general chemesty subjects we must do our specilization in that and do researches and go and experiment on our universe .if we are intrested in any of the pharmaceutical field we can do our specilization and do phd program by discovering many drugs on a particular research .as the present society is filled with many diseases the drug discovery plays an important role .if we are intreasted in politics or journalism , we must do the specilization in the particular subject and must go into the politics or as an journalists , this is why because in the present societ we are lacking in educated politicians .finally , i conclude from my above paragaraphs that the specilization in a particular subject is necessary why because it influnces the society a lot .as i mentioned that what we have learnt is just a drop in the ocean proves my above examples .finally , this is my view about doing specilization in a particular subject .
