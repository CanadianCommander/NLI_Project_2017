some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .on one hand i agree with this idea but on yhe other hand i think it is not true .of course young people have usually no responsabilities and serious problems to be sad .they play games and they live without thinking to their future .young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragical events of the life .this time is the best period for dreams , and young people think that they have all their life to do what they want .when we become older , we loose this part of dream which caracterizes young people .death and illusions have destroyed our part of innocence .but i can barely believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .happyness depends on lots of factors .even if old people have already lived a big part of their life , i think this experience is the best way to appreciate the events .i mean that happyness depends on the value we give to an event .old people usually know what is the most important in the life .there is a kind of wisedom which helps old people to be happy and to enjoy life .moreover many young people have a lot of problems .they are not protected against the events of the life like illness .so i think that those two periods offer different way to enjoy life .we do nt enjoy the same things on the same age .each life s period is like a season which gives a lot of fruits .i think the real difficulty is to pick up the fruits . ..
