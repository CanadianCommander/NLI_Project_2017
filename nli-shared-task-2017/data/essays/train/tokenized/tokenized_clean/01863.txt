i agree that the , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , for several resones .first , this is the way of studing .if the students want to be seccessful in their study they must to understand the ideas and concepts first .for example , if the student has a giugraphy class and the teacher gave hime or her the information what he or she needs .but they are ideas , and they agnist the facts .then , the same studen has an exam in the same class .and he or she faced a qustion about the information , which is the teacher gave him or her .then , he or she wanted to write the answer to that qustion and the answer was an idea , which is agnist the fact .if the studen wrote the fact , he or she will miss the point , but he or fhe wrote the same onformationn , which is the profassor has given her or him , he or she will get the point .therefore , this is very important .second , it be helpfull for students on the futuer and incress the knowlge of them .how it is come ?learning the idea and the concepts is leading to facts .for example , if the students learn the ideas and the concepts , then they knew there are facts about the same things that will encorge them to find the facts .and if they kept in the same way , which is understand the idea and the concepts , then they will have really great knowlge and that will help them in the future .therefore , the that will incress the students  knowlge .in short , it is nice to learn facts too but i still agree that was why i agree that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is fot them to learn facts .so , ideas and concepts then facts .
