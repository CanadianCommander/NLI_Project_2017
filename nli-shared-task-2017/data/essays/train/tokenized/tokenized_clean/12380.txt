an idea or a concept is a point of a view about a fact and different people may have different thoughts and use different methods about the same topic .i believe it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts about a topic .to explain better , it can be said that the facts are like the targets and the different ideas and concepts about that fact is like the different ways going to the same target .for example one can say that the best way of melting the ice is by heating while the other can argue that putting the ice in the room temperature and wait till it melts is a better way .the two have different ideas about melting ice and of course have reasonable explanations for their own method , but this does not change the fact that the ice turns into water at the same temperature under same conditions .i think , the students should first learn about the facts but it is an important for them to learn also how other people reach to those facts .to give an example , fact is like a car and the ideas and concepts are like how to use a car .one without the other has no meaning , and both are necessasry to drive a car .consequently , to learn about the facts is crucial for the students but at the same time to learn about the other people s points of view , their thoughts and their methods is also an important part of their learning process .
