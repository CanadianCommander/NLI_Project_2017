i have been studying hard since i was a child and now i am about to graduate in electronical engineering .in my university path i chose the subjects i wanted to study and where i wanted to specialize in , so i surely think that it is better to acquire skills in one or few fields than to have a broad knowledge , mainly because you will never be able to have a culture so wide that covers all the subjects , and secondly since i am a pragmatic person and i would like to be expert in my field .human culture covers a huge variety of topics and subjects so i firmly think that no one is able to build such a vast culture .in fact i think that even the smartest person of the world such as einstein could not know everything .moreover studying many topics can create confusion or problems to remember all the things you have tried to learn .according to my pragmatic attitude i greatly prefer to acquire skills in a peculiar topic or field in order to become an expert .having a deep knowledge only in one field will help me to find a job that completely fits me and where i think i can contribute actively .in fact i think that everybody has to contribute to the benefits of society in which he/she lives and there is no better way to do that than focusing on one problem .in conclusion i absolutely disagree with the statement since i am trying to specialize in one particular field of elecronical engineering in order to become an expert .in fact i think that i will serve the society in which i live in a better way because focusing on one issue i will have many more possibilities to resolve it .
