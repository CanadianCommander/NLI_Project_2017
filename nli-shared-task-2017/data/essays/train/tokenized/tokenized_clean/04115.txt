the world is changing from day to day at a very fast pace .form the time when man used nothing but his foot to travel he has reached a stage where he covers the same distance that he could before in a much smaller time .technical advancement and man s thirst for more knowledge made these things possible .well , 20 years back from now in my country people used bullock carts , horses and man-pulled transport more than cars .so , chances are fair that 20 years from now man will use fewer cars for he might find a better alternative to it !!with this note i would like to agree with the fact that 20 years from now , there will be less cars on the road .in todays era there are already too many cars on the road flooding every nook and corner of the city and the outside of the city with equal intensity .the mode of transport that was believed to be the fastest till yeaterday had become the cause for the delay in most peoples travel schedule .why ? ..why not ?how many times have we come across situations when we start really early from home to meet someone or to keep up an appointment but , to our vain we find a road full of cars waiting for us to give them company .in any case even if the first hurdle is cleared we get to face another hurdle ` the red light signal  and before you realise you are already too late to keep up your appointment .this problem is faced by most of us .to overcome this , the upperclass people prefer to travel by a private jet of a helicopter rather than taking a road .while today it might be a transport of the higher class , 20 years is a long period to bring down the cost of air journey considerably , so much so that even middle class will be able to afford it .resulting in fewer cars on the road .the second reason for the contribution of less number of cars on the roads could be the scarcity of natural resources .while we all know how much petrol and desel is being burnt up every day in fuelling billions of cars all around the world , while the resources are very less .it could be firmly anticipated that after 20 years there might not be much fuel left to ignite all the cars .the country might take charge of the whole resource and use it only for the country s experimentation and space reasearch .the country would then encourage its people to use the publich transport such as buses and trams which would require considerably less amount of fuel expenditure .it might also emphasize on electric-rail travel .this would accounting for fewer cars on the road .the third reason might be the spreading awarness of pollution among the youth .the youth of today is the future power .it is seen that the children of today are very understanding and more inclined to understanding their environment and problems connecting to them .there is spreading awareness among the youth about living in a better place while leaving enough resources for the generations to come .this might lead to a revolution where people would prefer to travel in a more nature friendly mode than cars .this can already be seen among people of today .they try using their bike or walk to nearby distances and travel in groups to school so that only one car need to be fueled .this attitude might take a wider turn after 20 years resulting in fewer cars on the road .in all the ways stated above the ultimate result would be fewer cars .even if this is not the the ultimate result we should work for it to become the ultimate result .so that we can make our world a better place to live by avoiding global warming and pollution .
