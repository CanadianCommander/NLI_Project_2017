i strongly agree .i would like to say these days `` age of pr  .when i buy something , there is a very difference between i have seen advertisements or not .for exemple , when i buy and eat a mcdonald hamberg , i can trust before i eat .i would think what it has high quality and taist no matter what it have because i have seen mcdonald s advertisements long time and a lot of time , but when i buy and eat a hamberg which i have never seen advertisement before may be i can not trust it before i eat .sometimes people know what every advertisement are not really .sometimes advertisement has problmes which makes confuse people , but even like that advertisements make products much better .so i would like to say `` advertisement makes products seem much better than they really are .
