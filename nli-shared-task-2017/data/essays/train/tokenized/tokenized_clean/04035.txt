there are always two aspects for learning-one is to understand ideas and concepts and another is learn facts .both of these have their own importance .some times it is important to learn ideas and concepts than to learn concepts .in another condition learning facts have dominance over the understanding of ideas and concepts .both vary according to the situation .for a student studying the mathematics it will helpful for him to understand the concepts and ideas .learning basic concept will help him a lot .he can utilize these facts in solving many of his problems .another example for importance of learning the facts is here .a students can utilize a fact as a previous experience in solving a problem .suppose he is in a problem of choosing a product from same price .then he will utilize the fact of his previous life .for example one of his friend has puchased the same product one month before .while the use of this product his friend has problem .in this condition man will not buy this product as a fact that this product had harmful effect on his friend .some times it becomes important for students to pay more attention to ideas and concepts .if a student has no experience about decision which he is going to take then it will beneficial for him to use his ideas and concepts .in some subjects untill a student will not understand the ideas and concepts he will not reach to a conclusion .for example in a music class , if a student use his ideas and concepts he will be able to understand the quality of music in deep .he will perform better than the previous one .if he uses different concepts than it will help him a lot .so understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts has their own importance .they can also be used simultaneouly .in some condition idea and concepts are superior and in another condition they may have affect minor .so all depends on situation and the way in which a student use it .
