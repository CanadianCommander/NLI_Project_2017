how much people enjoys life depends on many factors .age maybe one of them .but is it a decisive factor that can entitled young people to enjoy life and older people not ?typically young people appears to be more energetic , situtation that is normally refered to as `` being full of life  .i agree with this affirmation but only in some extent .for example , most of young people do not have the amount of responsabilities that older people have like childrens or a job from which susbsistence of your family depends on .furthermore , older people tends to have mental burdens that come from decisions made in the past that are not satisfying their current expectations .these burdens can bitter a person and made him or her lose the sense of life enjoyment .on the other side , i agree with the statement that life enjoyment is not related to age .i have a good personal example to support this point .my mother was a person used to work during her entire life .she worked from 7am to 5pm and even she brought work at home .this sedentary life cause her health problems , like hypersensibility to weather changes ( she got a flu pretty easily ) and started to get fatter .this situation basically deprived her from enjoying life .she looked always sad and bitter and she started to seek a way to relieve watching tv , which in turn kept her away from friends and family avoiding her enjoyment of her personal relationships .three years ago , she started to go to a dance group in a local gym where she found herself comfortable and truly animated .right now , she dances every day .her health has improved considerably , his personal and social life has ameliorated to the point that now she is a different woman , one more confident that looks always happy .in the same way , another example is my friend carlos .he is very young .however , five years ago he missed the opportunity to study a doctor program in the us because he had personal problems with and ex girl friend .he was already studying the program , then he had to drop out university .since then , he does not forgive himself from this situation and constantly looks sad and depressed .based on the reasons and examples provided i have to disagree with the statement presented .i think that the mental and emotional framework in which people based their actions determines how much they enjoy life regarless their age .
