today adertisements are everywhere ; television , newspaper , magzine , even on the surface of the cars .those products on the ads always look so nice , but are they really like how they are decribed on the ads ?no .using stars is a very common stradegy for ad .for example , those famous models that appear on the skin production ads suggest people to use that product , saying it s really good and all .makes people it is that product that actually made her so beautiful , but sometimes they do nt even use it at all .some ads about food says it would make you feel you are in the some place alse , like in the park , on top of the moutain , in the wild nature , etc .it s just so unreal , and i never trust those kinda ads .they often uses no.1 in the nation , no.1 in the state , or no.1 among same business .but sometimes you can see there are more than one no.1 ; so which one you can trust .so overall , i think ads are just used to make products look better , so people will buy them .
