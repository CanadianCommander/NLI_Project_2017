in my opinion , a good education system should always start with the understanding of ideas and concepts rather than with the learning of the facts .this is true from the very beginning of your education to the end of your academic life .when you start your studies at the primary school you are just a child , often unable to link the facts the teacher is trying to teach you , in a more complex grid .the substructures of this grid are ideas and concepts .although it might appear easier to learn facts before understading the ideas lying behind them , this way of teaching always leads to a lack of background structures and , therefore , to a lack of understanding : children will learn facts by heart , yet they will be unable to collect them into a coherent structure , hence failing their tests .while a way of teaching focused on the understanding of ideas and concepts is the best choice for primary education , it can be really useful even in secondary and tertiary education .for example , if you study philosophy at the university , you will be thought nothing but ideas and concepts : is , therefore , studying philosophy only a waste of time ?i definitely do not think so .if you think about how many former students of philosophy you can find working in very different fields , you will eventually agree with me .why those former students , who never received an education based on facts , are so successful in the work life ?this is because they have a fully developed grid of ideas and concepts that always helps them understand quickly what kind of task they are asked for , even if it has nothing to do with socrates , plato or kant .to sum up , an education based on the understanding of ideas and concepts is a better choice in order to develop a grid of thought that enables you to vary between many different disciplines .
