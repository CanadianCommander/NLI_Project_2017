students have a number of ways to learn nowadays .personally , it is much better when i study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea .i believe that grasping ideas and concepts rather than fact is the best way to suceed .learning facts are very hard keep becasue you could forget them over time , understanding concepts is valuable when you are in different topics or environments , and finally students skills could be enhance .it could be very valuable to study dates or names of events for example .they could help you answer the questions of your test of history .but you could forget it after few days .while understanding the concepts could help for a long time .for example , understanding why the a battle started , what were the conditions after the battle finished , and son on .it could be in your brain longer than learning facts .undestanding concept could be valuable when you are studying a different topic .for example , the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict .on the other hand , if you just learned the dates or names of the people who fought in the even , maybe you have to study againg for your business or your geography class .students could develop better skills if the learn concepts and ideas .they could argue for example , why the battle happened , or even learn that war conflict are not the best way to thrive .they could even interested and pursue a carer in history .i think learning concepts and ideas from a topic , give you many opportunities fot your future life .for all these reason , i support the statement that students should learn ideas and concepts rather that facts .it imprive their skills , help them to other subjects and enhance their skills .
