the issue of the extension of knowledge , of wether it is better to know about a lot of topics , or to know very much about a specific topic , requires , to be sorted out , the asumption of what do people consider good to be ?indeed , some people will only be concerned by practical issues and will tend to regard a good thing as a usefull thing , whereas some other people will look at knowledge as a end and will be prone to learn about everything .my opinion is quite divided , and will be respectively explained according to these two points .i am actually interested in a lot a subjects , and although i chose scientific studies , i am quite intereted in art or litterary subjects , such as painting and history .in that way , i consider learning to be a real pleasure , and not a means .even if i know that they want be usefull to achieve the vital things , it does not matter to me .moreover , i really think that it contributes to open my mind to various people and cultures , and that it make my personnality develop .besides , i am also interested in cars mechanics , which allow me to avoid very difficult situations !as a consequence , being interested a lot of various topics can also be usefull , and growing one s knowledge is never wasted time .however , i truly think that , most jobs , at a time or another , really requires an expertise a its core field , to reach an important efficiency , which implies a specialization in a specific subject .for a majority of jobs , it is needed to focus on a main issue , all the more that if something is at stake , and there is no time for unnessary things .for example , i am supposed to be an ingeneer , and it is absolutely necessary that i specialize in a field , so that i can become able to solve given complicated problematics .every one needs to be honest and acknowledge that no one can know every thing .it is incoditionnal to specialize to reach a high level of skills , and to be good at work .to conclude i would say that it de
