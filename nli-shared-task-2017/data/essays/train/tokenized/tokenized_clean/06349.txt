according to the statement , that it is better for students to understand what they learn , namely the concepts and the ideas , rather than learning facts by heart , is convincing to me .in general it is more effective to a student to learn ideas and concepts , as they will last longer in their memory .i can emphasize this by my own experience , as it s very difficult to memorize facts .learning dates for instance for a history course does not help a lot in understanding why historical events happened or what effects they could have on our contemporary time .facts also does not help the students in the future , when they leave the university .when entering the job world , it is much more helpful for a student to know the basic concepts and ideas , which he or she can apply in his or her job .taking the example of the history course again , it would be more logic , if the student learn the main differences between the epoches or the essential research methods , which historians need to accurately do their work .the studies should provide a framework , within the students can work by their own .some lecturers would argue that it is nevertheless important to know some facts .i agree with that , but learning facts should not be the main part of the class work .there should be rather more interchanging action in the class , so that maybe old concepts will be discussed critically and new ideas can develop .understanding the ideas and concepts provides the student with the ability to use them and work independently .this should be the prior aim of every university , namely to educate the student to an independent thinker .
