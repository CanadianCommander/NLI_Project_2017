there are a lot of people , most of them young people , who say that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it truth ?well , to be honest i agree .i think young people enjoy life a lot more that older people do for the following reasons .in first place , young people are experimenting everything that older people already did .they have more energy and fisically they are able to do , what sometimes older people ca nt do .older people is most of the time tired or in bad mud and they do nt want to do anything .i m not saying that all of them are like that but most of them sometimes become angry people and they live their lives so .instead young people is ancious to live their lives and to have the experiences older people had .for example , i m a young person and i think i have such much more fun than my parents do !it is obviuos .that s because they have a lot of responsabilities and a lot of things to worry about .but for me is a lot different , because i do nt have kids , i do nt have to work and i do nt have to worry about anything , but the school and doing my homework .i can do a lot of things they ca nt , for example i can watch tv on the afternoon all the time i like but my parents have to go to work so they ca nt or i can go out on the weekends with my friends but some times it s impossible for my parents to go out with their friends .and i think that all these things make that some persons become like that .of course with all those things they ca nt enjoy life like young people do .so that , these maybe some of the reasons why people say that and in my opinion it s truth .
