to evaluate what will happen in twenty years is a difficult task .one question is to know if there will be more cars or not .first we will consider the arguments given to predict a reduction in the number of cars , then the evolutions that indicate a rise in this number .nowadays the price of petroleum is in a constant rise .as the oil reserves are getting smaller and smaller , a oil crisis is predicted in less than twenty years .so using a car will become more and more expensive .maybe people will try to use it less , which means a reduction in the number of cars .moreover as the center of cities are now overcrowded , the policie is to reduce the number of cars in cities .laws are enforced to limit this number , as for instance in london where you have to pay to use your car inside the city , or in paris where new public transports are being built .in twenty years we can assum there will be new and more efficient public transport wich will make car no longer a necessity for people .nevertheless i do nt believe in that evolution .even if there will be no enought oil to sustain the developpement of cars , other sources of energy now exist and will be developped .using biologically made oil , or electricity we will still be able to run cars .moreover , if we focus on the developpement of cities , we observe that car is a nessecity if you live in the suburb of a big city .as ore people will live in suburbs than now , we can guess public transports , even if they evolve , will not be sufficient .last point is the developpement of china and india .even if there a proportionnally less peple who will buy a car in developped countries , when this two countries will be developped there will be a new market of more than two billiard people !in conclusion even if argumets can be given to justifie there will be less cars than today , i think there will be ; ore cars .
