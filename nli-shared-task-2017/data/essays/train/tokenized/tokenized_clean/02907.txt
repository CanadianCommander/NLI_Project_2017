it has been commonly said that successful people do not do things differently but they just think differently .successful people generally have the tendency of taking risks in situations .sucessful people generally have the knowledge and expertise apart from that they try and deal situations in a different manner .let us take the examples of corporate leaders like bill gates or warren buffet , who have been so successful in the corporate world .both of these men have dealed with situations in an unconventional manner and the results are with everyone to see .bill gates explored new territories of computer software which made the microsoft so famous .for a person to be successful in the world certain qualities like leadership , business acumen , creativity and knowledge are very important .successful people along with these qualities have risk taking ability .they generally take risks and try new things which makes them apart from the rest of the human herd .new innovations in science is another example of what humans can achieve if they keep on trying with different things .the idea of gravitation which was given by newton was because he thought differently from the rest of the people as every one in his time saw the apple falling from the trees .to try out new things is very important and it is the quality which is inherent in most of the successful people .the successful people generally take failures in their stride .edison who invented the bulb had to face so many time failures yet he persisted with the idea of making the bulb and ultimately was able to accomplish his goal .successful people generally along with their hard work and perseverance try and accomplish waht noone has achieved till now .so i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing only what they know .
