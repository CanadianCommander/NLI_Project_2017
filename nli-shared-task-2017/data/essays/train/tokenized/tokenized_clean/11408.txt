i do not disagree with that most adverisements make products seem much better that they really are .it is obviously advertisements  job to do and also it is natural human beings .for instance , when someone took a photo and they need to send their photos to somewhere they might not want to send their photos which looks terrible .advertisement is really important that how to pear their products to the consumers .advertisement products can be seen as different as they really are because of the different angles and shots .they requires high techonolgy of photogragh skills with a lights and backgrounds .moreover , advertisement has a powerful possibility to let people know about their products and one of the way how the products can be costed .therefore , sometimes people could be angry with their product when it is diffrent from what they saw in the advertisement and what they expected though advertisement products could look much better than they really are .
