in my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but i think it s the marketing way .it s absolutely comprensible that a company wants seem an his product better than it really is ; a company , in fact , have to see multiple factors , like for example the actractivity of the market , the other concorrent companies and in this situation the impact with the customers is fundamental .we can think , to understand the concept , how much advertisement is watched on tv ; if a message is reiceved from a lot of people , a certain product can be buyed from a large part of the population .probably this way is not ethically correct ; a person can be fascinated from a particular type of product , after the wiew of the advertisement , and then he can discover that this product is not what he expected .but i repeat that this is the market law , so the companies ca nt make in other terms .i think the positive way of this process is that a good product can have a lot of visibility wih the advirtisement .my mind goes , for example , to linux , an alternative software ; most of it s experts say it s better then windows , but it does nt have the necessary visibility ( and many other factors : for example linux is not organized as a company like his concorrent ) to fight it .in many cases i have choosen a product for the fantastic advertisement of that product ; i like very much coca - cola , i ever buyed it , probably i d prefer pepsi , but i have never buyed it , because i m a fanatic customers of coke , in part for his beautiful advertisements , that remind me when was a chld .in other words , a lot of advertisemnets can decide the consumation of a produc
