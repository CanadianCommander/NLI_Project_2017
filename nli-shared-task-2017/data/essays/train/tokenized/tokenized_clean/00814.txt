i agree with the fact than advertisment make products seem much better than they really are .to begin with , advertisements do nt show real life .they show a world created around the product they advertise for , where it is vital .they show a world where everybody is in need of the product , and has no other alternative than using it - they are quite happy with that , by the way .in the real world , customers have choices , most of them perhaps do nt need the product , they have alternatives .furthermore , everything is clean in an ad .even in advertisements for hoovers , the dust seems to be just put down there , and goes with one use of the hoover .this makes the product looks better by comparison with the environment it is presented in : people think if they get the product , their lives will be cleaner and easier .then , in an advertisement , everything is presented to attract people .when a demonstration is needed , as for medications for example , the product acts fast and efficiently .the demonstration itself is made with colored drawings or animation .the product of course never crashes down , or is never used in a way where it would nt work as well as in the best conditions .this also make people think it will be easy to use the product , the effects occuring as fast and effective as a big colored arrow wiping the problem off .finally , advertisements are made to make a product look better .it is their purpose to make people buy it .and as there are in most of the cases many concurrents , and few really revolutionary products , you have to enhance what is good in a product .this is not recent .just going back to the middle-age , heralds were used to sing and tell the capacities and acts of their masters .they always made them look better than what they really were .most religions do as well promise better than what they can be sure to give .for as long as humans have existed , if one wanted to sell a product , one had to make it look better than what it really was .it is then normal to suppose modern companies selling modern products just do the same .to conclude , it is true advertisements make products look better than what they are .but there are no lies in them , just a little more than truth !
