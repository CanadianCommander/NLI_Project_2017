i agree with this statement .becouse i know many people who tried new things and took risks to success .one man came to study hair cutting to new york 30 years ago by him self .he is japanese who i met in new york .at that time when he came new york by ship , it was nt common at all .just few japanese were living in new york and nobody had nt tried to come studying hair cut .when he came new york , he was so poor and couldt speak english at all .he did nt know how he could learn hair cutting .so he just went into hair salon and asked to teach .and also he tried to make friends little by little .after few years later he got chance to have a shop .now he has many salon all of the world .my father is also one person who took risks .he is living in small city in japan .he is an archtecter and he has a office by himself .so he has to do all works by himself .i think it is a risk .he can do everything how he wants , but when he is sick nobody do nt his job .but he success very well becouse of it .pe
