recently , i recieved an anonymous , yet very impressive , e-mail power point presentation that made me reflect and musitate on various philosophies of life .on of these specifically captured my attention : `` to achieve something you have nt met with before , you must do something , well , that you have nt done before .certainly , successful people do capture fame because they have ventured out into a sea of opportunities rather than stay safely in a boat .literature has supported the idea that success arrives after an original challenge has been overcome .in the epic of gilgamesh , the hero directs himself to try to gain immortality by traveling to the end of the world .though he misplaces the final flower of youth , gilgamesh acknowledges a sudden sense of completion in his being and a spark of energy to change his kingdom .gilgamesh s goal of gaining immortality does complete itself , as is stated at the end of the epic poem , when his name is recorded in history and remembered throughout subsequent generations .however , the greatest examples of succes involving risk come to us in history .several names pop into my head : ghandi , mother teresa , martin luther king , jr. , betty williams , nelson mandella . ..all of these people participated and led heroic acts against the standards and conventions of society , against the expectancy of the crowd , and gave us , the present day generations , life , liberty , and justice .if this fails to ring up the word `` success  in my ear , i do not know what will .finally , personal experiences have rendered this belief of the correlation between risk and succes true .two years ago , i decided to try out for my school s soccer team .i played midfield , but i settled for goalie just because the team needed one .this position actually scared me , but , nevertheless , i kept practicing to develop my latent abilties .incredibly , i became an all-star goalie .even today , i have been invited to compete in the junior olympics as a keeper .all in all , success usually involves some type of risk .progress , innovations , and fame all resulted from wild attempts to change .in this case , `` change  is the key word .a transformation from safe to highly challenging equals a tranformation from loser to victorious .
