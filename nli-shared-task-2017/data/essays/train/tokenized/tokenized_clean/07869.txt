i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .maybe some young people had done enough , but in average level , it s true that most of young people use their time in play and enjoy their living time .i think there are some bad condition for the young people in-correct attitude and concept .they think it s not concern with them .maybe they have much more important things need to do and share their times , so they consider they are very bussy , so they ar nt willing to pay more time to helping their communities .i thinkthe best solution that need family , school and society share the duty to change young people s concept and attitude .so parents , teachers and government officers need work hard and corporate from now on .include study and education , let young people why they need pay more attention and time to helping their communities and let they know they have duty to keep this work continuly , when one day they marry and there are chilkdren , they need transfer this concept to their children all of their life .so make sure this world will keeping opportunity and enough power to helping t and keep their communities .of course , the government officers can use tv , newspaper and so on to open enough messages about who to helping communities .so most of young people are willing to handle and share enough duty to do it .at one word , all of people include younger and elder people , there are the same duty to keep and helping their their communities , so all of human there are more high quality community lever and society can grow up and implement every century and all over the world continuly and forever .bless the human can get best communities for everyone
