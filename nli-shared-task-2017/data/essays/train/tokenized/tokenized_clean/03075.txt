many people might find ` specialization  a convincing and advanced position especially in the modern business world .it appears to me , however , that those who have broader knowledge of many academic subjects , who might be called ` generalist  , will be getting more and more important .i work in one of the biggest banking groups in japan , which includes more than 30,000 permanent employees and over 10,000 part-time employees .generally speaking , the products and services that a bank provides require high-level and specialized knowledge , particulary in the stage where those products and services are developed and organised .however , those are not provided not only for professionals within the same industry but also for ordinary people who do not have any special know-how or skills of financial instruments .in this marketing stage , the importance of those who have broad knowleadge of many academic subjects can be clearly identified , because such people have a variety of perspectives based on the academic backgrounds and can approach the possible customers from various angles .this is one of the most important elements in promoting and enhancing business .secondly , according to my business experience , i would like to stress that good managers in an organization often have various academic backgrounds as well as a variety of business experience .i am not saying that a specialist who concentrates on one specific subject can not be a good manager .however , in most cases , it is the fact that senior managers need to cover extremely wide range of business area .in this context , a company is highly likely to regard those who have broad knowledge based on many academic subjects as potential candidates for good manegers or , finally , future board members .in the reasons stated above , i believe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more highly appreciated than are those who specialize in one specific subject , especially in the future business world .
