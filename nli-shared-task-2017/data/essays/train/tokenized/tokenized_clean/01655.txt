first of all , i would like to say that i agree with the statement .in my opinion success in life has to be with risks .one can be doing well in their lives ; for instance , one person can be a good profesional in his field , but very often happens that people tends to go following the easy way .for example , our hipothetical person can be a good teacher in a high school nad for that reason he will stay forever in the same school , or teaching the same level of students .he , might be to have quite an interesting life , but while doing the same he is not going to `` grow up  .i think that for that person would be more interestin to continue studying , try to get a masters degree in his field , and after that work in a college as a teacher at that level .of course , he is going to need to work hard ; teaching in his school , and after that going to the college , and his life during that time is going to be busy and stressful .also the risks he takes while trying to fullfil his dream is going to derivate in panic sometimes , but at the end , he will feel that life makes sense .sometimes people need to take the risk of changing the place of residence to try to have a better life or job , and they could feel panic .i am always in the opinion of moving on to have new opportunities , which can have the consequence of success .in conclusion , i admire those people that are not affraid of changes when the idea is to be a more interesting person and live a more interesting life .
