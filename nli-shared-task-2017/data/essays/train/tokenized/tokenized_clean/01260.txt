nowadays , it appears that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .i agree with this statement .as a teenager , i have witnessed these facts .for instance , young people are more preoccupied by leisure time than anything else .when they come back from school , their main wish is to let off steam , to rest or eventually have fun .parents do not necessarily force them to help their community , so it just does not come to their attention that their help might be needed .instead , they had rather watch television , go shopping or gather in groups of friends to just hang around .young people do not realize that even the smallest action can be of great help .for example , helping nurses to make inventories , caring for old persons staying in hospital or even babysitting can be of genuine help .i believe that they are not conscious of their inner selfishness .the problem is , their parents probably never pointed it to them .so who is the one to blaim ?true , most teenagers would consciously refuse to give up their plans to go help people in a hospital , but on the other hand if their parents forced them to do so once or twice , they might become aware of the need for their help .sometimes forcing somebody to do something he does not like can have positive outcomes .personally speaking , this is how i realized i was becoming a selfish person .one day my parents told me to do something useful instead of sitting on a sofa and watch television .since i am a rather good student , i figured i would spend most of my leisure time helping others who had difficulties .i have been doing this for about two monthes now , and i truly do not regret it .in addition to putting an end to my selfishness , it also taught me how to be patient and caring with people .most of my `` students  have now become friends .so , to sum up , being forced to do something for your own good is useful , and i strongly advise people to do so .
