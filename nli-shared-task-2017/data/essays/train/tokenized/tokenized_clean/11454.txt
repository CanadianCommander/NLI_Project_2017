throughout the centuries there have been many talks on what kind of education would be best for students .is it more important to help students understand ideas and concepts of what they re learning , or is it more important to help students learn the facts ?different countries have come up with different solutions to these questions , and as a person who studied under both types of education system , i will say that i personally believe it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .from my personal experience of studying under the korean education system for a year and from hearing my peers  first-hand experiences , i say that korean education is more concerned on teaching facts rather than ideas and concepts to students .students memorize facts and statistics , line after line , without even understanding the meaning of what they are learning .this has a harmful effect in a long run because after examination is over , students will no longer remember what they learned .on the contrast , if students come to understand ideas and concepts of what they are learning , the knowledge has become their own and will stay in them for long term .for instance , when i was little , i hated science because i had to memorize numerous formulas and facts that i did not understand .however , under new american science teacher i began to thrive in science as he taught me the basic ideas and concepts of science .as i understood what i learned and digested it as my own , i came to appreciate science more .in conclusion , although both types of educaton is necessary and students need to understand and learn both ideas/concepts and facts , i think it is more important for students to understand facts and concepts first because it will be much easier to learn the facts after understanding the concept .
