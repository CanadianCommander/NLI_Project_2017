the human always need to be educated to reach good life standards therefore learning is a very important aspect of humanslife .everyone has different point of views about the idea of education .some assume that it is more important for students to understnad the ideas and concepts , in contrary to those some think learning facts are more important .i personally agree with the second idea .these are my following reasons ;firstly , learning by facts is permanent .experiments are good examples for facts .for example , the one makes an experiment on the frogs in the lab in order to see the system inside of its body , he wo nt forget what he has seen for the years later .because it is realistic and live .in addition to this , learning facts makes people feel confident .for instance , the one is studying medicine if he studies just on the ideas of the professors and the concepts in latin it will not work , he needs extra experience in order to be a good doctor .as he has experienced the facts , he will gain self confidence because he will have the control on the patience .the last but not least , learning facts are easier than ideas and concepts .for example , the teacher will tell the students about a historical event , visiting a museum will be more attractive than reading from a book .because when they visit the museum they will see the photos taken and the paintings drawn in that years .photos and paintings are the most helpful equipments for the facts .the students will not only enjoy the time in museum but also will learn easily .all in all , as i said before learning facts is both permanent and makes people feel confident as well as it is easy .the long and the short of it is that , action speaks louder than words .
