the issue of education is controversial due to lot of thinks and particulary we can ask ourselves if is it more important to teach ideas and concepts or only facts ?some people think that it is more important to have a global view and to understand generals concepts and ideas in order to develop a better culture and knowledge .but to believe that learn facts it s more important and easier to understand can be also partly justified .taking into account all the aspect , i strongly feel that it s more important to learn and remember fact .there are several reasons that illustrate my point of view .first of all i think that it s very important to learn and understand facts to can not forget the pasts events and to no remake the same mistakes .for instance , i think that the most important thing is not to learn to student the general concept of the war but to explain them the real facts and events in order to sensibilize them strongly and to show them the mistakes to not reproduce .secondly , an other argument is the fact that it s easier to understand and remember facts then ideas or concept .effectly i think that you can have more intention by given example to student .in an economic classroom for example the marx s concept is very important but we can not understand and remember it if the profesor do not remind it in the context and give some examples of it application .last but not the least , i believe that a classroom is truly more interested if the teacher illustrate his purposes with fact .in a history course , the teacher who wants to explain the organization concept during the roman period , he would be more understanding and his course would be more illustrated if he gives real facts .in a nutshell , my belief is that both statememt : learn facts or ideas and concepts are important and necessary .but the most important aspect to remember a idea is to illustrate it .
