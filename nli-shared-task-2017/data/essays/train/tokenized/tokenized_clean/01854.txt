i agree with the statement mentioned in the question .there are several arguments for my decision which i try to illustrate in the following essay .first of all , trying new things and taking risks always contain new chances which would nt be offered to you otherwise .if you continue what you already know , there wo nt never be the chance to develope .i want to give an example to demonstrate my thoughts : i ve been living in small town in the south of germany for 20 years .i knew nothing about the life in a big city or how people in other parts of germany behave .but last year i had to move to hamburg because of my new job .knowing nobody it was a hard beginning in such an enourmous metropole .now i can state that my personnel horizont has grown a lot because i made experiences i would have never lived staying at home with my parents .furthermore , life would be very annoying without no action or risks .the most people have to work all the day and for that reason there is nt much time remaining for hobbies .why should nt we try something extraordinary or ecxiting in our less free time ?for example , learning a new instrument or trying bungee jumping ?as for me , these are the highlights which enriches our lifes because they offer us a short break in our every day life .the third argument that i want to mention concerns taking risks .i m totally convinced that we ca nt reach a high aim by excluding every risk .for example if someone gives up his or her safe job in an economy in order to start his or her own business , there will always be the risk that the business can fail and that he or her will lost all the money .for that reason , it s necessary to accept the risk and to be conscious of because you will only be able to success if you are nt fear the disadvantages or the risks .
