when you ask me , if i agree or disagree this statement my answer would be : both .on the one hand are many young people active community-members .they help for an example in sportclubs , take care of older people or are in a political party .all these activities support the community .on the other hand many young people don `` t care about the community .they are a kind of egoistic and the reasons vary .often you hear from young people that they don `` t have enough time to help their community , because they have a lot of work to do .but i think this is not the entire truth .some people are afraid of taking responsibilty for something or can `` t act in teams .moreover they are thinking only of time or money and forget that it can be a great feeling to help others .mostly these people are great critics but they don `` t try to improve things by helping .my guess is they are lazy too .advantages of helping in your community are that you meet interesting people and learn some skills , like speaking in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you .although it cost you some leisure it can be fun .in summary i think it `` s good for your community as well as for your character to say yes to a task and help in a community .
