whenever i plan for traveling , i consider whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel individually without a tour guide .however , even though there are some people who prefer to travel individually , i like to journey following an instructor .as i have experienced in both ways , i believe there are more advantages to travel in a group led by a tour guide .first , traveling with a tour guide makes people be more comfortable .for example , when i travel following a tour guide , i feel comfortable about not thinking of the direction of the new place .the instructor had already planned where our group was supposed to visit , eat , and book the hotel , so there was nothing i worried about .second , it is safe to travel with a tour guide .because the tour guide knows where we go , there is less chance to be lost in the foreign country .also it is more comfortable to travel with a person who can communicate in the language of the country which i do not know .last , it is easier to get information of the place where we travel .since guiding is his or her work , the instructor knows information about where he or she take people .thus , people who travel within a tour guide easily get close to the new information as they listen to the instructor .when i visited europe , i was fullfilled with the questions of the history of where i travel such as `` winter castle  in russia and alps mountain in switzerland .because i did not know how to speak english at that time , there was no way to ask to residents .however , with the tour guide s help and information , i could satisfy with what i wanted know easily .with these reasons , i disagree with the statement , `` the bes wat to travel is is a group led by a tour guide .it is more comfortable and safeto travel where i do not know much about it .
