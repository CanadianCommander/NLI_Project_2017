i agree that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .i sometimes buy the fashine magazine .when i read it , i have seen many advertisments .first of all , it is about the diet food .some people which tried it and sucsseeded the diet was intervewed .many of them said that `` to be on diet is easy because it helped very much  .other people said `` it is very delicious .i recommend it , so please try it once  .the advertisments have also the picture before the person who try to use the diet food and after the person who tried to do it .i think i ca nt belive it .to be on diet is very difficult .i also think it is not good taste .few years ago , i attracted this advertisments , so i tried the diet food .it is written `` if you eat this , you can lose 3kg for one months  .i trusted it , and i countine to do it , but i could nt lose my weight .the diet food says it is delicious , but it is not delisious .it taste the robber .second , it is the cell phone .when i buy the cell phone , i see the advertisments .it is reason why i can compare the many cell phones at once easilly .a lot of advertisments shows how easy to use the cell phone .it also says a lot of functions .in conclusion , i think a lot of advertisments make their products looks better than ther really are .
