people , especially common people , often discuss whether it is necessary to try new things and take risks rather than only doning what they already know how to do well .but i strongly believe that succssful people try to new things and undergo risks .if it were not for taking harships and trying new things , they have no opportunit to win other competitiors .successful people generally more bold and painstaking than those who do not .as everyone know , this is not the only way of succeeding in doing , but this is one of the most effecitive way of succeding .in addition , it can positively contribute to find new ones that gives people a lot of confidence .let s say that a scientist try to reasearch new things , if he is just the man who just mix other theories that already every people knows .he would never be successful in his filed .if he tried to find new things and take harship , he would succeed .successful people also think different way in every time .i understand that too much attention paid to new things is negative becasuse it may cause much more cost to do and sweep memebers along , sometimes to the detriment of their original work .but the advantages of tinking creatively eclipse the disadvantages .for example , people who always think different for winning in the market econnomy can find the fraction between many products .so he can beat other competitiors .as everyone knows people can not work to its best ability when there is not new one that enable company to be vigorous as well as company to win in economy .taking all of things into account , there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to successful people or to win in some fields , you should be not doing what you know how to do well but doing more courageable , painstaking and creative .
