facts are those that often people believe .if the facts are not derived from the ideas and concepts of the relevant subject then they doesnt have strong roots to be considered as facts .people are almost all fooled if they believed in the facts in which they does nt have enough understanding ideas and concepts .so i prefer in ideas and concepts in which most of the facts are emerged .in favour to my decision i can suggest the examples of physics area in which newton has made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force .this fact has not just emerged from the idea that an apple thrown up has fell down .he went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth .as a result we learn today the laws of newton .so as far as the example is concerned i strongly believe in ideas that led to facts and the student community should focus on thatthe example i give is the invention of electricity that benjamin franklin has given .the mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity .she made efforts to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particles which are responsiponsible for that shock .this led many theories in physics and later scientists created wonders with this concept .the argument can proved in all other areas not only in science .students does understand the facts unless they are projected with concepts and ideas .so unless the facts are supported with enough ideas and concepts the facts are never facts and there will be a black spot always if it is believed blindly
