in my opinion success has nothing to do with trying new things or taking risks .what is success ?it s when a person is doing his best relatively to her or his potential .maybe it is not something new it is something what he or she always has done .another thing is the learning-effect and beeing successful in that case .there i agree that you are more successful in the event of learning when you try doing new things .for example a young guy between his twenty s , doing always the same thing , let s say , working as a printer .it would nt be successful when he would continue his whole life in doing this work in beeing in the same position and the same company forever .a successful person would try to go further .change companies , learn from the best in the field , go to school , trying to take a job in the adminstration .maybe he will fail once or twice .but on the end , he will be successful , because he can look back and say : i have tried new things and i have done my best .another way of beeing successful is by taking risks .it s usually a small way between beeing risky and beeing stupid .most people know they are stupid after beeing risky .as an example let s take a gambler which put his whole safings on one number in the roulette .the number turns , the ball jumpes and takes place in another number than the gambler wished to .that s stupid we would say .but if it had been his favourite number , than he would be immediately successful .therefore , in my opinion , to be risky does nt mean you are successful .we probably can say that the more risk we take , the bigger is the success , but also the bigger we can fail .important is not be in a steady positon , where no success ever will occur .
