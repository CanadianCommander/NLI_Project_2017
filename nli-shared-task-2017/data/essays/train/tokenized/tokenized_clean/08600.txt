although it is hard to admit , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i support it because even though i have many friends , i know nobody who is or has been involved in activities in their communities .there are , in my opinion , two main reasons for this .one of the reasons is because young people , especially students , are busy with their school work or afterschool activities .when i was in highschool , i got up at 7am , studied until 3pm , then practiced tennis ( because i was in tennis team ) until 6pm and got home at 7pm .this i did for 6 days per week , and had only sunday to rest .all i wanted to do that day was stay home and relax , not be involved in activities for the community .the same can also be said about university students , most of whom study , be involved in activities , and work at the same time .there is , i think , just not enough time for young people to cast their attention to their communities .that is one of the reasons for their not helping their communities .the other reason is because young people are just not interested in their communities .their interest is in their friends , games , parties , hobbies : in other words , themselves .they lack the voluntary spirit or the will to cooperate and help the region they live in .when i was in university , i had a lot of friends .they had high goals for their future , and studied a lot ; being serious , they were interested in economics and politics , reading lot of books too .but even they were not involved in any activities for helping their community .young people , being much more energetic and active than elders , should be participating in helping their communities .but for the reasons stated above , they are not .therefore , i support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
