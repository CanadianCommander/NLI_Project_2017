nowadays , the use of cars is quite controversial .indeed , some people are defenitely still in favour of keeping them , whereas some others claim its use should be reduced , if not banned .the consequences this debate may have on the future use of cars , and the reasons of this debate deserve to be discussed .at frist glance , this issue may appear superficial , but it is an essential one , since it is related to one fundamental problem the whole world is facing , that is to say environment .indeed , the car is a major source of pollution .however , western countriesinhabitants are used to it , and would see its disappearance as a step toward the past .for a long time , car has symbolised modernity , but moreover freedom .with a car , one can go wherever he wants , whenever he decides it .in the united states maybe more than in any other countries , car has been praised as a fundamemtal element of one s life .billy wilder s moovie , ` sunset boulevard  states that he just ca nt live without his car , since it would be like having his legs cut .considering these facts , it is hard to assert that in twenty years , cars will no longer be used .though , there is no denying that its use will probably slow down .more and more people feel concerned about pollution , and as i said it previously , the car is a major source of pollution .these people aim at gaining some influence in the political fields , in order to get the opportunity to be heard .in europe , their influence over the debate is increasing , and countries such as sweden as more and more often taken as examples , since it is a pionneer in this field .in the wake of this change concerning the environment issue , many countries have already implememted different kinds of policies in order to lower its use .despite it is often rejected by the populations , we may hope behaviours will evoluate .in addition to that the lack of oil which is more and more discussed may lead to changes towards the lowering of cars  use .so , as a conclusion , i would say that there will certainly be fewer cars in use in twenty years , but we will have to wait for a little longer i think , to see the obvious changes .
