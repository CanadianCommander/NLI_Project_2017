in my personal opinion , i agree with the statement , that define successful people as the person who try new things and take risk rathern than only doing what they already know .i consider that succesful people share this definition , in the sense , that people that doesnt try new things , experiments , or adventures will suspend or shorten out their knowledge , convertenting them into not succesful people and standard people .if you have that spirit of investigating , like in trying new ways of finding certain knowledge , you could consider yourself as a succesful people .other important thing , is that if you are scare of trying new experiments or new methods , that at first could seem rare or odd , you coud never have the believe that you are going to succes in the life .if you study the history , you could find some example of scientist like gramman bell , franklin and mark twain , that assume many risk on their investigation and tried hundreds of time their experiment , here they never settle up .now their discoveries and their knowledge are recognize in the world wide , and they were successful and recognize scientist .this scientist never decline in their idea of investigating new things , this characteristic permit them to go beyond the other people that dont try or investigate new things .always , when you tried new thing , you have a porcentage of failing in what you are doing or of getting your objetive , but imaging if you take the risk and invent something that nobody have reach to .i can support my afirmation , with some particular examples in my life .in order to have all what i had , my father had to affront new things , sometimes he fail on what he started , and other times he achieve the goal .because of this argument , i consider him as a succesful man in life .in conclusion i consider that by trying new things , you could convert into a better huamn and also a successful person .
