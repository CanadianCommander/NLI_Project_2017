i agree that travelling with a group which is led by a tour guide is the best way for many reasons such as : the tour guide knows many places than we do , gives us more information about what we are visiting , safes our money as well .first , i prefer to travel with a group and which is guided by a tour guy because this going to give me a chance to know as much places i can know .also , the tour guide knows what are the best places we are visiting more than we do .however , travelling individually make the trip more flexiable .the second reason why i prefer to travel in a group is that the tour guide tries to provide us with more information about places we are going to visit with .in addition , the tour guide knows that our time is valuable and we do not have that much time to waste in our things .this is what makes travelling with a group enjoyable .third , travelling with in a group safes our money and the cost of this trip does down .for example , i have travelled many time by my self for a ten days to egypt and i have spent more money than my family did when they visited egypt with a group guide .for this reason , i have become to an idea which is travelling with a group is cheaper than by myself .finally , i encourge people to travel with a group for these reasons .and , travelling in a group going to make the trip less costly for them .
