people are frequently faced some difficult situations .when they meet these circumstances , they act differently .some are trying to find other new ways and others are not .i prefer the the first rather than other .i believe this is the way to find better life in my life .first , most of successful people willingly took risks .for instance , bill gates who is the millonaire in the world accepted the new situation .he was a normal student in the university like other students but suddenly changed his way to find new one which other people did nt care about it .what if he did nt do at that time , we could nt use the computer personally so quickly .second , the conditions we live in now was nt able to developed without taking risker .imagine , everybody avoid taking risks and stay where they are .they never think which is needed to live better life .they are not usually achivement and outgoing people .success never come to people who do nt seek to find it .third , taking riskers are always moving .as soon as they are accustomed to deal things , they started to find others .it s not easy to begin with a new one .because it requires much attention from them .but it is worthy to spend time on the new one even if it gives nothing .after failing , they realized something from them .and it helps to other steps .i like the proverb that failing is the mother of success .without this mind , successful people can not strive in the world .i would like to be a one of the take riskers .taking risks needs to have challege mind but it will bring me a successful life .
