the issue at hand is whether students should concentrate on understanding or to `` cram  facts .this issue is difficult because it depends on the subject .in some subjects like physics it is more important to practice understanding and approaching theories rather than learning facts by heart .in other subjects , like medicine , both facts and understanding are essential .but to know about facts dominates .i believe that to focus on studiying facts is the better option , because if appropriate learned they will last forever .to study facts intensivley and frequently is preferable because it s the fundament of your knowledge and therefore the basis of your proficiency .facts you once gained will be availible at any time when required .for example a doctor always has to rely on his | her basic knowledge about physiology .if he | she would have to look up a process before curing , treatment would take too long .in addition , would such a behaviour be reliable ?because facts are the basis of our jobs i think most studies should focus on building reliable knowlegde .additionally , to stay with the example , a doctor continously has to learn and to advance his knowlegde .without appropriate knowlegde he wo nt be able to understand new research .and therefore wo nt be able to cure his | her patients in a actual manners .to learn how to approach new findings wo nt help .ultimately , i feel to focus on studying facts is the right choice .i believe this , because
