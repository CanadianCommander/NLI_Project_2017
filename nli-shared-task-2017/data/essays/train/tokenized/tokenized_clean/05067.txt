knowledge is a very important part of our daily routine .gaining knowledge may be a very imprtant part of a students career .students gaining knowlede are offered jobs in view of their knowledge towards a particular subject .it may be a point that it is essential to have a minimum grip over the remaining subjects rather than just having broad knowledge about a single acadamic subject .so by the following we can say that it is better to have a broad knowledge about many acadamic subjects rather that just a single or specific subject .there may arise different situations by which the broad knowledge ove a specific acadamic subject would be sufficient .just consider a software engineer who has a broad knowledge about the software part of his system is not capable of solving the hjardware issues arising .in the same way a person who is good at computers can not work for a company where mechanical engineers are required .hence if a person is capable of having broader knowledge about the various acadamic subjects there may be chance that he mey even jump from one sector to the other just like a person findin softaware jobs more interesting thjan the mechanical jobs .he can change his platform only if he has a broader knowledge about the software concepts .having broad knowledge over various acadamic subjects would help us out in various situations .let us even consider a person attending an interview in a huge establishment .ther is no gaurantee that the inteview may contain questions relating to his subject , rather the interview may even consisit of questions over various issues relating to various other subjects .a person who is capable of containing broader knbowledge over just one issue may not be able to get through the interview to get the job .we can even consider the part of quiz competetion that include the subject of various other subjects rather than just a single subject .a person with broader knowledge over various subjects may only be capable of clearing the quiz competetion .hence we can say that `` it is better to have broad knowledge over many acadamic subjects rather than just specialize in one specific subject  .
