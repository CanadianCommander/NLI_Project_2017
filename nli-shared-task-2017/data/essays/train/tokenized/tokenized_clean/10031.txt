it has always been in debate whether having a broad knowledge of many academics subject is better than being specialize in one specific subject .there have been many good reasons for both sides and in conclusion it is a only a matter of opinion .in my opinion , i believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many things than be specialized in one subjectfirstly , if one has a broad knowledge of many things because one is more aware of his surroundings .know a little about a lot makes you more cultured since you can discuss and converse on different topics even if you are not specialized in one .you also are not puzzled by simple questions that many specialized people would nt be able to answer outside their subject of knowledge .if you are with a person that only knows about one subject , his field of conversation is much smaller than one that has some knowledge about many topics .secondly , being specialized in one subject never means that you know everything there is to know about the topic because there will always be questions .socrates said , `` i know that i know nothing  .einstein also said that the more one knows , the more he understands the little knowledge he has .these two great people in history are commenting on what is problemetic of specialized knowledge .once you dig deeper in a subject more problems will always apear .once you know one more fact in the sobject , two more questions will arise .finally , to have success in the future , at work or in life , one will eventually use more that the knowledge of one subject .one will impliment the vast knowledge he has to solve the obstacles ahead of him .maybe you are a great mathematician but know nothing of psychology , you will have a hard time going through life with just being an expert in that subject .math will not help you when you are trying to raise a family or looking after children .there must be a balance of esencial knowledge that people must havein my opinion , to be succesful in life and be able to handle the obstacles in it one must have an all-around knowledge of many esencial instruments that will be used later on .you will sacrifice deep knowledge about subjects but gain much more in life .life does nt come in subjects , in comes in a whole .being prepared for the whole is the key .
