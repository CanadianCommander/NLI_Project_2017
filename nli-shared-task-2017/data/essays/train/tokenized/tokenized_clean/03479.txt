i stand behind of the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .there are three reasons : changed society , health and internet .first , comparing to some decades before to present , the society has completely changed .old timers were spending time for themselves to live somehow for gaining money as much as possible when they are young .however , young people these days are given with almost any goods which are essential for everyday s living when they are born .therefore , young people can spend their time for enjoying themselves .secondly , although in order to enjoy life , people should be healthy , older people more likely not to be healthy than young people .if they are sick , even they are very much optimistic person , it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough .lastly , in present circumustance , in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society , people are needed to operate a computer and usage an internet service enough .to operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people .for instance , my father who is 65 years old only can type by his right hand so that using a lot of time to operate a computer .also in the occasion of the computer crushed , my father , one of the older person , ca nt solve the situation .on the other hand , young people are more used to usage a computer and know much about it and internet servece .in their age , computer in no more complicated material than mere everyday s staff like a microwave .younger people usually are much more familier to the system of computer and know about several solutions about the computer trouble comparing to olders .also young people can type the keybord faster than oldtimers , in that way young people do nt feel flustration for using a computer .for all those reasons , i think young people are enjoying their life than old people do .
