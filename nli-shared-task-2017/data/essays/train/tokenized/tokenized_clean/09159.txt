in my opinion , it is more imnportant for a person to have as much extensive knowledge of a variety of academic subjects as he or she can because of two good reasons .firstly , it could be considered to him and others as his bachkground knowledge and experience of life .secondly , some knowledge of everything is preferable that one might someday be in need of the use of that type of knowledge , and employ it in his or her own life .on the other hand , being epecialized in only one subject and forget about knowing a little from and a little from therer might make someone ignorant when he or she is exposed to situationms where he or she is required to make a response to a general knowledge stimulus .one s life is not limited only to books and what he or she is specialized in .in my society , when people gather at a party or any similar occasion , they do not just sit there .they talk about any topic that might interest their lives or thinking .for example , during my brother s wedding last week , people has discussed the impact of terreorist people on tourism in the middle east .i was personally astonished to know from common people that the number of visiting france is double the number that visits the middle east every year .what puzzled me more , is the source of the information .another important issue here is that we should not limit our knowledge to books because what is ion book is mostly hypothetical , and what we need in our life is some kind of knowledge that can be practical and benefitial .so , do we sometimes need to use that general knowledge we have ?the answer to thgis question might lie when any of us face a problem and think of a solution .provided our knowledge is limited , we may not be able to find a solution to that problem ; if the problem requires some knowledge of physical laws , or some chemical background .we do not need to be specialized in one field and when we have a small problm ask for help .thus , our general knowledge of different subjects definitely helps us to avoid every day trouble or have suggested soultions to problems that need a specialist .
