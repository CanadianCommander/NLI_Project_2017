what is the best way to learn ?to stay on the main idea and learn the facts or understand the idea , consepts and be able to demonstarate your ideas ?learning the facts is not the answer all the time .it is known from all the researchs and technics that has been used to teach to students that , giving the facts and trying to use this limited facts from that given information is never enough .is that what a students needs ?a student should know why it happened like that , how did it happen ?what was the cause to that ?what would happen in a different case ?they need to question these .this is how the doors to their minds should be opened .school is not the place just to teach students , it is a place to let the students learn , to learn how to learn , to demonstarte the ideas they have and to discuss about other ideas .this is the way how people communicate , find new ideas , invent new products .this is how we became .i ve heard about a lot of student failing on their major work areas just because that they have only the facts they have been thaught .whenever there was any outstanding problem , that limited knowledge was not enough for them .facts were not enough for them to find the solution .it is not questioning the education system , it s about us .we need to know how to let the new generations go .improve theirselves .do better , not for us but for theirselves .
