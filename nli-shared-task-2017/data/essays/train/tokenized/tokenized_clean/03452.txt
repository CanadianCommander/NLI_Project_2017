i strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group with a person that can guide you in the place where you are going .i believe that this is important in order to know a place because i usually like to visit places with a good historical background .if i want to take advantage of the time while i am travelling , and this time is limited , i do not want to waste it , just trying to recognize what places are important in that city or location .for instance , if i go to italy , i would love to go to all the museums , and famous restaurants .i also would enjoy the opportunity to go to the beaches in the mediterranean sea .normally , a tourist would need more than a month just to plan these activities .however , if you go with a tour guide , this person will make your life a lot of easier , because he or she already knows where to go , at what time , what are the important parts where a tourist should focus his attention .last year , my family went to dominican republic .we bought a all inclusive plan , but we did not have a guide .we were totally lost there , we did not know where to go .all the time people were taking advantage of us charging an incredible high amount of money for different services like taxi transportation , only because we do not have anybody that could give us advice or information about the usual fare for that kind of service .we had to pay $ 20 for buying a sunprotector .the most expensive sunprotector in my whole life .also , sharing your vacations with a group of friends is really wonderful .i would say that it could nt get better if you are travelling with the people you like and with somebody that already have a plan for you .
