i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .actually , both of them enjoy their life .but , there is difference between young people and older people .older people does nt have much energy like young people .they ve worked hardly for long time , and it s possible that they already saw many good things , and had experiences before .therefore , they ll not be interested in doing or enjoying many things .some old people really enjoy their life , but i think youung people can enjoy more than older people .for example , many old couple has traveling to some other countries because their son or daughter bought the ticket or tour plan for them .after the son got grew up , and when they can make money , and they can make some nice plan for parents .because parents worked hardly for family .however , parents really ca nt enjoy the tour .the travel has busy schedule , and they need to walk a lot .so , it can be a little bit tough for old people if somebody is not healthy enought to do .i saw many times when i had traveling .whenever we walked to new place , they sometimes said they did nt want to go because they re are already exhausted from another place .maybe , they can enjoy different things with different style .however , i do nt think they can enjoy like young people .i thought about that before , and actually , i hope i can travel to many other countries when i m younger .even though i do nt have enough money , but i think it s good idea to try it .i have different view with older people .and , i can see many new things , and can learn .there are some places that older people does nt go or are not allowed for entrance .i want to have much more experience before getting older .of course , i can enjoy my life when i m older , too .however , in my opinion is young people has more variety of chances to enjoy different things , and more activities because they have more energy to try everything .after the time passes , it wo nt come back again .so , i really think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
