nowadays , more and more students start to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .actually it is a very good way for they to succeed in their studying fields because of the following reasons .first , ideas and concepts are the roots of any study .if a student does not understand the ideas and concepts , how can he/she find relations with the real life ?facts are revelant to the ideas and concepts , but after ideas and concepts are discovered , then we can apply the ideas and concepts to the facts .so ideas and concepts are more important than facts .in addition , ideas and concepts can apply to problems while studying .as mentioned , they are the origins of the studies .therefore any problems related to the study should be based on the ideas and concepts or they can be expansions of the ideas and concepts .for instance , in geometry studies , there are a lot of theories in a circle .the theories are the concepts and ideas .from these theories , teachers can develop more and more problems .if a student does well in the circle test , he/she must have mastered the ideas and concepts of the circle very well .or he/she would not get good mark just by learning facts .futhermore , while doing a lecture about some course , the students are required to expand his/her topic from the ideas and concepts .they are not taught to give the lecture right from the facts .because starting from the facts will make the lecture hard to be accepted by others who are not familiar with the topic .the ideas and concepts are always the basis of any lecture .afterwards , the facts can be displayed fully to the listeners .this is what a memorable lecture requires .in conclusion , ideas and concepts usually are the paramount factors of any study .therefore , it is more important for sutdents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .then they will be mastering knowledges better in the future .
