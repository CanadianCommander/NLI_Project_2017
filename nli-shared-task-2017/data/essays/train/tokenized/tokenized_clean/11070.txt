personally speaking , i totally disagree with this statement .first of all , i think young people do nt have the enough time to enjoy their lives .for example , young people , no mater where they are , will have to spend major of their time and energy `` starting  their lives instead of enjoying their lives .they have to spend 8 or more hours working everyday and even work overtime on weekends .and i am not surprised to see young people working like dogs .as a result , they are short of time to enjoy their lives .while on the contrary , old people , on a large part , have retired from their work .so understandably , with all the time available , they can set out to enjoying their lives either by staying at home and watching tv all day without worrying about the work load or traveling around the world to different places .second , young people do nt have the necessary amount of money to enjoy life .because the majority of young people s income is spent to support the whole family and to maintain their competitive advantages in their own fields by often taking up some training programs , they barely have any extra money to enable them to enjoy life .however , with all the saving the old people have made during all those years and no further need for them to get promoted , they can safely begin to enjoy their lives in whatever way they want to enjoy .finally , with the demand of their work and their family , young people never get around to thinking about how they can enjoy their lives and the fact that they do nt exactly know what life is , due to their limited life experience , has enormously deterred young people to enjoy their lives to the greatest extent .but on the other hand , old people have experienced a lot in their own life course , they well know what life is and how they can enjoy it and consequently , old people enjoy life more than young people do .
