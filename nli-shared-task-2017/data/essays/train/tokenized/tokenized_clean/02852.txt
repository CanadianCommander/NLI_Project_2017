as far as i am concerned , i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays young people would like to attentd other activities and seldomly think about that they help the communities .i will account for my reasons as follows .first of all , young people have so many activities that they would not to consider to help the communities .on the leisure time , they will make plans to go out with friends or spend time on computer .hence , because they have too many activities to choose , they mabe have a little chance to take the communities into account .secondly , nowadays we are not so familiar with the people who resident in the same community .therefore , if yound people are asked to help community , they may be doubtful that why they should help the community or the people who they do nt acquaint .because of lacking the cohision and the concept that we like family in the same community , yound people wo nt spend time on helping their communities .finally , in the educational system , parents and teachers may teach young people to attend the activities in the communities .however , the concept does not achieve through doing it physicially .the concept is just like a sign which is taught by parents and teachers .furthermore , nowadays parents are so busy that they wo nt encourge their children to help the communities .in conclusion , there are many solid evidences to proof that young people do nt spend enough time to help their communities .hence , i agree the statement .
