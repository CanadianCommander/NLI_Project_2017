academic subjects that a student takes will help him get into the school , college or the university that he wants .what subjects should a student study ?how many subjects should he/she study ?all these questions confuse each and every student in the whole world .if a student specialised in one specific subject , he/she will have many advantages and disadvantages facing him .starting with the advantages , we will find that this student will feel comfortable and happy as there will be no pressure on him .moreover , the student will know what he/she is going to specialise in as he/she get into college or university and will not the trouble of being confused later in his life .however , the student will face lots of trouble if the specialisation does not suit him .and if the student wishes to change the subject , this will not benefit him/her as he/she will have to start all over again and waist lots of time ; and as i was once told `` time is like gold , if u do not benefit from it you will lose it  .on the other hand , if a student has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , he/she will have less disadvantages than the advantages .firstly , he/she will switch into any other specialisation when feels like it , if the student finds that the first one did not suit him/her without waisting any time .furthermore , this will help the student in his/her life outside university as he/she will have lots of general and specific information and knowledge .in my opinion the only disadvantage here , is that he/she will have a huge pressure on him and will have lots of hard time .summing up all those ideas , i agree with the statement and would prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .although i will have hard time , but this will save me the trouble of facing the above disadvantages .just as my friend once did and told me `` i do not regret it at all  .
