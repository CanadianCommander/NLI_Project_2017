nowaday , bill gates is the first wealth on the hearth .he has constructed it on a very famous firm , microsoft .this latter month a new product has been launched , windows vista which is a new software which enable every people to work more efficenctly with their computer .what is that product ?only a old software which has been improved .this leads to my point of view .according to me , successful people are those who develope products based on their previous experience and knowledge .if we spend so much time at the university is to gather and increase our knowledge to pretend to a good job .at the time being it is almost impossible to succeed in the unknown .every people who has succeeded started with a familliar topic .how can we be good in something we do not know at all .a business to be launched needs strong basis or it is deemed to fail .once it is properous then we can decided that something new could be done .when a manager points out that the bounds are reached and that the business is not growing anymore , at that time he can decided to find a new strategy or a new product .new investment must be the only way for a firm to survive the growing competition .but it is not necessary to change completely the product the firm is selling .pizza hut for example , to revive the business , invented the cheezy crust pasta .the product is still a pizza but that pizza is improved to `` grab  new consumers , increase the profit and be better than other competitors .so , successful people has develope a thing they were knowing very well , improved it and then renew that thing when the time has come to find new found by extended the market .the subject is innovation .many people who tried to succeed in something they do not know at all were a lot to fail .that is what we witnessed in france at the begining of 2000 .a lot of new firms were started on the internet thing but many of them were completely ignorant of that totally new thing and the result was appaling , more than 80 percent of those firms closed during the first year .
