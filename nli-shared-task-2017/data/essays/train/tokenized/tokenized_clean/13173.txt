people may quickly get wrong when they say that specialzing in one specific subject is better than to have knowledge of many subjects .to some extent being specialized would be beneficial to the person .however it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .becouse with the development in science and technology it is revealed that every field is somewhat connectted to other ones , and it is now the time for the most qualifed canditate to find a position to pursue a good career .fistly , each day we hear something new about science and technology and most of the time we are suprised to see how differennt fields are linked together .to illustrate , medical science began to cooperate with computer science and they are using these technologies to learn more about human and trying to find treatment technologies for various health related issues .a medical doctor should also have at leat a minor degree or broad knowledge in computer science for example .secondly , dramaticly growing population brings a problem to the front .more competition is now waiting for us .therefore we should equip ourselves with whatever we could find .there could be also majoring in different areas .consequently , we become more attractive to the employers since we achive more with less effort and we could have a much broader view of perspektif when looking into problems .for example an engineer with a double major in economics or business administration could do a job almost two people can do and also can be able to think thoroghly with engineering aspects and with the say economical aspects of the problem .a whole understading to the problems could be achibev by acquiring more and more knowledge about different things .to sum up , in the search of exellence and success one has to consider equiping himself with more and more knowledge and therefore experience to overcome the competition .becouse we now know that every field is linked to each other and we sould have something in our mind when considering problem solution .
