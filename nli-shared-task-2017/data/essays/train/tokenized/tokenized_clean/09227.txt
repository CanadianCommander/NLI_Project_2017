the question about whether it is better to have a broad knowledge or to be specialized is very controversial .one may argue that it is preferable to be familiar with as many subjects as possible , since this will lead to be better suited to different situations .on the other hand , there is the claim that since human knowledge is so broad that it is not only impossible but unpratical to avoid specialization .as a final position , i ll argue why nowdays its better to specialized .in paticular , i will illustrate this by explaining the situation of nowdays mathematicians .first i would like to explain why to have a meaninful broad knowledge is almost impossible .by meaninful knowledge , i understand an amount suited to do reasearch on a specific subject or make contributions to it .just considering the especific case of mathematics , nowdays it has become so broad that even a master thesis may be hardly understood by people not specialized in the subject .so if someone is not specialized in any field , there are chances that he will not understand the state of the art of the mathematical sciences .even , there is people who tries to specialized in every possible fields , and what generally happends is that the person becomes a very good lecturer but a poor researcher .my point is that mathematics is too broad to avoid specialization .so the aim of obtaining a broad mathematical knowledge will lead to someone that would hardly be able to excel as a researcher .this leads to my second argument .nowdays an academic person is many times measured based on the amount of original results he produces .that means that not only the person is required to be on the edge of our knowledge , but aquainted enough with it so that to understand how to and be able to expand it .so in order to obtain a possition as a researcher is better for him to be specialized .and as a matter of fact , only a researcher can aim for a trully broad knowledge in a particular science .as a conclusion , given the fact that it is impossible to have and unpractical to aim for a broad knowledge in mathematics , it is even less desirable in general .
