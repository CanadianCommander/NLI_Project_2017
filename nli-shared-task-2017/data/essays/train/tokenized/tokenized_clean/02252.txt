throughout our education life , we have been subjects of different kinds of teaching styles .some teachers teach through making the students learn the facts , while others try to make students understand the rationale behind the fact .also  , no matter what the teaching style of the instructor is , some students focus on understanding the idea while others prefer to learn the facts .in my opinion , a student should first try to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts , because ideas help students build a vision , they are more implementable and they are easier to keep in mind .first of all , when a student understands a new concept , it adds to that individuals  vision .every concept or idea you understand makes you a person with a larger view of life .it will help you see daily events see in a different way .however , if you only learn the facts , they will be minor memories in your brain ; they wo nt help you built your personal experience quota .for example , when i learned about some concepts of behavior in my ` organizational behavior  class , my perspective of looking to my everyday relations have changed enormously .second , once an individual understands a concept or an idea , that will be implementable to every situation she/he will face in the future .while that individual is trying to make a decision on something , that concept will automatically come to his/her mind thus helping with the solution .for example , at enginnering college , i learned the concept of ` muda  which is a japon word for loss .if our professor only taught it by a specific fact saying that you should eliminate any extra loss in a specific machine , then that would be too narrow .however , she taught us the concep so i could implement it to my light at home .forgetting your light turned on while you are not in the room casus muda whch is a loss that can be eliminated .lastly , concepts and ideas that are understood well are easier to keep in mind whereas specific facts memorized are harder to remember after a certain period of time .i remember reading in amn article that you forget 75 % of the things you memorize in the first 24 hours and 90 % percent in the second day .therefore , the facts learned wo nt be with you for a long time ; however , the ideas that you managed to understand will stay with you for a lifetime .as a conclusion , i definitely agree with the statement suggesting that students  understanding of ideas is more crucial than their learning of facts .students should focus on understanding the concepts because the ideas will be more permanent , they will be more applicable and they will help them create better views of life .
