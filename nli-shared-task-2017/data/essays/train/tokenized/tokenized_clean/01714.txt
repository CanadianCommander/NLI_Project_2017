think of a quantum physics professor who joins a reception and is in a conversation with people from very different fields .he could be the best in his field , he might have won countless prizes on his theories about quantum computers , but he might look like a complete fool when the conversation is about the ideas brought on by franz kafka in his book `` metamorphosis  .that is , if our professor has focused only on his own subject and left out all the other ones , failing to create himself a general culture .as i tried to give an idea of a man who has focused only on a specific subject with my example above , i think that one has to have certain knowledge on all fields if he/she wants to gain some reputation among people of the same standard , even if he/she might be the best in his/her own field .although you have to spend most of your time on the subject you are specialized in , in order to be succesfull , the requirements are much higher in today s world .you ca nt just give up on all other aspects of life and isolate yourself from other academic subjects , being a stranger to what the majority of the world is talking about .this is why students are constantly being tested on topics they might not be interested in , nowadays .although cries of anguish like `` when will a person like me who s trying to become a computer engineer will ever use the characteristic of sonnets  in shakespeare s poems ?  are constantly being heard in school corridors , it is essential that one learns certain knowledge about every topic he/she can , even if it may seem trivial at first .this time , think of a quantum physics professor who knows a lot more than only quantum computers .think of a well dressed professor who has something to say , even if it is very brief , on any topic that is brought on .think of how much more he ll be respected than the ingorant one i talked about at the beginning of my essay .think how much better a society could be even if half of its population consisted of people who tried to learn more on every topic .they would communicate in a much complex and in a much more humanistic way than the majority of the world does today , would nt they ?
