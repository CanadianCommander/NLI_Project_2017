it s actually hard for me to take a firm position about this topic , as often happens to me when i am in front of this type of absolute statements ; i will therefore try to explain why for me the statement is true and false at the same time .considering first the physical aspect , it can not be denied that a lot of energy runs through young and healthy subjects veins and just for this simple reason they enjoy the things of life more , literally .moreover we have to consider that young people vision of life is unlimited , meaning with this that they look at life as something that is not going to end ; at least not soon .the latter provides them with more reasons and energies to enjoy their existence .my young brother , aged 7 , for example is able to play all day long without rest enjoying every single moment and feeling very intense emotions and , importantly , with not many worries and responsabilities .i envy him .on the other hand , while the quality of life is underestimated by youngsters , while elder people know ( or should know ) what is the value of life , because they are not left with much of it .they appriciate more consciously the gift of life .they can use their wisdom to make better choices .they do nt feel things with the same intensity of the time when they were young , which even mean that they do nt feel sufferings so intensively .the know exactely what they want , and they feel less lost in any kind of situation .my grandmother for example is 97 and now she is in a facility hospital .she does not move around so much as she s on a wheel chair but . ..well , the way she smiles when my mother or i go visit her , you can really tell that she is valuating that little episode in a way that a young and in a good shape person would nt be able to do , because he | she would likely be very worried about the future , the job , and many other things .in the end it depends on the personal attitude , as always .
