i agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts tahn it is for them to learn facts .is is because that way to studay is more efficient t ostudents in terms of three points ; valiety , memory , and interests .first of all , by understanding the ideas and concepts , they can get valiety skills to solve many problems .in other words , they can use those information or learning in other fields or other problems .for in stance , in mathmatiucs some people try to memorize only the main folmulas and skip to the examples without understnading the concepts .as a result , they might be able to solve problems in one particular field or problem ; instead of that , they can not solve in other parts because they just try to think and use from examples .secondly , if students understnad the ideas and concepts , it helps them to memolize those for a long time .for , they connect some explanations or additional information with facts .if they do not do that and just memorize only the facts , they will forget easily becasue of no connection map in their brains .for example , as fpr history .if they remember the fact that a war happned during a period . ..how can they keep it in thier memory without haveing any reasoins why it happens or who did it .finally , the best way to learn for students is to enjoy the study .also in this point , the idea works well .actually it s connected to second paragraph , but not only keeping the information in thiere brains for a loing time , it make the study more fun .the reason is that they have to use their brains a lot to understand ideas and concepts and connect with each other ; therefore students can learn without getting bored .it is the closest way to make acchievement on their study .in conclusion , bcasue od valiety , memory , and interests , student should undersatnd the concepts and ideas first
