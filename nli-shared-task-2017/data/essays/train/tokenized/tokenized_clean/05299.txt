i certainly agree to the statement and there are conspicuous examples which make me believe this way .firstly it is anchored in the `` nature  of advertisements that they make products seem much better as they are .you must only ask yourself some quite simple questions .what are the intentions of the advertisement making people ?why are there advertisements in nearlly every places all over the world ?and so on .the explanation can be introduced by only one single word : `` money !.do nt belive advertisements have been evolved to inform people about the best products , they have been evolved to make you buy a product without regarding its quality .there are several examples .for instance if you want to buy a fat-burner you will find a lot of different products all promising achievements in a very short period of time , but if you try them out there will be nearly no achievement at all .moreover the advertisement has fulfilled its purpose , because you have bought the product .an other example is advertisement for cigaretts .think about the notorious marlboro-country and ask yourself if you really feel like a cowboy enjoying the lonelyness and endlessness of the prarie when smoking a marlboro .this example leads to the next paragraph .advertisements want to present their product in the most typical way with refernces to the consumer .let me explain this a little bit more .would a company which sells tuning parts for cars let play the main role of there spot by a gay guy .definately not !there would by promiscuous women as well as `` real-men  representing the product because it would be more convincing to the people buying these products than a gay guy .so the advertisement exists in a reciprocal relationship with the consumer .this is necessary if the advertisement making people want to reach their goal .to make you buy their product .as a conclusion i would like to assert that the advertisement which represents its product objectively does not exist .
