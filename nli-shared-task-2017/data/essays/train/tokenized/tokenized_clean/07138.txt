i must say that i totally agree with the statement .as a student , i personally find more importsnt and useful to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .what is more , i think that the really important thing is not only to understand these ideas and concepts but also to study , to examine and to see how an idea or a concept leads to another and , thus , how facts appear as a part of the process , not as isolated things that are recorded in our memory .understanding ideas and facts help students , and people in general , to develope their logic and their analytical capacities .for example , let  s talk about the french revolution .to me , it is easier and more useful to study it not as an amount of dates , facts , names , events , etc , but as a conclussion of the social and political situation of europe in the 18th century : one thing leads to another and , at the end , studying it can even be funny , as a film in your mind , better than a long and boring list of non-sense words .furthermore , i consider memory a bad friend : you trust in it and , when you most need it , it leaves you alone , with no other help .when taking and exam , for example .if in your mind there are only facts , you can forget one and being unable to continue with the answers .on the contrary , if you have all the understanding process in your mind , maybe you won  t be able to give a concrete date or a name , but you can explain the context or give other information that can help you to avoid a total disaster .to sum up , i think that understanding ideas and concepts will help us more than learning facts by heart , not only in our academic life but also in our everyday life .
