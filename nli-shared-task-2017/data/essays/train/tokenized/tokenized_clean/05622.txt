i disagree with the concept of having a general knowledge of a broad variety of subjects compared to specialization in one field .in my opinion it is better to focus on one academic subject because it achieves more and the achievement is more thorough .in todays competitive world , i understand the importanceof having knowledge , regarding various subjects , but i think , such knowledge should be pursued at lower levels of education , such as college or high school , to develop the overall personality of the student .however , in higher education specialization is a must , since , it provides greater opportunities for the future and experience during the period of training .for example , if you look around , those doctors who do not pursue a specialty course ( general practioners ) tend to do well in their practice , but those who do specialize , run a spectacular practice .this is relevant to both the nature of cases treated and the salary earned .the specialist sees rare cases , reffered to him by the general practioner , increasing his knowledge in his chosen field .he is better able to treat the condition and naturally earns more , as well .another example - on comparing the jobs allotted to postgraduates with those allotted to the graduates , one can see the preference is given to the former .a law student is more likely to be recruited with a prestigious firm than the average high school pass-out .experience plays an important role here , because there is channelisation of forces acting to achieve the higher goal .also , if one wants a broad knowledge of subjects , the number of goals naturally increases .this requires time , effort and money .consequently , efficiency is greatly reduced and complete knowledge of each subject can be easily compromised .in my experience as a student i realised i did well in the years when i had thre subjects to cover in undergraduate school as compared to when i had four subjects .in all fairness , subjects in each year required intensive reading .similarly , i have noticed that the class valedictorian , usually , excels in one or two subjects and not each subject , clearly showing how difficult it is to master each .`` the jack of all trades , the master of none .i would not llike to be associated with that phrase because i think it undermines the motivation to succeed .success , for me is the attainment of a goal , which requires focus .if there are numerous paths to follow then success can not be gained beacuse of loss of focus .i believe in a firm foundation of knowledge of many topics upon which i can build my expertise ,, just like a plane wih a braod middle and a pointed tip , which is in conformity with the principles of aerodynamics .
