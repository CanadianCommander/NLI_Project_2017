it is generally agreed that the younth enjoys life more than the older generation does .however , i will explain why i am not a strong advocate of this belief .firstly , most students have a lot of work to do for their studies .as a student in an engineering school , i have to work a lot in order to pass my exams .i donot have too much time to spend with my friends .my parents have more time to invite friends and to attend to cultural events .i am looking forward to having as much free time as they do .a lot of retired people are in a good shape and are travelling a lot to discover the world .i am personally convinced that many of them are enjoying life more than i do .it should also bear in mind that when we have a job in a company , we are independant and it is for me a top priority .we have the opportuny to spend our money as we wish .we can set up a family and spend a nice time with our children .i woud really appreciate to bring up my chidren and to do my best to enable them to be well educated .i know that before this , i will have to work very hard to be allowed to go to the universty of my dreams .above all , it should not be brushed under the carpet that many young people suffer from the lack of assistance .some of them even commit suicide .also , some teenagers have to face drug problems that have tremendous effects on their health .i think that much remains to be done to decrease the rate of these dramatic addictions .to conclude , i back that young people do not always enjoy life as much as the older generation d. i think that authorities should focus more on the ways to help more the younth .
