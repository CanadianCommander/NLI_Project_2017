i believe that in the next twenty years there will be decline in the number of cars used today .there are a few reasons why i think so firstly with the immense growth in the population and scarcity of space available to live and commute would decrease the number of cars .this is because travelling on the public transport would be much more convenient than standing in the long traffic jams .second reason would be coming up of highly safe and convenient public transport systems .the government is working on such issues and by the end of twenty years would have excellent transportation system like public buses , trains , trams and metros which can take the person to his destination in much less time than the individual cars .e.g in capital of india i.e. delhi , with the coming up of metros a lot of time is saved by the people working and commuting through cars .third reason i believe is spiralling prices of gas and petrol because of huge demand .this high cost of driving cars would discourage their use in coming years and will lead to fewer cars in use than there are today .the non-renewable sources of energy used to drive cars are getting finished up slowly and slowly and fifty years from now would be a time when we would have no fuel left .so switching to public transport will also solve the problem and slow the process of depletion of these resources .also with the increase in inflation in indian economy , the common man is looking for alternate means to cut down the costs .so if a much viable and convenient solution is available then he would surely switch over to the use of cheap and better modes of transport .all these reasons combined would make the common man to willingly come out of his luxury of cars and use cheap and time - effective means of transport like buses , trains etc .
