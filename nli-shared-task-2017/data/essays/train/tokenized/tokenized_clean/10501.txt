i agree that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  because their main purpose is to sell people their product of service , and they would do whatever it takes to increase their profits .a typical example of this marketing strategy would be the advertisements used in the food industry .some cans , boxes or bags show their products really big , juicy and seeming tasty .however , when the costumer opens the product , he sees that the product is much smaller and most of the time is not even similar to the product they were showing in the package .some fast food restaurants also show tasty pictures of their products , usually hamburguers , hot dogs , or sandwiches .these meals seem to be much bigger than they really are , with fresh vegetables and soft bread .but when the costumer actuallly recieves the meal , it turns out to be a small common burger .no only the food industry uses those tricks .a major industry that not only highlights the product itself , but the benefits it offers to the final user , is the beauty industry .this industry includes make ups , magic pills , gel or creams and all sort of products that promess to make someone beautiful , skinnier of younger .when trying to sell their newest product .it is typical to see the `` before and after  ads , showing a fat lady and then after taking the pills , or applying the gel or cream , she looks much better , skinny and healthy .a variety of examples could be provided of how marketing people maximize the products  capacities .but the thing is that they actually do it and it is not properly regulated .this is not only unethical for the costumer who buys the product , but for the potential costumer who is thinking about purchasing it .in my opinion , the solution for this problem is legal regulation .i think that all products  ads that show better products than they actually are , should be taken away from the stores .besides , if any client complains about a product that did not met his or her expecations based on the product advertisement , should get their money back .if a proper solution is not implemented , more people will be affected and finally , the company will loose actual and potential costumers , since no one wants to be mocked again .and a costumer that is lost , is lost forever .
