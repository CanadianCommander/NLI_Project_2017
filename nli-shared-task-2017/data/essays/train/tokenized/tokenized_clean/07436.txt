young people are the fundamental building blocks of any community .they are its foundation , whether it be culturally , politically or even socially .i believe that young people contribute precious time to helping their communities as they are well sensitised to the problems that it faces .the youth of any country is an essential ingredient in the larger matrix of a well-knit community .young people , through various media and other fora , like television , the internet , are exposed to the grond realities in their community .education also informs them about the problems plaguing their community , and modes and methods of resolving these problems .for example , by the constructive use of demonstrations and petitions , students in india have been at the vanguard of a silent yet sturdy movement seeking to transform the current status quo of lethargy and sloth in politics into one of efficiency and nimbleness .with the advent of the internet , the young people have found an articulate mouthpiece .they are frequently expressing their opinions through blogs and what have you may .owing to their adaptive and dynamic nature , the youth has its finger firmly on the community s pulse .with the rapid pace with which the different forms of communication emerge , the youth are sure to become major shareholders in the future from being mere stakeholders as of now .however , such fervour on part of the youth should be guided by experienced and responsible members of the community .at times , unregulated action by the youth has led to catastrophies .for example , during the cutlural revolution in china , the red guards , as the youth was referred to , at the behest of chairman mao zedong , without any inkling as to how to improve their society , lead to the killing and slaughter of intellectuals , the very intellectuals who were agents of change in the community .in conclusion , the youth has done its fair share of community service .in fact , they have been welcome agents of change amidst a sea of senility and inaction by previous generations .the role essayed by them will only increase in size and stature as time progresses .
