the mass production of cars started in the past century and has nt stopped ever since , causing a great deal of problems in terms of environmental and social issues .these problems were almost immediately discussed since the early times of the car industry adfirmation .the fordian assembly line model has been depicted by charlie chaplin in his notorious movie `` modern times  , and many american pop artists started giving a representation of the american love for cars , thing that has been determined mainly by a social transformation occurred since the fifties : middle class people started moving to the suburbs and needed a car to be connected to the city , where their jobs were usually located , and often also their kids  schools as well .nowadays this kind of sociological and geographical transformation may be witnessed in many different parts of the world .urban sprawl and the presence of strip malls are common in many parts of italy , germany , france and many other european and asian countries as well as in the united states .at the same time civic authorities are not always able to address transportation problems , with the result that most of the people in rich and developing countries end up considering their cars the principal and favourite of all means of transportation .in big cities and suburbs the top users of public transportation are always recent immigrants that do nt own a car yet , and young students .if there s something that would be able to invert this trend and motivate more people to use their car less , that is the fuel cost that s getting higher and higher every year .but in my opinion even this would rather lead to a transformation in the kind of fuel used in the future , hopefully sustainable and recyclable , than to a reduction of car users in the world .
