i agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i believe that trying new things and taking risks are good for us .because doing such things will bring new knowleages and experiences for us .and we are growing now , so , we do not know that what is best things for me yet .for example , my brother loves to play baseball and he plays very well , so he desires to be baseball player in future .but i want to recommend him to play other sports .because he never plays other soprts before so he does not know that how much fun doing other sports are .maybe , if he plays other sports , he can finds more interesting sports than baseball .i think we have to be more active in order to be successful people .i think successful people are not afraid of making mistakes , so they can try new things and take risks .i am taking spanish class in high school .but i do not wanted to take it before taking it , because i am japanese , so studing english is too much for me .but i feel taking spanish is very fun and i think that i want to study more .learnig onother language brought me new opinions and new world .so i am able to speak spanish now , i can make new people who talk spanish , too .trying new things and taking risks are hard , and people want to avoid such things .but trying is important for us to grow up and to be successful people .when we talk with successful people , we can find facts that they have many knowleages because they have many experiences include bad and good .this awares them something .do not be afraid , you can try new things even if you make mistakes , you can try again .that experience that you did try is not waste thing in your life .you can have confidence .
