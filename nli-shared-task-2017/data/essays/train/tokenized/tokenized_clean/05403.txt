i think most people think that the most important is a learning .thus , i disagree with this statement that it is more important for stduents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts beacuse students need to know about the facts .moreover , if studnets know the facts , they can have higher quility conversation .first of all , students have to know about the facts because they are an idividuals in the world .for example , i have read a news about a girl .one day , she walked to home .she felf that someone was following her .she was afraid of it .she wish the other man lived same apartment .a man kept following her and the other man also was following her .when she arrived at home , she had to take an elevator .the man who walked with her , he also took same elevator and got off same floor .he talked to her that there were a man who is murderer so i followed you .this happen was really serious .moreover , after she got this experiecne , she realized that the facts is so difficult .in addition , if students learn facts , they can talk to adult about it .for example , i always talk to my father about society .my father also tell me many things about it .thus , when i talk to another older people , i can talk to them very easily .in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is the most important for students to learn facts becuase they can have experiences and when we talke to people , opposition people think that we are smart .
