most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .most people will not doubt about it , while others think quite differently on the issuse of the advertisements do nt make products seem much better .personally , i stand on the side of the advertisement make products seem much better .there are three conspicuous concepts as follows .firstly , this is because of the simple fact that the examples you will meet in your life .many many times , when we see the advertisements in the tv or any where , the products in the advertisement are very perfect , excellent , so after receiving them , you are very disappointed .the real products are not like the patterns in the advertisements .secondly , we could cite another ordinary example of that the advertisements are also the businesses , they also want to get the money from the customers .so sometime , when they do the advertisements , they do nt worry about the quality of the products , and maybe they do nt understand the detail informations about the products , they just focus on how do the advertisements , how to make the customers to trust what they said .thirdly , i may say that the advertiser are not the experts about the different areas .so they just need to make the advertisements look better , and let the customers believe the products , let the producer get the maximum profits , this is the rule of the market .certainly , some advertisements also do the good job .they just tell the truth about the products to customers .and try not to give the wrong information to public .so some people believe that most advertisements do nt make products seem much better than they really are .of course , arguments will be against my standpoints , many people might argue that my opinions also have some drawbacks , such as there are still some good advertisements .i might reply that most important things are multifaceted , there are many alternatives to choose from , each with uniqe advantanges and disadvantanges .i advocated my viewpoints because i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .above all this points , i support to statement because it is better to know that the advertisements are also businesses , their main goal is also the profit , the money .so we should nt give the advertisements more belives .
