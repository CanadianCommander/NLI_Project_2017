there are two ways to learn something , the first it is studing by heart and the second is to undestand the basic idea of the topic .i think that is better to lear the idea of a concept , and not to lear it by heart , although i think that studing as the first way it s also important sometimes , it also depends on what a student have to learn .in my experience , i found more useful to understand instand of memorize some concepts , for example take a mathematical topic .it s pretty impossibile to apply some theorems or forumulae if we have not undestood what them are dealing about .mathematic it s beautiful , because you have only to understand the concepts , and after that apply all the rules that you have learned to a real problem .if a student studies by heart these mathematical concepts he will never be able to solve any problem that is nt but methodologic .otherwise , in my opinion , there are other concepts that are very difficult to memorize only undesting their ideas .an example my be a law topic , because students studing to became a lawyer , have to learn by heart many concepts and many rules that they necessary need to know to make their future job , and not only to undestand what their are studing or what about is the paper that they are reading .in the end , i think that a person , or a student , does nt have to make an absolute choice between `` understanding the ideas  and `` studing by heart  , but he needs to find the right tradeoff to get his culture performed and to improve as better his knwoledge .
