i do nt agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .as for me , traveling is kind of like trausure hunting .why traveling is always interesting ?that s becuase a unknown futrue .once u are on the way , you ll never know what will happen or who will u meet .every experience will be like a surprising gift and ever friend will be your valuable fortune in your life .the best thing to explore the world on your own is to crate memories by yourself .some people would think it s convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spots right away .that way , you do nt have to wasting too much time finding places .and even the tour guide could explain the information or historic stories to let you know without a book .actually , the tour guide nowadays only shows the travelers to the spots who can make them money .the rush schedule and the arrangement from a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel .most of people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind .the point i want to make is the real meaning of travel is not only to relax yourself but also to learn the experience from the real world , not from the book anymore .it s not hard to arrange a safe and fun tour by yourself .before you go to travel , you can collect much information from the internet , your friends who have ever been there or even the traveling books .through the suggestions they give you , and do a well prepartion in advance , there s no doubt you ll have a wonderful tour without a tour guide .you can freely charge your time of staying or decide what kind of places you prefer to visit .
