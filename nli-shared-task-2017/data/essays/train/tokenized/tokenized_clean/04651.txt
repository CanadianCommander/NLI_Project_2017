i disagree with this statement because i do nt think that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important than to specialize in one specific subject .in many kinds of careers , there are many careers which need the specialized skill in the process .there are several reasons .first , in executing the work , if we have more specialized knowledge in the working process we can do the work more exactly and fastly than the people who has not specialized knowledge .for example , a friend of mine has specialized knowledge in business marketing field more than others so now he has a splendid job in a famous big company and he is executing the work excellently and many co-workers are respecting him and his working skill .second , in some case , the people who has not specialized knowledge may not execute the work at all .for example , my major is architecture , exactly interior design .in architecture field , if the planner or designer has not special skill or knowledge about structure and resist for many thing ( water , wind , heat ) , he can not design the tall building , airport , school even if small house .for above statement , in this world , there are many kind of works which need the specialized skill not only architecture field .so we have to learn about many knowledge in the specific subject to work for the specific field .finally , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is just only memorising the britaniker dictionary .with these many knowledge we can only use the knowledge at small and paltry question and we can not use the knowledge at specialized work field .if we want to have a good job for me making much money and feeling happy with our job , we have to have the specialized knowledge in our specific subject or field .
