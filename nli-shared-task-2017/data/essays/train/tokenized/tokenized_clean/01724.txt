being successful and happy is the main aim of many people .there is an ongoing debate about whether sucess is achieved by trying new things and taking risks rather than only doing what has been known well .in my point of view , people who are doing what they are know how to do well have more possibilty to become successful .the main reason for my point is that there is less uncertainity when people do things they know well .because , when there is uncertainty we may not be sure whether we are on the accurate way or not .it is an inevitable factor that in order to be successful , we need to work regularly .under uncertain situations , planning is a very hard task .thanks to the certainty , we can plan our tasks and follow our progress clearly .also , people learn to be more efficient by doing things they know .another reason for my point is we may only waste our time and money by trying new things .according to researches , most of the research and development projects are resulting with failure .instead of trying new things , if we concentrate on what we are doing best , we can oproduce more favorable outcomes .another reason for my point is dependency of trying new things mostly on luck factor .may be some people are lucky to be successful by trying new things .but these people are very limited in number .we only heard stories about people who took risk and become success in publications .what about other people took risk and failed ?they confront with the hard face of life .whereas , most of the people who became successful has progressed step by step .i think it is not worth to risk my career and living standard in order to be successful .i prefer to be successful step by step with countinious working .to sum up , people become successful by doing what they are doing best .by doing so , they reduce uncertainy , they can do more clear plans and they achieve step by step .whereas , the other alternative way of being successful is quite dependent on luck and may result in only waste of resources .
