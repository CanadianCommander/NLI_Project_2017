success is about struggling about problems .if it was so easy , then it would nt be success .that s why , it is very important people to try new things and take risks rather than only doing usual things to succeed .everybody learns new things since he or she was borned .here , the point is to use these information accurately .people easily get used to the information they know .they get some habits easily as well .so they start to live with a rutin life .because it is not hard , it is so well-known .when they have to face a diffuculty , they surprice , they do not know what to do .they do not want to change their lives .however , a person who always takes risks and tries new things , only tries to understand the situation .he or she first makes sure that knows the problem .than that person thinks about solutions .if it is needed , then takes risks or struggles .i believe that life is full of difficulties .nobody serves success to people in a tray .therefore , people are always ready to face difficulties .they should not prevent them to achieve their goals .i strongly believe that to be successful is only about working hard , not about chance or not about capacity .for example , one of my nephews is very smart .at school , he only listens the teacher .he does nt take notes or even does nt ask any question .after that , if he studies at home only once in a week , he passes all his tests .but if he does nt studies until his tests , he never passes even though he is very smart .he has to try too .another example is my best friend .she inspires me a lot .she recommends me something all the time .i listen her very carefully .because she has lots of experiences .her family is not a wealthy family .so , since the beginning of her life she had finacial problems .she got worried a lot .but , it never stopped her for anything .she could nt take any private lesson to prepare to college .but after the college exam , we won the same colege .now , she work hard to make her other dreams true .in conclusion , i met many successful people .the one common thing i saw on them was to believe to try new things .it brings success .if people do not take risks , it will be hard them to achieve their goals .trying new things always teach new things that might help people in somewhere in their lives .
