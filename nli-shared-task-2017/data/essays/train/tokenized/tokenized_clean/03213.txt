i completely agree with this statement .there is no point in knowing facts without capturing the essence of the ideas .this applies to all fields of study .as a civil engineering student in mexico city i had to learn many formulas and techniques to solve many problems .we would concentrate mainly on structural design , having to learn to apply these methods by heart .there was not much sence in learning the formula because in the real world we are able to open a book .the real important part came when we had to understand the effects and the causes that interact with the structure at study .a good engineer is the one that really understands the structural behavior of what he is building .the same applies to a history student .there is no point in knowing all the exact dates of historical events if there is no understandig of the essence of the study .what good would it do if the student does not have a feel on how a culture lived , what they ate or what they thought which lead to the historical event .the dates will stay in almanacs forever but the real learning comes from understandig the ideas and the concepts .schools today tend to lean towards a more understanding way of teaching .they focus mainly on atracting the student s attention by taking them on field trips or by having more interactive materials to teach with .computers and the internet help to visualize and understand concepts that would have been difficult to explain without them .there are also easier ways to obtain factual information now than before .this makes it almost useless for a student to learn the facts .they have to focus on understanding the ideas and be able to apply their knowledge in real life .the only way to do so is by having the right education .
