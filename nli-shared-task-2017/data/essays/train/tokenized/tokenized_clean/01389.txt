some people think that successful people always explore new things and taking risks of it .however , most people will think that people do things what they know how to do well are also success .in fact , we should determine the people are success or not in different ways .first of all , people who are success by taking risks are mostly because they are lucky .investing money to a company , for example , you can gain a lot of money from it by the company getting bigger and bigger , but in the other way , you might also lose a lot of money because the company is closed .when you gain money , it is not because you are smart .when you lose money , it does not means that you are not having ability .it is just because being success sometines just depends of your luck , but not your ability .however , in contrast , in sometimes , trying new things can bring people success .for example , the inventers are always try to discover new things that we do not recognize at all .they are successful because they have an ability to invent new things , and not for luck .the last but not least , people keep doing things they already know how to do well does not mean he/she is not successful , although most lower-classes is just keep doing same things in every time .for instance , all of the engineers always repair a same things each time , but they are usually high educated .in fact , no one will say that engineers are not successful .as a result , to define a people is success or not , we should not only consider he/she if she tried new things or not , but also think of the other ways , such as if he has a high education or not .
