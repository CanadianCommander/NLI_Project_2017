i sadly have to agree somehow to the statement and say that it is true .most people my age prefer to do senseless things in order to get engaged in their community .one could say , it is a kind of responsibility and duty we all have for our community .instead of helping at some festivals or meeting with old people , thez hang around at some place smoking cigarettes or even take drugs , they play computer all day long without noticing that it has become spring or sit in front of the tv watching how a mutant hog shoots down a man in order to get the power over the earth .this is not reality .on the other hand , even if it is true , i would not have given a better example .the youth nowadays has to much to do with herself .there are friends they need to talk to , movies they have not seen yet , magazines they need to buy , besides other unrelevant trash they have to spend their money for .there simply is to much to do for them and no time left .another problem are their parents .there is nothing thez would more prefer than seeing their kid in an organisation that helps the community .even if could be fun , no young person would bz himself participate in such an organisation , because it is what his parents would like him to do .somehow , the youth always want to rebell .rebell against the parents , the commercial , the government , the law .the youth is contra , what is left pro and vise versa .i know that because i have been such a kid .against everything .but soon i found out that there is more than what the tv shows , what the friends say .i suddenly realised that it is a wonderfull feeling to help , to engage yourself or just to be around .i found out how much there was to see in my own town and community , and if i would prove myself active , what could be made better .at least i would like to give an opportunity of a solution .if they themselves offer the youths some activities interesting for them , like parties organized for the youth in some place in the city , they even could earn some extra money and have their youth involve
