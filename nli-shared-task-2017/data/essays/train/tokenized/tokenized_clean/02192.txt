how general or specializied studies should be is an issue that still trigers the education community wordwide .to a certain extent , i tend to agree with people who think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help students reacting better when facing new environments and challenges .first of all , today s challenges increase in complexity and involve various skills and knowledge to resolve them .for instance , terrorist threats create challenges for free movment of persons .as a lawyer , i can not advise the without an ethical dimension .having general knowledge on topics such as law , security policy and even philosophy , will help me dealing with the problem as a whole .second , i personaly think that having general knowledge will allow me to be quicker and flexible when dealing with new issues .it is a common place to say that general knowledge will help someone acquire specialized knowledge through experience .it will help him t turn to new subjects with ease , while a spealized student must encounter difficulties in learning to work on other topics .these considerations should however be balanced .since today s challenges are getting more complex , professionals are asked to have strong knowledge in their specific field of expertise .all in all , the best education is probably the one complementing general knowledge learned in school with specialized knowledge learned during professional life .
