i am kind of disagree with this statement .i agree that to understand ideas and concept are important , but to learn facts are also important .by understanding ideas and concept student learn how facts take place .it is not just once you understand ideas , you do need to worry about how facts happen .for example , my professor explained the process of the earthquack .she briefly described each and every detail about it .now i know how do earthquack happen , but what if i do not know the facts of it .how can i prove my concept about the earth quack , if i do not have the specific example .if i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia , and explain these are the reasons this happen over there more often , then i support my statement .my fact support my concept and ideas .happning of the earthquack in indonesia is a fact .i need to know it to understand my concept better .facts are important in order to understand the concept .you can not say that fact does not worth it .without fact no concept and no idea take place .facts are the life of the concepts .one more example here is that countries in sourthern hemishphere have warmer climate and countries in northern hemisphere have cooler climete .how can i proove this statement ?i will give all my geographic reasons and explanation .how can i proove all my geographic reasons ?now to have facts is important .if i say that united states is in northern hemishphere and that is why it is having cloor climate , and shri lanka is in southern hemisphere and that is why it is having warmar climate .this is the fact .my fact support my argument .fact are important to proove your statement .you can not just state something and agree with it without giving specific reasons and examples .basically , the facts are as important as concept and ideas .they both are equal .none of them is more important than the other .
