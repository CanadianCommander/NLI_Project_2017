the education system should provide the students with the ability to assimilate new ideas and concepts and comprehend their implications , rather than only stating the facts about a particular subject .the major reason for this is the very nature of the memory and the learning process .furthermore , in order to use the school knowledge in real life , students must have the capability to analyze the concepts .firstly , human beings tend to forget the facts ; however , if they analyze them and derive their own conclusions and ideas , they remember them for a long time .for example , in the history classes during my high school education , we were overexposed to a vast amount of historical facts and data , like the dates and places of wars , among which i remember only a few .in contrast , in my university education , i had the opportunity to take history classes in which the students had to read a lot of articles about a certain topic .the reading material consisted of diverse opinions about a historical fact or argument .in the exam , the students were asked to present their own opinion by referring to the information in the texts , analyzing them , and explaining in detail why they agree or disagree with certain parts of them .i still remember the arguments and the reasoning behind them , which have been very useful not only in my academic studies , but also daily life .secondly , merely memorizing the facts is insufficient to implement the school knowledge in real life , since it does not entail originality and creativity .after the students graduate and start working in the industry or in their daily lives , they are required to come up with new ideas and present solutions to the problems .in order to accomplish this , they have to have originality and creativity .the history classes in my university education have also provided me with this ability .for instance , while reading the articles in the newspapers , i can not only understand , but also criticize the writer s argument in its historical and political perspective .to conclude , i think that understanding ideas and concepts is much more beneficial for students than merely leaning the facts .this is both because they can remember the information much more easily and because they can implement their knowledge in real life situations through their originality and creativity .
