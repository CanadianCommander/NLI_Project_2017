although some people consider that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i disagree with this statement .there are mainly two reasons that makes me think it is false .fisrst of all : what does ` enjoying  mean ?i think that this term is too often associated with parties , and all these kinds of things that young people do .usually , young people enjoy going on holidays with friends , to the sea , to the mountain and so on .or they can have fun by organizing some big parties , or by going to music shows .that is the way the most of young people ` large it up  .but i think ` enjoying  life is more than that .maybe that older people have not the same expectations concerning their evenings and their life .for example , they meet friends to discuss or to play cards instead of dancing all night long .they may also be happy because they have children and they see them growing , and because they form a family .to conclude i think that enjoying life depends on what you mean by ` enjoying  , and that the criteria of enjoyment vary with the age of people .that is why i wrote that it is possible to enjoy life at an equal level , if you are a young person or an older person .
