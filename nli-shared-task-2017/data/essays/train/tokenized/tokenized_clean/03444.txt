most people usually tend to tell the facts without having explained the ideas and the concepts .this would have a worst impact on students .i think it is wrongly done and it would be a lot more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts .it is so for many reasons : less geniuses in the world , a non evolution of the world and the promotion of a non democratic system .by learning facts , the students will never gain a lot .they do not really understand , they will certainly know what they are said , will memorize it , but will never understand why is that , making them foolishes or machines with no brain .it would even be harder for him to memorize the facts .but on the other hand , if he understands the ideas and the concepts , he would be able to get to the facts on his own , without having to memrize them , perfectly knowing what is going on .understanding these concepts and ideas , the student works his brain and can even think of something new and way better .this is how the world grows and expands and the evolution goes .the student will also learn how to work on his own , express hiself , his opinions and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society .if they just learn the facts , it means that only one or a few persons will know the reasons , giving him or them the entire power over the others , the ability to make decisions as he wants , even if they are wrong or should not be done .i strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .we will build a more effective world that way , and promote the world solidarity .
