today , more and more often old people is showed by the society as slow and sad people .but this point of view is really restrictive and can not be share with everybody .first , to my mind , the definition of `` enjoying life  can change with your age : not because you can not enjoy like before but just because your mind change .for example , when you are a child , `` enjoying your life  is just to play with your games .when you begin to be a teenager `` enjoy life  is to begin go in clubs , in bars .when you are thirty years old , you need to enjoy life spending time with your friends or succeeding in your job .i think when you are young , it is really hard to understand enjoying life of older people because you did not discover what they lived and what they need .then i think anybody need to enjoy his own life with his own dream or his own hobbies .more when you become older , your body can accept everything it accept when you were young .something which was really sweet and so easy to do when you were young can become quickly hard and so strong .then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can become with your age really easy , funny or sweet .for example , to do go in clubs or do extrem sports can become really hard when you are older , and to learn chess can become really enjoying when you are older .to conclude , i do nt think every body can have the same one , because this term is linked to the target you gave to your life .this target can change and is too much personnal to be shared with everybody .and this is really hard for the different generation to understand why older or younger enjoying life with a another another activity which is not your view of `` enjoying life  .
