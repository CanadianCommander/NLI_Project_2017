i don not think the statement will come true in decades .nowadays private cars are more popular than ever .there is a trend for more cars in the future .many peole might think the cars have many disadvantages and will be fewer in years .they think if everyone is driving a car , the traffic will be in a jam , the air will be heavily polluted , and the expense on car maintainence and petrol fee will be large .these are problems , but have these peolpe ever thought new environment - freindly feul will lighten the pollution ?have they ever thought the road condition will improve steadly in years with the billions of dollars the government given annually ?so these problems can be solved soomthly , and further there are more exciting advantages of owning a private car .first , the private car will do bring a unmatched convenience while compared to other public traffics ( subway , commute ) .just imagine , with your own car you can go wherever you want to in holidays and vacations .what a fascinating experience you are going to enjoy !second , more that convenience , a car can provide something beyond physical .for instance , if you are successful man in society and you are driving your fancy car in road , you will be admired by others because of your nice car .according to psychologist being admired is vital to a person , because it can help you to get confidence in society .so based on these reasons , the car number wo nt decrease in decades .last it is safe when you use the private car than public traffic , you wo nt be stolen or robbed in your own car .if we can bear the crowdness in buses and subways , if we have enough time to waste in buses before they get to offices or schools , if we will never be robbed in midnight subways , we agree the private cars will decrease because we can use public traffic instead of private cars .but we ca nt , so cars wo nt decrease in years .
