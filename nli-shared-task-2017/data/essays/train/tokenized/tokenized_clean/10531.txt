i do not agree with this statement even fi i would like this forcasting was true .in the next years our cities will be crowded with much more cars that today .firs of all people really need their cars in everything they do especially if they work far form their homes .public trasportations are not good enough to make people change their habits .they are always late and dirty , this is because the state does not invest enough in improving public services .if it takes 30 minutes to go from home to my office by car and it takes 50 minutes by train because it is always late i will never change my routines and i will always keep using my car every morning .secondly the increasing number of cars in use is also due to the widespread wealth that there is in our cities .for instance in italian families there is a mean of 3 cars every 2 persons .many people buy cars not because they need them but because they have a lot of money to spend and so they buy stuff they do not really need .since in many cities the wealth is increasing if think that in 20 years we will have much more cars than today in our cities .this will be a huge problem for the environmental stanpoint , i think that there are two possible solution , the first one is an agressive solution while the second one is a proactive solution aimed at making people collaborate .a first potential solution is to forbid the use of cars in downtown during working days so that people would be forced to use public trasportation .a second potential solution could be about investing some money , raised with taxes , in improving the efficiency of public trasportations .i think that in this way poeple would decide voluntarly to use subways and trains instead of their own cars .instead i think that there is no solution concerning the habits of buying too many cars compared with needs .in conclusion i think that even if some actions will be undetaken to reduce the number of cars in use , the results will be anyway an increase cars in the next years .
