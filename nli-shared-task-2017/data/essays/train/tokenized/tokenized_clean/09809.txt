advertisments are a good way to sell products .in fact , they can make products look much better than they realy are .therefore , they can make them look in different size and more beutiful .first , tricking customers eyes is a realy good way to get more money .first , you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it in the desired look poeple want .for example , i remember a tv show that was unnouncing to win a sport car if anyone ansewrs the quistion showed on the screen .however , the quistion was so easy that i was going to call them .i saw alot of people calling them ; in fact , the tv show got alot of money from the people calling it .a person won the sport car , finally , and he was so happy .however , the funny thing is that the car was a really small car .actually , it was a kid car toy .therefore , they showed the car , and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine , but that tricked everbody even me .i think that this a smart way for marketting products .second , advertisments makes the producets looks more nice and beutifull .in fact , they are using proffisional and careful workers who can handle the product without making any mistake that let the people notice any disadavtage of it .for instant , i saw a knife advertisment .the knife seemd so sharp .that was just because of the careful workers .however , when i tried the knife in my home i broke it .in brief , advertisments makes changes the product size and making it more useful .i think that it is not a crime because companies do not say any lie or show any different product .they are just giving adantages of their product ignoring disadvantages .
