the youth of this generation , who have been able to create a place of their own , who have been able to mark a positon in the society are the young people of today s world .they are able to make up to this position through a hard toiled path which includes their own efforts as well as their parents and elders views and difficult sacrifices made by them .many such succesful people unlike a few are very much known about the facts leading to their success .so i strongly disagree to the statement .youth these days are definately giving enough time to help their communities .they thank and are grateful to all those people who have helped them taste the sweet fruit of success .i have seen and have encountered many such great acheievers who not only devote themselves entirely to their own work , but also squeeze out enough of time for helping others in their times of needs and thus solve their problems .for instance the alva brothers , who own a production company of their own .they produce and direct environment awakening programmes that are in the benefit of nature .along with this they very inquisitely take part in the functions and programmes related to nature to bring about an awarness they are helping out people who need them , they manier times take up many honourary works to support them .thus they are doing a lot to support their community who have helped them to come up .such successful people , once they have achieved success and reached the peak , always strive for others , especially their own family members and relatives as well to reach a higher postion as them .but this happens only if the others show an interest or are willing to do something great .such people work 24/7 nonstop manier times .an instance for this are many doctors and physicians .their parents sacrifice a lot , so that their sons/daughters can mark a place , and after getting success , these doctors devote themselves entirely to the wanting people , the diseased people who are in need of them .mother teressa in her youth days is also a great example to be looked upon .she devoted her life from her youth till her last breath to the cause of humanity and supporteding her community .
