i agree with this statement .i believe that by understanding ideas and mostly concepts is mainly the foundation to create new facts .understanding ideas makes a person more focused in the subject to discuss .it brings new thoughts in mind , and it points the correct direction or way that its intended .also i believe , that it allows the student to elaborate on its own and it leaves an open field for new ideas .on the other hand , understanding concept is fundemental for the structuring of a future fact .if you , for starters , do not know the concept of things , you lose complete orientation towards things .in order to solve a problem , is it imperative to know the concept of it and what you are really talking about .for example , if a student is asked to elaborate an essay on the president of the united states , it would be more appropiate to the student to understand the political idea of having a president , and of course the concept of it .if the student only knew for fact who it is and what does he do , he or she could not have a reasonal judgement on the matter nor could have a responsible decision in future political campaigns .l support school systems that involves creative thinking and encourage a student to make decision on their own by understanding and creating own ideas .if we were forcing to learn the simple facts of everything , we woul nt be able to make a true opinion for things and could nt be able to give to new generations ideas that will help them grow and develop even better than previously .finally , i will like to finish my essay with a personal thought .not everything is for fact , there s many things in life that does nt have an explanation for it , but if you understand the idea of it , you might as well live by it .
