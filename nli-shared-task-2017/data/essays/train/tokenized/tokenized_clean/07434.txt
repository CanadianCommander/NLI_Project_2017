i disagree with the idea that in about 20 years time frame there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .the reasons for my disagreement follow .firstly , the populations , as always , is on a high rise and will continue to do so .hence , there will be more people travelling on the same and limited space on earth .further , the birth rate and life expectancy of the people has been increasing , with the help of medical advancements that are made everyday , and hence , there will be more number of people who will be in a position to either drive the car by themselves or at least travel in the cars .hence , there will be a definite need of more cars as there will be more people for using the cars .secondly , advancements in the machinery of the cars and various parts of the cars are being made every passing day .such advencements are also directed towards cutting down the cost of the cars .if the cost of the cars is reduced to great levels , more people will be able to afford a seperate car for themselves .thirdly , the world is growing global with every passing day and each member in most of the families has seperate goals and different daily routine .in order to achieve their goals and lead their different daily routines , each member in the family may need a seperate car .hence , the idea that the number of cars will be reducing in future is not a realistic one .although , i agree that with the increment in the number of cars , more fuel will be needed and we have limited source of energy and resources of fuel .but with the researchers making continuous efforts for creating and finding new sources of energy , it is not far that we will stop using conventional sources of energy and will have newer sources of energy .for example , it is not far that we will be able to utilize the solar energy for driving our cars , in fact , many of the cars that run on solar power are already in the market .for all the reasons listed above , i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use after 20 years that there are today .
