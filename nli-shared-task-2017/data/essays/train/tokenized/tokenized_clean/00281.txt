well , i disagree with the statement that says `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .the reason for that , is i think facts are the basic of ideas .so , how can an idae or a concept come before the fact .consquantally , the we leran the basic which is the fact , then we propose an idea .so , if a students recivied an idea or a concept without having the solid basics , he wil not be able to make his decision about it .therefor , he will not have the apportinuty to discouss the concept .clearly , the logical way to learn is facts then concepts .so , we teach students the basics and the facts , and gradually try to involve some ideas and concepts into their material .in this way , they will learn how accepet all the opinions and then make their own decision .also , they will try to interfere from the facts then try to propose their explaination and support it with evidences .an example for my choise if geology calss .if we taught a student that caves are formed in a certain way , he will memorize it without conventition .in other hand if we taught him about caves from different areas .they are an extent area but if he got some information about kinds of caves and how it formed , he will be convinted about what he learns .
