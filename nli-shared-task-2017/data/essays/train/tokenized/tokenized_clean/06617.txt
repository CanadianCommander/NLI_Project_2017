who enjoys life more young poeple or old ones .it is very important for us to enjoy our time in our life span owing to the fact that we fell positive and happy if we only enjoy our time .people often claim that young people enjoy life more than old people however i am inclined to belive that , old people can enjoy just as the same levvel or more/i have many reasons to belive so .to start with according to me young people spend good time which is true they do not have many responsibelties , they can make many sports , ride their bike and the like but they are also in the term of their like they have being educated .i thing that this is a very hard time of ones life they have to obbey to rule , to be dissipline which can be gloomy and sad .in this term of their life they do not have the apportunety to chose what they want .they are in control of their parents or their theachers .according to me , adults have the ability to chose what they want to do whicw is the most significant issue according to me .fredom is something which we enjoy in life naturely and instinctly .aspecialy if we choose a job that we tend to or have talend on i can not see any reasons which can take an adult to be unhappy /taking everything in to accoud , i strongly belive that adults can also enjoy their life just as young ones do or much more by chooseng the right job and controlling their selves .working , earing money and spending it on something they enjoy .
