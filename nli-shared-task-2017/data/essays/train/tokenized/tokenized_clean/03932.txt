i agree with the statement in which it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .there is several reasons why i think so .first , if you have broad knowleadge of many kinds of academic subjects , you can communicate with many kinds of people .in other words , you can talk with a person who are studying international politics and economics and laws if you have any knowledge .in opposite side , if you have only knowledge of laws , you ca nt talk with a person learning about economics .second , by gaining widespread knowledge , you can be interested in various subjects .i think that s so nice .if you have interest in various subjects , then you will have more ways you can choose in your life than a person who has interest in only one thing .finally , we should get as much knowleadge as possible while we are living .i think knowing is growing , so we can grow until die .
