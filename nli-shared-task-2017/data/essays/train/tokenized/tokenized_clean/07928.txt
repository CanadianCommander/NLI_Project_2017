` young people enjoy life more than older people doto answer this question i would like to first illustrate what is enjoyment ?everybody has different modes and ways to enjoy life .or when can a person enjoy ?to enjoy everymoment in life one has to be without tension and be confident about yourself .now if we compare between young and old people in terms of the points given above .first one is `` tension  ?normally old people have lot of tensions like marriage of his daugther which is very common in indian society , then they have tensions about their life after retirement ; whether children will take care or no etc . .now if we compare the same thing in the life of young people then we see that their tensions are not so severe , they do have tensions about career and other minor problems and even if the problems are severe they have the energy and confidence that they have more time to handle but old people have time constraint .it is true that young also has time constraint but it is not prevalent since people believe to die old not young .it may be true that one can enjoy life being at home but one may get bored being at one place .young people have lot of options for enjoyment since they have lot of energy and enthusiasm to be adventrous so they can go anywhere like trekking , swimming , moving around in the town , flirtting etc . ..but old ones have less choice since their age and energy level acts as a major obstracle .even if they want to go somewhere they will not be allowed to go alone since they will be stopped by their children , daughter-in-law etc. and they need to have somebody with them and it may not be very practical since young people dont like going out with old people .i enjoy every moment of my life but when compared to my father and mother they do not since they are burdened with lot of tensions .thus i truly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
