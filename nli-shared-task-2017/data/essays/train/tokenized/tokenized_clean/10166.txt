i agree with the following statement .it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , rather concentrating on facts .facts are a deriavative of ideas and concepts .you learn science through theoritical and practical approach , either of these alone can not do the job .take physics , you learn numerous formulas , understand the concept and ideas behind it , then only you can put it into practical use for society .when you apply a certain formula or method you get facts and figures which you can tabulate and store for further use and bring out new results .for proper application of a theory or hypothesis a student should be clear of the concepts and ideas then only he will be able to think creatively , logically , practically and may end up adding new dimension to it or even challenge a fact .a better understanding or concept and ideas will lead to greater understanding of the subject .concepts and ideas are the foundation stone of science , whether it be quantum physics or cell division .science is everywhere and every activity is related to it , from gardening to rocket science so it should be based on concepts so that student development is such that at an advanced stage he is able to relate things , apply his/her scientific knowledge and do other productive things .facts are also necessry but only after concepts and ideas .facts are the contraints present .knowing or unknowing a fact will not effect the end result , but will effect the process .facts are secondary they should be emphasised on only after knowing the caocepts and ideas right .for better learning environment , competetiveness , application and for the cause of science concepts and ideas are to be induced in the students .this can be done only with mutual coordination between students and teaching community for a
