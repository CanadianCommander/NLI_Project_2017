ideas are caused by thinking intensely or doing indepth research about any particular subject .understanding the concept will make the person researching that particular subject a versatile in that particular subject .a fact may leave the student only with the outer layer of an indepth knowledge related to that subject rather than understanding `` what lies beneath  .during my tenure as a trainer with a particular organization i trained a lot of students to become effective workers .and this experience makes me suggest that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than knowing facts .when i trained employees regarding a product i.e aquring transportation permits for various trucks and tractors , i always had to talk about indepth details , about `` concepts  .otherwise the person will not be able to decipher from the request as to what kind of permit he/she has to order for .the concept of what decides a requiremnt should be understood rather than just knowing the requirement .for example , a customer requests for a permit for a particular type of vehicle to travel interstate ( that it is not licensed for ) , which usually is provided by the company and if the vehicle is used by a red cross organization which does not necessarily have to acquire as per the law .now theoritically the agent taking the request should provide the permit .now this is where concept and ideas play a vital role .if the agent did not pay attention to these concepts during training he/she will probably end up issuing a permit which is not required .another simple example : if a student knows a fact that the light bulb functions with just a press of a switch , he knows pretty much what he is supposed to know .but , when faced a challenge with the light bulb not functioning if he does not know what different components of that tubelight emit light and what other products make it work , he probably will not be able to make it work .instead , he would be wasting time waiting for a technician to attend to it .an equally interesting example is mathematics .if students do not understand the ideas and concepts of formulas and how to work with them to find a solution for a particular problem then knowing just the fact which is just a formula would not help them solve differnbt problems of the same nature .therefore , i conclude by saying that students should definitely pay more attention to understanding ideas and concepts more than just learning facts .not just students at school but students in all walks of life .
