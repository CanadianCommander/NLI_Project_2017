i do nt agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of the following reasons .this statement depends on what you think is young and old .first , all people have different point of a view .usually , young people are focused on activities , and they think that s important for them .by the way , most older people like to be calm all the time , and they enjoy their time with their family or their life partner .second , older people have more money than young people .many older people worked hard to make money , and after they retired , what they can do is spending money for themselves .frankly , money does an important role in people s lives .however , young people got to work hard to make money , and even if they have the money , they have no time to spend the money .third , older people do nt have worry about their family too much .most older people live without their children .they only need to care about their husband or wife .but , young people need to take care of their children a lot if they have .they easily can get stressed out from raising children .fourth , older people think about everything calmly .they have lived longer than young people , so they can understand things easily .they do nt act too fast or too aggressive .their lives have not many things to change .by the way , many young people are busy , that makes them to think aggressively and furiously .they do nt think about their behaviours .if someone does bad thing to them , they would get angry and they do nt think about what made other person to do bad thing to them .i strongly think that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
