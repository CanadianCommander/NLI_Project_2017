i disagree with the statement and i believe that people should specialize in one specific area of study .i will give some reasons below .firstly , because the trend of study is transfering from generalists to specialists .certainly , there are historical figures who achieved a lot in different subjects , but these figures rarely exisit these days .and as the resarch on each subecuts has accumulated through centuries , now it is impossible to cope with the whole subjects .these days , we are rather required to focus on one field .from my experience in the university s master course and in the government , i i believe that this trend is common in academic and proffesional field .secondly , because we have so many information thanks to the develpoment of technology ; especially internet , and it is hard to catch up with a new trend in one subject already .thus , even if one try to acquire knowledge in many academic subjects , the great possbilities are that he end up understanding every subjects insufficiently .thirdly , because there is more possibility to contribute to the human beings if we specialize in certain subjects .i believe that having knowledge in different subjects can enrich your life , because it help you to understand the world more .however , from the perspective of contibuting to the human beings through your study , it is much helpful to others if you study really in depth in a certain subject and make an discovery or improvements in that field .there are plenty of example , especailly in scientific field .for example , we have doctor noguchi , who discoverd a vaccination and saved a lot of people .from these reasons , i believe that we should concentrate on only one subject and this focus can make us more successful .
