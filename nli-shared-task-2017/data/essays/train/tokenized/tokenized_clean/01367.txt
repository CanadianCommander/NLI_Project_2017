in order to be successful , do we need to try new things ?or , should we stick to what we know how to do best ?do nt we have an intirinsic cruiosity ?so , what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to chose not to do what we already know best ?could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing ?as a successful commander sir winston chirchill has a saying : `` the first of all values of man is courage  .i agree that in order to be succesful people should be brave and try new things .let us first look at to the history and pick up mr. edison .he invented the lamb after tryind 2000 different ways leading him to dissappointment .he tried `` 2000 new things  and came up with the lamb .likewise , we can consider darwin and his theory against creavitism .besides , being historically proved our intrinsic cruiosity always leads us to try new things .people always wonder about what we do not have or what we have never seen .we wonder what it feels to be popstar , or we go on a vacation to see a part of the world .since it is our nature why should we resist it .it is like to be a carnivoriuos loin !can you imagine such a lion survive or become successful .in order to be successful people should try new things .
