it s clearly known that young people play more often than older people .but does it means that babies and adolescents enjoy life more than their parents or their grand parents ?i do nt think so for my part .i do nt think that enjoying your life can only be restricted to going to parties , playing video games and taking a maximum of risk for yourself .it really that which mainly differ young people behaviors from older people behaviors .many youngs think that you enjoy life when you constantly confronte your life with danger .it s really strange , because by definition , danger can easily catches out your life .but it s what many young people choose to take conscious that they are alive .what it is essential to enjoy your life , is to have some interest points .and i think that older people often have many .they are often more prudents but it does nt prevent them from having hudge amount of things that they love to do .basically , what count is the pleasure that you are feeling when you are doing something that you like .if it s the case , you enjoy your life .if a 70 years old man gets pleasure when he stays hours and hours near a lake by waiting a fish with his fisher line , it s his fully right .a 20 years old young man could find it so boring , but maybe the old man would find boring to go to one of his techno parties .as a conclusion , when you grow the only thing that may change is the way that you evaluate danger .of course your behavior changes according to this changement in your mind .it would be a pity for every children , if they already know that they wo nt enjoy life anymore when they will be older
