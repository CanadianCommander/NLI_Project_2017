most of the people are happy with the knowledge they have or say they are unconcerned about new topics , while some other type of people , have an appetite to do new things that is try out new things .my type of category is the second one , so i would go with and agree to the statement - `` succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.  for their insatiable curiosity , always active and open , risk involved .unquenchable curiosity is the driving force behind all the successfull people .it is this force which keeps them engaged in their work .as for example , let us consider an scientist .he is a person always wanting to know how thing work , what will happen next , what would be the response if i do it that way - are some of the question arousing in minds of these mens .thomas alva edison is one of the most succesfull scientist & a men with these virtues .he experimented with around 1200 ideas , and finally invented the electric bulb .it was this appetite for inventing , rather say doing things differently from rest of the mass made him a successfull person .always active and open to ideas is an another attribute of the wise .they clasp or hug new ideas with open arms .isaac newton can be a considered to be a part of this species .everyone saw apple falling but only newton was the one to cast doubts by thinking `` why that apple fell .by taking calculated risk they take their bussiness , principles to peak or pass off as an forlorn entity .a whole lot of people get success by trying out new things differently and innovating an already active idea .some of the ingredients of these kind of people is their curiosity towards their work , their open mind and the ability to take risk .to be successful in life , a person has to be : keen towards his work , open to different views by different peoples and the ability to take some good risk . ..atleast once .
