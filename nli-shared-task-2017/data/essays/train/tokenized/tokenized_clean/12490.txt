i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are two reasons .first , young people nowadays tend to be raised to be more self-centered in capitalistic places .they are being told , either directly or indirectly , that fulfilling personal desires or achieving personal gains is more important than helping communities .in capitalistic places , people emphasize more about their personal abilities and achievements rather than their sense of devotion and caring to a larger group other than their companies .although our school systems and communities try to send out the opposite messages , individual competition and the collapse of the sense of cooperation are on the winning side .second , young people today are raised to be more spoiled .they get what they want eaiser .they are more indulged in their personal comforts and pleasures .many of them may consider helping communities a waste of time .they may think , `` what would helping communities do me any good ?that wo nt necessarily make my report cards or resumes look good .who cares about community service certicates ?besides , i will get more fun to hang around in a mall and eat ice cream with my friends !in my opinion , the most inner reason that they see no points of helping their communities is because they are not used to helping and giving , but more to receiving .nowadays , parents who raise children tend to ask less but give more and more easily .when people start to raise fewer children , they make their only or few children the queens and kings of the families .modern parents  indulgence creates more selfish and indifferent children , which is harmful to our communities and society .
