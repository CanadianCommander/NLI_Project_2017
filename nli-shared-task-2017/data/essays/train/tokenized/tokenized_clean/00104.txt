young people are usually full of life , and need that extra bit of excitement in life to make the life more meaningful and rewarding .but , seeing today s changing corporate habits , one can certainly notice that having fun and enjoying life is now more of a global attitude , whether that be somebody old or young .but , the people driving this changing mindset , are certainly the younger minds in the business .if one considers example of one of the major software companies in india and the world , infosys , one can get a clear idea of how the corporate mindset and behavious is changing with time .people , young or old , working day and night for the company are continuously looking to get a change in their life , may be by taking a break during the day to play table-tennis with one of the colleagues , or may be by organizing weekend parties at the nearby resort .this drastic change , in fact is happening across all businesses and societies .but the changing mindset is certainly coming because of the incoming of the new generation of people in these fields .the young crowd is certainly the one which like to enjoy life the most , and in fact do so .one look at any of the city s most happening clubs and parties , and we can notice the number of young people frolicking those places .this has brought a sea of change among the mindest of the whole society , and is now even entering the coporate boardrooms .but , the fact also remains that life is not just about parties and get togethers .some people also get the enjoyment of their lives by being engaged in their work .these people who have the passion for their work , and the drive to excel in the field , see their enjoyments in the work itself .this can be proved from the example of sir richard branson , who has continuously tried to develop his passion into his work and is hence reaping the rewards of the hard work done all this time .such people redefine the age related dilemma about enjoying life , as it brings into the picture more older than younger people who seem to be enjoying their life .in conclusion , i believe that enjoyment of life is not a factor of someone s age but instead a factor of the activity which defines ` enjoyment  to a particular person .but , since the change is brought forward in today s society by the young generation only , there is a majority of younger people who enjoy their life more than their older counterparts .
