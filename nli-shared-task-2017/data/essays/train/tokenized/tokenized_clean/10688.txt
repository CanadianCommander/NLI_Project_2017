traveling is an experience that is extremly related with every individual s personality , style of life , and interests .that is why people travel in very different ways and there is always a market for every type of traveler .for me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable ways of traveling since i am an adventurer and in those kinds of trips it is difficult to get so much flexibility as i like .traveling for me is one of the best ways to form our own personality and to have experiences that will shape our life for ever .when you have a tour gide , the possibilities of achieving those experiences will be drastically limited because you will always be lead by another person s point of view .visiting museums , ruins , antique buildings and all of the rich historical places for me is what makes the difference on a trip but being led by a tour guide on all of them is not the kind of experience i would like .it is important to have a guide while visiting historical places because you learn things that by yourself you would never have discovered but , the problem is when the guide is the same person in all of them like in most tour guided trips .when groups travel with one guide they recive the point of view of only one person everywhere they go .i believe that history is is closely related with facts but those facts are always related with the historian s point of view , tour guides as every person who knows about history imply their opinion on their explenations and by listening only to one person will limitate us to create our own judgement .flexibility is also very important for me when traveling .i am a kind of person who likes to decide every detail of the trip and by having a tour guide you are not able to do those kinds of desicions .also i belive that doing several things with out planing are always fun because the experience will be always different .this way we meet different people , we live things that we thought we never would and finally i could say that we are able to enjoy things that we thought were not going to happen .traveling , meeting new people , living new experiences , has made me the person i am now .i do not like to be led by someone else .i think that defending my personal opinion is the most important thing i can do .traveling with a tour guide may be the best way for traveling for many people but for me traveling is so personal that it has to be an experience compleatly of your own .
