i agree withe the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .for three reasons .the first reason why i agree is understanding ideas and concepts is more important than just learning the facts is according to my experience .when i was 10th grade i hated math that is because i am not good at math .i just memorized the facts but i did not know why the answer is .but , when i was 11th grade , my math teacher said that i have to know the ideas and concepts to do well in the math .from then , i did not memorized the facts , instead , i studied the ideas and concept .after the few month , i became to do well in math .according to my experience , i think understanding ideas and concepts is more important .second , to understand ideas and concepts we have to think long , patiently .during this process we can learn the facts automatically and we will not forget the facts .and during the process , to understand ideas and concepts , it will make us to think more flexibly .and make us more logically .and the last as we understand ideas and concepts we can understand the facts more .beacuse , understanding ideas and concepts may make us to think more flexibly and more logically , may we make us tounderstand the facts more and according to my experience i agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
