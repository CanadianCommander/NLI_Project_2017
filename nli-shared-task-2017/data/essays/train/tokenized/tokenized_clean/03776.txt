i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts - at least at university level .having studied law in both england and in france , i have had the chance to compare two very different legal systems and more importantly , two different approaches to education , especially to the teaching of law .studying law at university in england typically takes three years .after three years of undergraduate studies , students obtain their `` ll.b. degree  .it is also possible for students who have studied something else during their undergraduate studies to take a one-year-conversion course and obtain the equivalent of the ll.b. degree .the three-year period of time is relatively short compared with the study time that is required of law students on the european continent , for instance five years in belgium and spain , four years in france etc .the one-year-conversion course also seems to be a tremedously flexible alternative to the many years of studying law that are required on this side of the channel .this is a good illustration of diverging points of view on the question whether it is more important that students understand ideas and concepts or learn facts .indeed , in british universities , emphasis is put on reasoning .professors and students gather to discuss different topics , argue , give pros and cons . ..all for the sake of discussion and developing a critical sense .it is believed that students will not be able to learn all the facts and memorize all the laws and/or jurisprudence so the focus remains on understanding the reasoning and legal concepts .on the continent however , universities focus much more on teaching students something `` substantial  and to that end , students need to memorize a lot of material which serves as the basis of their reasoning .to conclude , i would say that having experienced both systems , i found the british approach more constructive .it could be compared to teaching a man how to fish instead of giving him a fish .
