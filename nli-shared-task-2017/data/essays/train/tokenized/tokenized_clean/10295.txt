i disagree with that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .many country is developping rapidly now .just like china and india .these two country were not so superior in ecnormics before , but they are developping now .there is a big population in both of the two country .as the country developped , they would be manufact a large number of cars for transport or for the citizen s use .as we all know , china is the biggest bike using country in the world .but now , more and more chinese became to buy cars instead of bikes .of course so do the people in india .people need cars when they want to go to the place not so near to them .and i do nt think the people in well-developped country , just like usa and japan , will stopping using cars .people feel inconvenient when they lost something they are used to use .espectially in usa , the usa is so wide that people live in there ca nt leave from cars .the car companies are trying to make light cars which consume less gasoline to antipolution .but none of them stops producing cars .they know cars are greatly needed by people over the world .maybe you will say that people can take the metros or buses .they are also very convneient .that is ture .and people also can take them in rush hours .but what about weekends ?when we want to go out for a picnic with our family , do you think it is better to take metro than drive the car yoursevles ?of course not !everybody need the space of himself .so a car is necessary to every family .we can take a metro to go to the workplace , but we ca nt bear do the same thing when we get along with our families or lovers .so everybody of us needs car .there wo nt be fewer cars in use than there are today i think .
