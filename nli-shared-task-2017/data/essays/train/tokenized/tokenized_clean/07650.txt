i agree with the statement thatnow the world is full of cars , and probably in the future we will have more .so i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than today .i agree with this statement for two fondamental reasons .the first is that the tecnology today is growing up very quickly , and so it is more easy to built cars faster and better than yesterday .in addiction to this fact the fabrics of cars spend less money to do them , and so they produce a huge number of them .probably in the future , by the fact that is so easy and so economic to buy a car , every people will have one .secondly i think that people really like to drive and to have car , and this is an other reason why the commerce of them will be increase in the future .today , in our society , the car represent one of the status simbol of the person who own that object .that is a very big problem becose it could generate differenses and gelosies between people .in conclusion i think that in the future people will buy more cars than today , and so in twenty years a person could have more than one car than today .
