big expectationsi agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my point of view , advertisements are the masks that products wear .with those masks on their faces , you can not understand the products  quality .because advertisements are just hiding the reality .to start with an example to illustrate the advertisements  show side , there was an advertisement of a chocolate and on the advertisements the whole school was eating it because the chocolate tasted very nice and it included more calcium in it than it included the chocolate .however , when i bought and tried it , it was awful and when i read the ingredients of the product , i saw that there is very little calsium in it .the advertisement was just a lie .the chocolate on the advertisement was wearing the mask that i mentioned before .moreover , the advertisements hide the reality in the sense that they do not allow - and can not-the consumers to try the products .behind the scene , they just appear as they would be demanded .may be if a consumer tries the product on television , he or she will find lots of bad sides of it .since it is the relationship between supply and demand , the advertisers just give what is demanded by curtailing the real ingredients of a product .all in all , according to my opinion , advertisement business is a show business .show requires lies , small tricks and big and pink expectations .advertisement shows give these tricky things in such an intelligent way to its audiences that they want to make that audience to buy and consume that product .whether the product is as it is shown or not is not their primary concern .so most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are just to attract people and make them buy that products .
