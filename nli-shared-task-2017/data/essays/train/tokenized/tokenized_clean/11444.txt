yes it is true that successful people bound themselves in such a way that they are always inclined t do new thing and do traditional things in innovative ways rather than adopting the same old methods .i had been working with a lawyer who is very ambitious and at such an age i.e. 60 yrs. he is so energetic and filled with ideas that rare can challenge .there had been various examples in indian history where people employed new techniques and tok risk and succeeded .one of such example is sunil bharti mittal ( airtel ) in the initial days when he was struggling , an idea of key pad phone clicked him , at that time india was not used to key pad telephone instruments .there were boring round mechanical instruments with out any features except to connect people .then there came the era of key pad phones and it was a revolution for india , many faclities were provided in those instruments .though it was a hit and trial effort but it worked and it was the risk that this person took and made life comfortable .then the era of mobile phones came and now lots of players have come into operations and competing with each other .there is another success story of maruti car .initially in india , i.e. after independence the car available in india was ambassador of fiat no other car was available in india except for the imported ones and that can be afforded by people with big pockets only .this problem was solved by mr. sanjay gandhi who is the key person fr entry of japanese cars into india .maruti in collaboration wth suzuki was ntroduced in the year 1984 and people welcomed it with great respect .though it was a risk taken by that person , it worked and today it has superseded all other cars available in india .this is how success stories begin and continues .they say sucess is a journey and not a destination .
