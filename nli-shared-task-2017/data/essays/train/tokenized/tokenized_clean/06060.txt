yes .i think so it is not fine that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in on specific subject .because people having different ideas of their subject .some people go for different subject like social and some people go for science .it depends apon how they study .some people having broad knowledge of their academy subject .and other dont .their should be information abot the academic what is the matter and what it matters .it all depends upon them .i prefer to go with broad knowledge of many academic subjects .because iy helps us to have more knowledge about the subject and we can easily understand the subject .broad knowledge helps us to discuss and share our opinion about a particular subject which mainly we choose .it is easy to specify the subject with a broad knowlede helps to get good scores in particular subject .so broad knowledge specialize and specify the subject easily .so gaining extra knowledge of subject is good .we know about the topic correctly and perfectly they we can futher proceed to next subjects .this is what advantage to us that we have many information about the subject and how it helps us in studting .ex ; a person who has a little knowledge of subject gets less marks .where as the other student have a good or broad knowledge about the subject will get more mareks because it is better for the student to have broad thinking .so this is only why the broad helps us to allow us to collect more information u can knowledge helps us ti have broad knowledge of many subjects .it ok to choose a subject .i prefer it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject than one specific subject .
