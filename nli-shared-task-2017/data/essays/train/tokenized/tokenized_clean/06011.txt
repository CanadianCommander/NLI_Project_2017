this statement seems to be true at a first glance .but having a closer look on this topic one should differentiate more precisely .first of all these type of statements can not be generalized .thus it should at least be mentioned that we can only speek of majorities .second one should be aware that an answer to the question whether or not young people enjoy life more than elder is highly subjective .from my experiance i would even oppose .admittedly younger people in most cases bring along a higher level of physical fitness .thus they have a broader variety of entertainment opportunities .in turn this opportuny might raise the confidence of young people .but what really matters is time ( actually my opinion ) .as i define young people to be something around 20 and older people to be retired , i think elder have signifacantly more time than young people have .this degree of freedom ( in the sense of time ) allows for much more activities .while for instance students have to learn and work hard to fund their studies retired persons might meet with friends , travel around , go out and drinks some , visit operas , go shopping or whatoever .this lack of time is a crutial thing that counts against a superior fun-level of young people .secontly i think young people are exposed to more stress .old people do not have to make decisions like `` should i join this or that university ?  or `` should i apply for this internship ( respectively job ) ?.this type of decisions - someone in the beginning twenties have to make - cause an inherent stress situation , which again lowers life quality .thus i conclude from my personal experiance that this relationsship does not hold .i think it is actually the other way round .again , one should not neglect that this answer is highly subject to the definition of young and old and must not be true for each individual .
