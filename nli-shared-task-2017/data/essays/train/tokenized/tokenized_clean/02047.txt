does young people enjoy life more than the older people do ?the answer to this question , in my opinion , is `` no  .the following three reasons supports my opinion .everyone in this world enjoys life the way he wants to depending on the available resources .the young people are working full-time and have much more money in hand as compared to that of older people , who are living on old age pensions or working part-time for the little amount of money .moreover , as they are old they usually do not have good health and lots of their money is spent in hospital and medicine bills .therefore , old people have less enjoyment resources as compared to the young people .we could find almost all younger people going to resturaunts , clubs and on holidays frequently and think that they are enjoying life .on the other hand , older people might have also done the same when they were young and might not want to do same at this stage of life .they might want to travel to a peaceful place like temple or church and spend some time there in peace , which they think they enjoys the most .the second and most important point is the physical strength .the older people have very less physical strength as compared to the energetic younger population .therefore , the older people want to stay at home and enjoy life with their family , which does not mean that they are not enjoying life but their means of enjoyment is different from that of the younger generation .the younger generation actuall shows to their peers and others that this is the stage in their life and they should enjoy the most now and tend to show their peers that they are enjoying much more than them and we usually get the perception that young people are enjoying more than the older people .for example if a twenty year old guy goes to the best and most expensive disco in town , he will be telling this to all of his friends to show his superiorness to his friends .therefore the difference is not who enjoys the life more , young or old people , but the difference is how both young and old people enjoy life .their preferences and means of enjoyment are different but both enjoy life equally .
