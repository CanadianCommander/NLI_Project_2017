the main purpose of advertisements is to attract potential customers .hence they are made in a way that makes the product seem much better than the product actually is .advertisements use different ways to make the product very attractive .they tend to deceive us in some ways .they also usually highlight only those features that are very appealing to people .advertisements are made to market a product and increase its sales .the main aim of advertisement is to make the product look very suitable to its potential buyers .for this , the product must look really attractive .sometimes , to achieve this fake objects are used .for example , the bright red strawberry pieces in the advertisement of a cereal may not actually be the real strawberry .it may be just brightly painted plastic pieces .when the advertisement looks very appealing , people get interested in it .no one would want to buy something that looks dull , uninteresting .children are specially influenced by the advertisements .in the advertisements , the toys appear so real and much better than they actually are .for example , the spiderman toy seems to jump , fly and save the planet from the bad people .in reality , it is the child actor who is holding the toy , who is making it do wonderful things .but to the child who is watching the advertisement , it seems as if the toy is doing things on its own .so advertisements do deceive us in some way which we fail to recognise when we are watching them .advertisements usually focus on only those features that are very appealing .for example , when you see an advertisement on phone services , you will see a list of features like high quality service , great rates , etc. in bold letters .what you may miss out is , something in small letters that says , `` conditions may apply  .advertisements tend not to highlight hidden costs or factors that may scare away the potential customer .advertisements are made to sell the product and for that they do make the product seem much better than what it actually is .
