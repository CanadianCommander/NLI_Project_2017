in a modern society , people always face the dilemma to believe whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not .the problem is the much debated one in that it affects everybody in their daily lives .people may prefer one to another , some may have no ideas about it at all .before rendering my opinion , i think it is necessary to take a glance at the arguments of both sides .it is quite easy for average people to believe that most advertisements make products not seem much better than they really are .but at a mean time , althought believeing most advertisements make products not seem much better than they rally are has some advertages , it also has many drawbacks , such as they miss the real good products .therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that most advertisements make products not seem much better than they really are .what is more , the innate quality of most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , is ofter underestimated ; in other words , if you notice the invisible benefits of most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .here i would explain a few of the most important reasons .the main reason why people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that because of buying to many pool quality products , people do nt believe advertisements any more .for example , my mother saw a very good make-up in the advertisements , then she brought it as a high price .but it was nt good as it says in the advertisements .in addition , the further reason why i admir it is that the you feel some advertisements are not real , the story of the advertisements will not happen in our lives .to explain this point , there is an appropriate example that an story of a advertisements is talking about the talking between two cats to sell the cats food .but you know it will not happen .if all of the factors above are considered , we can come to the conclusion that most adbertisements make products seem much better than they really are .people can choose better products when they notice this points .
