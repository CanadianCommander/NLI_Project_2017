i do not think young people nowadays do nt dedicate enough time to helping their communities .if by `` communities  other concrete , fully fledged people like them , also presumably living in the same country , are meant , this is certainly not the case .at least , to the extent that young people fulfill their duties properly .a typical young person is , indeed , one who has a job and spends most of his time with it .well , i take this to be exactly the most effective way of helping other people in a community .by carrying out his or her work properly , as well as with all the competence required , a young person really does serve the other people at his or her best .many young people do not have a job , to be sure , as they are still studying and spend most of their time at the university .even so , i think they are of great help to their own communities .for their studies will eventually result in some skills and qualifications .these will hopefully enable them to serve the society as soon as they accomplish their duties as students .there are , of course , possible objections to such a line of thought .one could argue , for example , that a typical way of helping a community is being engaged in politics and that this is what most young people actually refuse to do .there might be some truth in this remark .but i think we may not legitimately expect people to exhibit what they did not receive .as long as politics is so confused and discouraging , it is not fair to expect from young people a sort of interest they could not get from their models in society .let s take a different example .helping a comminity is often thought of as going to hospitals and vising ill people .these are very good deeds , of course .but , coming back to the point i made above , these are also things that can better be done by quilified guys who have been especially trained for this purpose .summing up , if we assume that young people are generally good guys and that they do what they are supposed to do , i do nt think they are selfish or do not spend time for the sake of those communities where they live .
