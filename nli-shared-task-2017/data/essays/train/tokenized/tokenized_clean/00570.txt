when i see the commercials on television , i see many goods which look so facinating and useful .however , are they really useful like the commercial s explanation ?i do not think so , since i believe that the advertisement is a way to lure the cumstomers to buy and to maximize the profit .thus , sellers will only show the beneficial and useful sides of the commodities .thus , i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem more useful than they really are .first , the nature of advertisement is not to show people how bad the products are , but to convince them that these products are so beneficial to people s lives that they should buy .as a result , people who make the commercial have to make products seem much better than the reality .for example , my friend once bought a physical training machine which was advertised for its quick results .they said that it will decrease people s weight by ten pounds in a week if they work out an hour with it .however , when my friends tried it out , it did not show such results even when she exercised with it for many hours .another reason for most advertisements to show only good parts of the product is that if the advertisement shows the reality of the products , customers are not going to buy it , and producers will not be able to make a profit .to be specific , tyrenol , which is a famous medicine for cold and fever , is also infamous for its side effects .i once heard that it can increase the possibility of getting cancers .if the advertisement for tyrenol say ` this medicine can cause cancers ,  who will risk the chance of getting more serious disease to cure cold ?i believe that humans are easily convinced by what is good , but more easily drawn away by what is bad for them .therefore , if producers make a advertisement which shows every facet of the products , including the bad ones , people are not going to buy the products since they mostly see the demerit they will have on them rather than the good effects .producers know well about such a nature of humans ; thus , they will make advertisements which make their products look better than the reality so they could sell more .
