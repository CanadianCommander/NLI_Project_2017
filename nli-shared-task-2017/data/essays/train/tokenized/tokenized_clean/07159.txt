i strongly agree to this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are two reasons why i believe that the statement is correct .young people nowadays do not have much free time and do not have time to think about their surroundings , and they also tend to be extremely lazy and are not willing to help for their communities .these days it seems to be that young people have a very tight schedule .most teenagers have school till the evening , and some may even have extra curricular activities or part time jobs to earn some pocket money .unlike before , young people are very independent and uses time wisely which would benefit them in any possible ways .since they have a tight schedule and do not have other spare times other than thinking about themselves , they do not give enough time to helping their communities .in addition to their tight schedules , young people nowadays are extremely lazy .this may be because of the fast developing techonologies , such as use of computers , and easy access of transportations to places .teenagers are especially lazy when it comes to solving problems .they believe that they have better things to do than helping their communities , and avoid volunteer works .however , problems may change once money comes into an issue .young people nowadays love money , and they would most likely do anything which involves earning money .if the government makes this community help as some sort of a part time job , young people may find some interests in helping .today , young people are much more independent than they were before , and are extremely self centered .i believe that this problem should deffinately change as soon as possible .in this way , young people would learn that helping others is an important aspect in their lives .
