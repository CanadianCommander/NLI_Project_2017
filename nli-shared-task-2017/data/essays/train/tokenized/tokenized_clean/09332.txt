we live in an era where money is the most important thing for many people .the sellers of the products and the industries do nt care about the quality of the products , they only want to make a lot of money fast .a good way to make a lot of money fast are good advertisements .they show pics of products or say things about the product that are not real .but often this advertisements make seem products much better than they really are .a lot of food industries show pics of products that are complitely different from the real products .mcdonalds for example shows on their advertisements not the products how they really are .you can see on their advertisements very big hamburgers with fresh bread and lot of ketchup .but in real they are different , they are not so big and the bread is not so fresh .on the pictures they are showing other hamburgers that you become in the fast food .it s only a fake .an other example are the cigarettes advertisements .for example the marlboro advertisements .you can see a sane , handsome cowboy on a horse .it seems that marlboro cigarettes are a good thing , but in reality they are leading to a lot of diseas .if think it should be a regolamentation about the advertisements .that you can not say things about your product that do nt correspond to the reality , and that you can not show pictures that make appear the product better than it is .if somebody shows fake pictures of the products they should pay a fee .i think the industries should better concentrate on the quality of the products .they should better use the money for increase the quality of the food and to make food that is better for our health .
