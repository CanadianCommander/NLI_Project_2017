i do nt agree with this statement if it is refered to car as a veichle used to go to work or during the summer holiday .today the car is the most important veichle adopted by the men to move between the cities .the global population is growing and for this the car use should growth in twenty years .well , i agree to this statment if it is refered to use the cars during the motions between nations .the big distance between che nation s capital is very problem .
