some people think say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide with a strick schedule .while this might be true in some circumstances , it is better to travel with a few close friends without a strict schedule .traveling with a few close friends without a specific schedule or route allows people to truely experince a place with a constant sense of excitement and exploration .when traveling with a large group with a tour guide .the tour guide usually lay out a planned route and informs poeple where the next stop is .this takes the fun of exploration out of traveling .traveling is about seeing new things and explore a place without a person spoon-feeding you of the information about the place .different people want to visit different places , because of repective tastes .artists might typically visit a museum of natural science , while an archeologist might not be interested in visiting a modern art exhibition .however , in a large group with a tour guide , there is no freedom to explore a place and skip tourist sites by one s own will .everyone will see what everyone else sees .there is no skipping or revisiting of any particular sites .such trips will rarely satisfy any members of the traveling group completely .however , traveling with a tour guide might prove to be convenient sometimes .in a foreign country , where the people speak a different language from yours , having a tour guide can save you valuable time and energy asking for directions or prices of items .the tour guide will help you bypass the frustration of language barrier , since he/she knows the language .conversely , hiring a tour guide cost much money .without a tour guide , you can travel with more money to spend on hotel and food during the trip .traveling in a large group and tour guide can help you safe time and much frustration in a foreign country , which does not use your native language .however , having a tour guide is expensive , and traveling in a large group ruins the fun of exploring a new place with complete freedom .if the travelers in a trip are rushed like cattles , grazing past many sites superficially without satisfying anyone s need in the group , then the trip is not a fulfilling one .therefore , such trips should be avoided ( or experienced by just reading internet articles ) .
