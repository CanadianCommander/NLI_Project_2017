some people might think that it is more important for students to learn facts , while others think understanding ideas and concepts are more important .in my opinion , however , knowing ideas and concepts are much valueable than just learning facts .i agree with the statement for two reasons , if understood ideas and concepts , the student could use the theorys in other aspects when studying various happenings not only in their academic studies , but also in ordinary lives .and the students might think more logically .firstly , understanding ideas and concepts will help the students about the related factors .they can use the theorys they have learned in many areas .for example , science knowledge can be happened in our real life .in the kitchens , in the garage , in the play ground , and so on .if the student have understood about some various theorys they can understand the happenings that they have seen .like newtons theory ; the objects usually fall to the ground , easy scientif knowledge like , if ice melts it gets into liquid . ..etc .and they can deal with it when emergency situation , too .secondly , just learning facts would interrupt students when thinking logically .students those who get used to memorizing facts will have a hard time when they have to solve logical problems .for instance , especially to those who are in language major students are mostly get used to memorizing .i heard that professor in chinese language course warning to the students practice thinking logically , unless they will have hard time when they go into some companies .to sum up , it is essential for students to get the ideas and concepts than just memorizing and learning facts .so that the students can get knowledge which can be related to our ordinary life , and could think rationally .that is why i agree with the statement .
