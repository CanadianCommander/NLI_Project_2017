i agree with the statement about traveling with the tourguide with a group is the best way .because of the following reasons .you can learn lots of information about the famous places .i t s cheap , you wo nt be lonely during the travel .and you wo nt have problem talking to the foreigners .these are the following reasons and examples to the question .the first reason is that by traveling with a tour guide , you can learn many new information about the famous places you are traveling .the tour guide can expain all the important things and history about the place and help you understand more easily .second reason is that it is cheaper when you are traveling in a group rather than yourself .you can save a lot of money and if you are a student this can be the advantage to save money .money is really valuable , that is why everybody is saving them .i once visited italy with school friends when i was young , we saved alot of money .third reason is that you wo nt be loney during the journey .when i was traveling around italy with my friends i saw some people traveling alone and i thought that they looked really loney .when you are with the group you can chat and discuss how you feel about what you see and stuff .and also you can make good relationship with the members of the group .you can talk to friends you have never talked with .i made alot of friends while i was traveling and i m still in contact with one too .finally , sometimes when you are traveling alone , you can face problems talking with the residents that live on that country or any other foeigners .at this point a tour guide is very useful .he can translate and talk to them at your point of view .you can be confident with no frustration .for the conclusion i think traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better because you can gain many thing .information , save money , make new friends and be confident .
