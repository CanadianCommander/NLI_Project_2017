i think to be succecssful you do nt need to do different things but to do things differently .success :what is success and what the essential ingredients which makes a situation or a person successful ?in simple terms , success is acheiving goals with maximing efficiency .to set goal for himself and envision the future is what successful man do differently .in life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of thoses decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally .how much a person is ready to take risk will determine how commited he is to his goals .coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endevour .i want to give example of mr. dhirubhai ambani who established reliance empire in less than a life-time .he started his career in a gas station as fuelman in some distant middle eastern country .he decided to quit his job there come back to india and use stock excahnge to new heights .he has to his credit making stock market familar to common man .stock market did exist before his advent but common man was quite aloof from it .he gained most of his financial strength from people s money .he also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business .he was most political savvy businessman of his time which others never though of using .things were existing before him entering the business sphere but he gave a real meaning to them and shown the world how to use things .this example makes it amply clear that it is how you do a thing that matter and not what you do .
