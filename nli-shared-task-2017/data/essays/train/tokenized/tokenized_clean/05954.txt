with the rapid development of society and technology , the cars we use today migh have something different in the future .i strongly agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today twenty years later in consideration of economic , earth-friendly , and technological factors .first , the great number of cars and the shortage of oil trouble many industrial countries in the world .generally speaking , cars are proved to be the worst efficient transportation .it is because that we usually drive alone but a car can take at least four people at a time .the space is not used is a waste of time and money .people will rethink about the necessarity of driving cars , especially when the price of the oil is so expensive .driving cars is not an economic choice at all today .the second reason why i think cars will be replaced soon is that cars bring out too many disadvantages to both human and the earth .even though that sometimes people think that it is very convenient to drive a car , it cause more pollution than we expect , such as noise and air pollution .many studies show that the air pollution caused by cars have negative impacts on the fertility of animals .not mention that the noise pollution causes health problems .therefore , i think the natural resource on earth , the most precious treasure shared by all human and animals , should be protected by using less cars .lastly , technologies will change the way of life when it comes to the desperate needs of customers .many scientists and businessmen today are looking forward to having some new mass transit system or inventions to replace the cars .take the internet for example , people can take online course and do online shopping without driving out .hence , maybe twenty years later , we do not need cars to go to another place .instead , we can do all the things by the aids of technologies in communication and transportation .in summary , i believe that the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years for cars consume too much oil , cars cause a series of pollution , and more cutting-age mass transit system will be provided .as a result , i think that the decreasing of cars will be just around the corner .
