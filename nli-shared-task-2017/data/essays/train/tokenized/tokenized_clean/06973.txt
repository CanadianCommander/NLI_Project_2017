i m agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .because i think that older people have good memories as many as bad memories .maybe they had enjoyed life in young times too .i think that the older they become , the more complex their life become .it is dufficult for older people to enjoy life .they do nt enjoy rehter feel happiness that they have now , and remember their good memories .so young people have destiny to will have experience bad things more than now .they should enjoy their young life .
