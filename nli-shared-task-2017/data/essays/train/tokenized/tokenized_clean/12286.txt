the way of doing academic researches is always developing and dividing into new branches throughout many years .as scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast , things to be researched are getting more complex and hard .due to this , academic subjects are increasing and their context are complicated .in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons .first of all , by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new things in science .when you are interested in a specified topic deeply , it is possible to consider the details carefully .for instance , human genome project is divided into several groups and every scientific group researches a detailed part of the project .by doing this , they can rapidly get results and combine them .secondly , working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination .research groups have the opportunity to study properly and organized .if one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , he can not afford to concern with all problems and fails .consequently , specializing in one subject for academic researches is important to the development of science and technological innovation .as we share the problems , we will be succesful quickly .
