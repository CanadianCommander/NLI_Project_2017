someone thinks that a concentrated knowlege is better than a broad knowlege of various fields .however , it is so arguable issue because both cases have advantages and disadvantages .however , i strongly believe that people should have a specialized subject for the following reasons .fist of all , we should have a special skill or knowledge for getting a job .when i was an high school student , my uncle lived in my home .he was a gentlmen for my life .however , he could not get a job because he had no specific skills and knowledges .when he was an university student , his overrall grade was almost b - .he told me that people should have a specific knowledge in intereting field .he regreted his university life .however , he had broad knowlege of many academic subject such as physics , chemistry , art , music , and so on .at that time , i feel that i want to get a special skill or knowlege for my success .secondly , all subjects are becoming more deeply .one hundred years ago , we do not know the special relativity .at the time , few physicists understood the speical relativity .however , i am a high school student in korea .i learned the special relativity in physics class .i heard that one or two thousand paper are published in a day in physics .espeically , all sciences are rapidly and deeply developed day by day .therefore , we should concentrate one or two subjects for researching .another example is that we can not learn everything .although people should have a broad knowlege of many academic field , it is less than one percent of whole knowledge in the universe .in the view point , it is better to specialize in one subject than to learn various knowledge of many academic fields .in conclusion .i strongly assert that people should concentrate on a special subject .first , we need a special skill or knowldege for a gob .second many fields of academic subject are becoming deeply .to overcome this situation , we should study a special subject becasue recent knowledge should be a old one .
