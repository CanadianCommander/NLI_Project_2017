i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .although traveling in a group with a guide does have advantages for people who are not used to traveling , i think traveling by individuals is far more interesting and challenging .here below are the reasons .first of all , if you travel with a group , it is likely that the travel agency offers you only several choices of hotels .whereas if you book on your own , you can chose from a vast list of hotels that most suits your taste .you would probably have to dine in large restaurants mosty for tourists because local food establishment where they have delicious food tend to lack space to host a group .another inconvenient factor of traveling with a guide is that you can not chose the sites you would like to visit .usually , the guide would take you to the most popular tourist sites , and not to the less famous but fascinating places .you would also have limited time to spend at each site .i believe the most wonderful thing about traveling is that you get to meet people from all over the world , but if you travel in a group , you are less likely to interact with other travelers .i visited spain this september on my own , and became acquainted with travelers from us , france , morocco , and china on the train and at football stadiums , and we exchanged information on the best places to visit .i still correspond with one of them .
