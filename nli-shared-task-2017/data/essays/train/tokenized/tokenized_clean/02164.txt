better use of public transportation and different travelling habits , leading to fewer cars : surely , this is the way many ecologists dream of the ideal future .but is it truly realistic ?not many arguments available today support this vision .quite the opposite , in fact , seems to be taking place .first , urban planning tends to induce an increased use of cars .the taste for individual homes , with gardens , away from the city s pollution , encourages urban sprawl .the result of this is that any travelling needs a car .shops , malls , museums , are simply too far away from the suburbs for people to simply walk there .some might argue that the oncoming limitation in available oil ressources , as well as the growing concern about global warming , might change people s behaviors .however , one could challenge this view by noticing the current improvements in engines  technologies .they tend to make cars cleaner and less polluting .this could make the moral dilemna to use the car or not an irrelevant one .cars will change , not how often people use them .another important factor lies in the needs of developing countries .china , india and brazil nowadays , and other countries tomorrow , have a growing middle class and urban population .these people can afford to buy a car , even two .they might also start having country houses , and cars are often necessary to travel there .lastly , i believe travel by car corresponds to a deep trend in our modern individualistic society .people , when confronted with a choice , would rather travel alone or with their families than with random strangers in a closed space .this shows that time and money are not the only factors when people have to choose between different ways to travel .how good you feel , how freely you can behave when in a car , could outweigh seemingly more relevant arguments .the tendency in the industry to customize each car for the individual customer is an illustration of the importance of this `` feel-good  factor .all in all , i think these arguments tend to go against the statement that the number of cars in use will decrease .cars and the uses of cars will evolve - but their numbers are not likely to go down .
