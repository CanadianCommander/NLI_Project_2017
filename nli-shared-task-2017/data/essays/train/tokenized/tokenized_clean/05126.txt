there were always innovations and people who try something new .there are three reasons why i think that it is important to try new things and to take risks to be successful .first , if people take the risk to sell its new idea they have the possibility to be very successful .new ideas have the characteristic that nowbody else offers this idea or product .for example , bill gateshad the idea of a new computer software .he was successful because he was the first who sold his idea and he took the risk of losing all his money .second , humans always need to develope new products .for example , medicaments for new illnesses .scholars have to take the risk , that the medicament does not work or causes other illnesses .before the medicament can be sold to the people it has to be tested for a long time .if the tests are not successful , the work of the scholars is not worth anything .the scholars want to develpe something new and take the risk .third , new things and innovations are very interresting .people like new electronic devices , dangerous attractions in theatres or shows and new tastes and smells for food or deodorant .every company that developes a new product has to invest money to invent it .after the company has to pay money for marketing , product placement and so on to sell its product successful .the amount of money the company spends is the risk it takes .but without taking the risk it has to sell its old products but mostly costumers do not want old products .they are only successful if they take the risk and be the first company that offers a new product .in conlusion , these three reasons show that it is important to use new ideas and innovations and to take risks to be successful .
