where i live , japan , poeple spend their vacation on travel around the world .therefore , there are many tours designed by tour companies .some pepole prefer to take these tours with friends led by a tour guide , but i find more advantages that planning a tour by myself is suitable for me .therefore i disagree with this statement .of course , there are some advantages to travel led by a tour guide .for instance , people feel at ease when they are led by a tour guide who know very well about the area which they visit .also , sometimes a tour less costs to stay hotel or transpotation than pay by myself .although there are some advantages to take a tour , i definitely choose to travel by myself .the primary reason that i can cite is i can more enjoy a tour with free plan , bacause i do nt feel comfortable if i have to travel with a person who i have nt met before .it is more comfortable for me to travel alone or with friends .socondly , if i travel led by a tour , i feel i have to be punctual even though it s my vacation , my precious day off , because i must not make a tour plan confused and get others in trouble .on the other hand , i can take my time to visit , buy something or eat nice meals as long as i want .i do nt feel guilty at all .thereforeas i mentioned so far i definitely choose to travel without a tour guide otherwise i feel stressed on my precious time .i just want to enjoy and relax on my vacation effectively .
