learning is a never ending process .but it is very important for one to know `` how much to know  .putting forth my disagreement for the statement i would like to present my opinion about the topic .in my opinion having knowledge of many academic subjects is fairly justified to a very primary level , till the time one get s to know the basics of that subject .but it is very important to have detailed knowledge about one subject in particular .to elaborate this point further i would like to detail the factor of ones aptitude that comes into play .it is not necessary for a person to have strong affinity for a whole array of subjets than compared to a subject in particular .this affinity can be potentially put to use by furher breeding ones liking for a paticular subject .this can only be achieved by gaining detailed knowledge about that specific subject .lets take an example of a creative field like architecture , where the primary education that the syllabus provides gives one a rough idea about lots of subjects pertaining to history , evolution and practical implications of architectural design .but the entire course focuses and deals with these subjects at a very primary level .the amount of contribution a good architect can make to the society can be very crucial in defining the era a society comes from and to be in a position to make that level of contribution and has to have a very deep rooted understandng of the strata of society , the nature and behavorial pattern of people .and this can be achieved only when ones understands the nuances of a subject in concern .this not only provides a zest and encouragement to do better but can set examples for the comming generations .this understanding has to be inculcated at a very nascent stage so that right decisions can be taken by individuals which broadens the horizons not only for ones personal development but could lead us into a refined and a resolved tommorow .
