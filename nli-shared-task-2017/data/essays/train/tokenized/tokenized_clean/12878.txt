for a long time , every people have studied a lot .we must learn with many subjects , for example history , mathematics , english , and science .we must know the facts to learn , although it is not enough .i think we must know the ideas and concepts too .in genaral , children can memorise more than adults , because their brains are softer .though , it will become more difficult to memorise with their growth .but i heard if there are some concepts or ideas with facts , we do not forget .there an example .when we are studing world history , we must know about the world wars .the facts are just learn the countries which involved these wars or the people who started to fights .we memorise them at this time , but we will forget someday .however , if teacher give students a chance to think about these countries thinking , and they will not forget this experience easily .because it will become student s experience , it not just learn about history .secondary ,
