in my life i have visited a variaty of nations .i have come to comprehend the complexity of some cultures as well as the unique characteristics each nation provides .each cultural enviroment provides a characteristic to mandkind s identity .the language , the food and the history every nation in the world provides is be experienced when one travels to that nation .once we are surrounded by that culture we can explore it in a variaty of ways .two ways are by ourselfs and by guidence of a tourguide .what i have come to realize is that a trip becomes more gratifying , as well as at the same time it provides a greater cultural aspcet of the nation , when does it with a tour guide .although the first argument against my opioin is that with a guide we are attained to his shcedule this comes to play a small part in the desire turist have to adquire knowledge from a foreing nation .it might be true that with a group and a guide we are enshrouded in a surrounding where desicions are made by the majority .what comes to be more relevant is that although as an individual in a grup we are unable to decide where to go as an individual we do not know where to go .in order to adquire a diverse aspect of the culture we visit we must learn what characterizes the culture .a tour guide is more than able to explain where the culture of the nation stands out for its unique characteristics .a tour guide provides as well what i personally seek in a trip , knowdlege about the nations history .by ourselfs we are able to visit far more scenarios but at the same time we are unable to grasp the meaning behind each scenario .in a trip i preffer to see few scenarios but once i come home i return with a load of cultural background conserning each scenario i visited .the pleasure each experience grants me is greater when i know the social , political , economic and historic background that the experience withholds .some do not like the pressure a group imposes .i rather think of the shcedule in a group as the best way to handle my time in a trip .with a shcedule i regulate the time it takes me to visit each place in the culture i seek to explore .i preffer to know what i should learn from rather than wander around the city i visit .as an individual i would get of track my trip when i start to think of what i must do in order to get the most gratification out of my time in that nation .a guide provides information , a schedule and when we combine these two aspects a guide comes to provide a vast cultural knowldge i desire to discover .what a trip evokes in my mind is an unsaciable thrist of knowledge .this thrist would unlikely be calm down by my own .it is best if i have someone that is able to give me the background information of the mation i visit .by visitng a nation with a guide and a group i also learn from a new perspective .what to me might be intresting to some member of my group that same object stands out as dull .a guide and a group come to provide experiences , poins of view , cultural knowledge that when put together create a cultural diversity which comes to transalte into a remarkable trip .
