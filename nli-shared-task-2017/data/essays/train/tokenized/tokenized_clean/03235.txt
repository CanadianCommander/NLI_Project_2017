life is worth to live .young people live it more lively and older people live it in a more plain way within their physical limits , but they woud have lived it lively when they were young .i agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more as compared to older people .young people are more energetic and more ambitious in their youth .they have the desire to bring sky down .young people have the quality of persistence that is to keep trying to achieve their goal .this ability of theirs helps them to enjoy life and face all the hardships whatever comes on their way .for eg. : youths always try new methods of entertainment which is full of dangers and risks .like bungee jump , car race etc .young people are always open to new ideas and they have the desire to explore the world .they implement new thoughts in teir way of living and enjoy life to the full .at the same time old people are not able to enjoy more in life .they spend most of the time in the memories of what they did in their young age .they are even not physically fit to do all the activities which a youth can do .in the old age the ability of persistence reduces .old people dont have the desire to compete with the world to get the best .they always remain happy in what they have and in the way how they live .they are never open to new modern ideas and are not able to enjoy life as compared to youths .finally i would like to say that , i am not against the old people .these are the people when young developed new ideas which the youg generation of this age is following and enjoying .
