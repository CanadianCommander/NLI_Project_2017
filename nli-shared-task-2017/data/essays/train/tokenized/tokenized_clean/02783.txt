the more capitalism governs the lives of people around the world , the more we are introduced with newcoming products and ideas every day .most of the nations in our world has become comsumption communities and more nations are on the way .what is a consumption community ?it is a community which acquires pleasure from consuming as a primary act of daily life .if there is consumption , it is not surprising to see the inevitable rise of advertisement sector hiding behind it , whose primary aim is to make products seem much better than they really are .advertisements are in everyone s life .it is enough to listen to radio , watch tv , even walk on the street to meet advertisements .when one thinks about all the huge money invested into advertisements , you get more tended to trust in the product that is exploited in the advertisement .at least , that was what i thought , until i had taken the consumer behavior course in my university .i can honestly tell you that this course has changed my consumption patterns to great extent .in the course , we were provided with detailed information of sales strategies such as how to make a product attractive to consumers , where to put the product on the supermarket to increase its sells , how to jump into people unconscious and make them buy the product unintentionally or how to make people addicted to a product .it may sound just normal to you , but to me it is great dishonesty .that is how i started to question everything i buy and consume .for instance , there are many shampoos claiming that they are the best hair conditioners in the market .but if every brand claims that , which one the consumers have to believe ?have you ever questioned why there are always beautiful girls and handsome boys in the adds ?since they give you the message ; `` if you buy me , you would be as beautiful as the girl in my add  .here is another example , in car adds , usually for big cars , we always watch cool and successful businessmen who works in high skycrapers and lots of money , giving the message `` if you drive me , you would make lots of money  .although these examples may sound stupid to you , this is what actually happens in our brain .our cognition is so vulnerable that it can not defend itself to all these symbol bombardments .to conclude , advertisement industry is meant to make their customer brands  products seem much better than they really are .this is how millions of brands compete with another .they have to catch the attention of people on the market , on the street and at home .only then he could achieve his targeted profit .we can not deny the fact that human nature has a tendency to have pleasure from buying the symbols , not the product itself .as a consequence , you find yourself as a part of consumer community .
