i agree to this statement .first , the technologies are growing so i think there will be more better transportations invented .using cars has many demerits like traffic jam and car accidents .recently i see many car accidents on the news report .especially by the drunk drivers .i think there were be more better invension after twenty years .also , recently , the increasing of the carbon dioxide has been a serious problem in the world .it causes global warming which is very serious .this causes the ices in the north and the south poles melt .then the sea levels increases and many lands will be covered with sea waters .there are already an island that has been influenced by this problem .so japan has been working on to decrese the carbon dioxide such as the kyoto protocol .i think the main cause of the increasing of the carbon dioxide is the cars .the fossils and oils pollutes the air and increases the carbon dioxide .so i think the best way to solve this problem is to forbid cars .in twenty years , this problem will be more serious in the earth .many countries will be influenced by this and i think there were be no more solution other than to lessen cars .from these reasons i think there will fewer cars than today after twenty years .
