i definetly agree with this statement .most advertisement make products seem much bette than they really are .people who do those advetisement , just do their job , in fact they must make the product seem far better than it s , becquse of the concurence .indeed , now in our society , firms has to be the best , whatever the way they to be .there to much choice whatever is the product you wnt to buy , for instance , there very big of shampoo , when you go to the super maket you can even not know what to buy .and then advertisement has a very importante role .an adevrtisement have to show that thr product that it s presenting is the best one , and that you really need that one particulary .besides , people are very influencable by that , and that normal , if you don  like an advertisement , you would not buy the product , because you will think it s a bad one , even though in reality it s much better than you think .well according to my own experience , advertisement really make products seem bettre , for example juste last week , i was about to buy a new perfum , i was thinking that it was good , and the bottle was very cute , and it was a very famous perfum , but in spite of all , wanted to taste , so i did , and it was simply a catastrophe .what we should remerber , it s that the advertisement is just business , it s people who wants to make money , and as a result they do their best to present their products on the best way .in conclusion , you should always taste before to believe .
