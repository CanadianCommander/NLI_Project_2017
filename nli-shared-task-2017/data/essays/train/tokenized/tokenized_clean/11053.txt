some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .in a few aspects , i agree this idea , but generaly i do nt agree this idea .i do nt support the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .because , according to my life concept , enjoyment of the life does nt depends to people s age .enjoyment of the life depends on the persons  characteristics .in my company , there are two examples to this topic .the first example is that one of the my colleagues is who is twenty years old is very pessimistic .she does nt enjoy life .she acts as if she is going to die tomorrow .for that reason , she does nt enjoy life .second example is that i have a fifty-three years old coworker .she enjoys life more than my young friend who is twenty years old and very pessimistic .the old lady is always happy .she makes plans for nights and weekends for fun .every year she travels abroad , takes pictures and tells all of the colleagues .also , she is very funny , somedays she praperes small jokes for our young and for pessimistic colleagues to make her optimistic .also , i am familiar with that some peoples  age affect their life vision .for example , with my mother we go wedding ceremonies , i invite my mother for traditional dances .my mother sometimes refuses me and says that she is too for dance old , intead of older peoples youngers could play .i think my mothers age affects her , and diminishes her enjoyment of life .some people think that enjoyment of life has coherrent relationship with age , but on the contrary i believe that people enjoyment of life is depend on their characteristics .as i implied before one of the my twenty years old coworker less enjoys life .but , on the other side my fifty-three years old collegue enjoys life more than my younger friend .
