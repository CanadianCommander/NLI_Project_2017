i honestly can not say for sure if or if not there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are right now .there are several reasons why there are still cars in the future .one is that having an own car is much more comfortable - right now and probably also in the future .you do nt need to sit in an overcrowded train or buss to go to work .another point is the structure of public transport .for getting rid of cars the government has to make sure that almost every point in the country has to be connected by buss or any other kind of public transport .this would cost an enormous amount of money which would nt be affordable for any state .especially for states like usa , canada or sweden where the biggest part of the population still lives on the countryside .but on the other side i honestly belive that even with the discribed problems the amount of cars will be reduced over the next twenty years .mainly because of the prices for fuel and cars .almost nobody can afford a car for almost 30000 euros anymore .the prices for fuel rise up even in the states so that there will be a need for an improved public transport system .another point is the air pollution in bigger cities .by visiting cities like los angeles , new york or even dallas - it gets on some days even almost impossible to breathe . ..most of that does nt affect us right now - but i am pretty sure it will turn in the next couple of years .finally it is to say that there are a lot more reasons why there will be lot less cars in the future but in the short time it was unfortunatelly not possible to mention mor important ones .
