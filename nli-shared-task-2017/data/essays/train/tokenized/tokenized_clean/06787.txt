young people are enjoy life more than older people .even if this speach does nt make a sence to people it has some logical reasons .in today s world there are a lot s of opportunities for young people that technology provides .i think technology and enjoyment of youg people in our day are very parallel to each other because of several opportunities that technology provides since 15 years .the most important technological achievment is internet .the adventage that internet provides for young people is to learn better and communicate better with their friends for instance .so even this can prove young people enjoys their life better than older people .in addition if we think that older people are using thecnology as young people do it is absolutely true .however this though brings a new question that even if older people could use the technology and the achievments as good as young people does .i think even though older people can use the thecnology they can not figure it out as young people does .on the other hand the time that youg people living in earth are very lucky because ther lifes are not limited because of the political reasons if we think this in borders of turkey and many other countries too .young people are free to experience what ever they like to and go where ever they like to go in feeling of freedom .maybe if i ask my mother that which of us are enjoying the life she would defenately told me that we are enjoying much more .several days ago we were invited as a guest in a family friend , the thing that tooks my attention was their memories about their yought years and they told us young people in the dinner that we are lucky to be young and they advise us to enjoy it .offcourse being old has some enjoyments in its own frame .in instance thay enjoy our growth , success and happiness at the same time .because for a family the biggest reason for being happy is their young children s happines .finally , young people should have their best years by learning more and more so they can extand their view of life and enjoy their times as good as they can before the responsibilities takes a big part of their lifes .
