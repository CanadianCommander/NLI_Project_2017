i personally agree with the statment about the advertisement , which says `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .as time goes , the number of the firms in the market is constantly incresing , and those firms are competing with one another in order to survive in the market .since they want consumers to buy their products , they are making so many creative advertisements .that is why there are flooding advertisements in the newpaper or television .but i think it is unfortunately true that the new copies advertisements thesedays are more like alluring the consumers eyes , preventing the consumer from making the right decisions , as they are losing their originally meaning which is providing the usefull information .as other consumers of the modern society , i have experienced it in so many ways in my everyday life .when i was in the primary school , i dreamed about having the human-sized barbie doll .my desire was basically coming from the advertisement in which a girl and a huge barbie doll were dancing together and putting makeups on each others faces .the advertisement was saying that the barbie doll can play with a little girl , moving however the girl wished it to move .since i did not have any sister , i really wished i could have had such a doll with which i could dance and play .of course i did not think about the exaggeration of the advetisements , neither did my mother .one day my mom ened up buying me that huge doll , but i could not do anything i imagined i could do with the doll .the overall advetisement was exaggerating , and the doll was not even be able to stand by itself .relatively , my disappointment was great .not only as a consumer , i experienced the exaggeration of the advertisement but also as a producer .when i was in middle school , the student government where i belonged to desperatively needed money for the upcoming school festival .so we decided to sell some toys which we purchased from the local dollor tree .but later on , i was greatly disappointed at the school student government when i witnessed the exaggerating advertisement copy we had to make , because none of the copies was hesitating to mention that the toys were from the luxiourious toystore , which was not true .from my experience , i learned that the copy of the advertisement is hardly revealing the truth .i think it is quite understandable becuase i know how hard it is to sell something for a seller while it is competing with other sellers .but i still can not agree with that one can buy something only considering what the advertisement says , because i know the advertisement is relatively supposed to be quite exaggerating .
