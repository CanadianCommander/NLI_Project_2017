i totally agree withe statement because , due to following reasons :1. as the population increases , the usage of cars is increased day by day and one day it will reach to peak level where there is no space to park or drive the car .2. secondarily , as the pollution increases usage of cars may be reduced and also avilability and price of the fuel has also been raised which may lead to fewer cars in use .3. as the traffic increases public prefer to travel by public transport inspite of taking stress and strain to travel by cars in the traffic .4. due to increased production of variety of cars year by year and increase in the price of the car , public may not afford to buy the car .5. many people who would like to travel long distance they dont usually prefer travelling by cars instead they take public transport system to travel .6. there may be other reason which can be guessed of less car usage is , if the cars are affordable to buy by the middle class families it may become a traffic problem as more public tend to buy the cars instead .7. nowadays , buying a car is easy , but due to higher growing fuel price .maintenance of the car has become expensive .8. due to higher usage of cars there may be shortage of parking space in the offices for the employees to park their cars .9. there may be higher risk of road accidents .so , may be in twenty years there will be surely less usage of cars as compared today .
