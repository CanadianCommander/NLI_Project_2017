yes , i agree with this idea .now a days , too many cars are running in the raod , in the city , every where .i have read in the newspaper with the research , 70percent of the families has thiere own car , and many of them in a family has the average car of two .the problem here is , the cars are polluting the air , and too many cars are leading us to traffics .many people are stressed with this problem also .so the people here in korea recently started riding bus or subways going to work and home .but still , many cars .not only the cars are polluting , but the soaps and trashes . .etc .when i walk around , i even can smell the bad gas on the air , and the part , it is getting worse .so many scientist and people are searching and trying to reduce the pollutions .and the fasted way to lessen is by riding bus or subways .we surely have to do something about this , if we love our country .let s say for example , like advertising alot , teaching our kinds , and leaving the car often at house parking lot , riding with neigh if we want to live in a beautiful country , ofcourse we have to take good care of our home place also .so no matter what the reason is , we have to start as soon as possible .by twenty years from now , i agree that there will be fewer cars .changing few habby s will save our world .
