most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i am disagree with this statement because a lot of twince the products are only beautiful but do nt do their work .for example cloths , pc , tv . ..are very important for their signature and beautiful for their colors but are nt good pieces .my sister buys a lot of products very cheapy but after a season she ca nt use their because are broke and i am very tired with my sister .i will never buy a cheap cloth because i like change very often my product and i do nt want use a lot of money .
