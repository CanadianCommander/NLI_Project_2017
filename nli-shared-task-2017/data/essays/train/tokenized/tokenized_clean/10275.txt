methods of teaching are essential for the students to learn and understand things and apply those in real life .so it is important to choose which method shall be used .indeed , students can be educated by helping them learning about the facts , but would it be enough ?since learning starts with comprehension the definition and essence of things , which are theoratical ideas and concepts .addition to that , learning about ideas and concepts can improve the students  argumentative abilities , and lead them not rely on an only one truth .regarding those , making the students learn things by facts does not seem to be an effective method .indeed the theoratical concepts can be boring for the students and may cause them to loose their focus .but in order to understand and comprehend something , they would need the know the definition and the essence of things .learning facts can be practical but can never provide the sufficient information for the students .despite the fact that , learning about and studying on facts can help the students to overcome certain problems that they may encounter , these circumstances are limited .if a student s argumentative ability is not developed enough , then he or she may not able to use the potential creativity he or she has .thus when students encounter events or issues that can not be explained by a specific fact , they can not come up with different soultions since they would not know about the essence and the logic of the problem they encounter .to conclude , although teaching the actual facts may contribute to students understanding and learning of things in life , it may help them to a limited extent .as long as they are not concerned the ideas and concepts , in other words , the essence and the logic of the things , they can neither develop a more creative and argumentative point of view nor can be successful enough in their future lives .
