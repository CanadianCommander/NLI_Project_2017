the industry of cars has developed rapidly in recent years in china .the percentage of families which owns at least one car is growing fast .there s an opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , the development of cars will not end and the number of cars will not decrease in the future .first , traveling by car is a convenient and necessary way of transportation in our daily lives .we need cars all the time , when we go to school or work in the morning , when we return home in the evening , when we go on a trip to the grassland or the mountains , even when we go to a supermarket for shopping .cars are used so wildly and often that we can not imagine a kind of life in which there are no cars or fewer cars .second , though there are some problems traveling by car , they can be solved in the future .cars can pollute the air , but researches to reduce the pollution of cars are on the progress .there are already cars using electric power which do not harm the environment .for another example , the roads may be too crowded for cars to go fast , but newly-built highways and freeways are solving the problem .third , if we use fewer cars in twenty years , which mean of transportation should we use ?by airplane , by helicopter , by subway , by bike , or just on foot ?in the modern society , the speed required for transportation is faster and faster .therefore , traveling by bike or on foot is too slow .traveling by subway seems fast and convenient , but what about people living far from subway stations ?finally , airplanes and helicopters are too expensive for common people and too dangerous .in conclusion , although cars have some disadvantages , the necessity of using them is still strong .more convenient types of cars will be developed in the future .therefore , there will never be fewer cars in use than there are today .
