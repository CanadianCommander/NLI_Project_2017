in my opinion , in the first part of our academic path , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .there are many reasons which support my point of view .first of all , people need to have a good knowledge of the most of subjects in order to understand which is the one they like most .how can we know what we like if we do nt know the distinct possibilities ?otherwise , without a 360 degrees view , he would nt be able to say which is his our favourite field of interest .the second point regards the importance of any single subject .each one of those transmits something unique and unsubstitutable .as mathematics developes our right part of the brain , literature and art work on the left one .and the same concept could be inferred to all other subject .the study of a given subject , does nt only increase our knowledge of it , but improves also some of our personal skills and i think we need any kind of capacities in order to to be successful in life .another important point is about the social consequences of a high bandwidth knowledge .being informed on a lot of subject opens us the chance to have conversations in distinct contexts and thus the chance of knowing distinct people .i think it is very important in a man s life to have a large variety of knowledges because it could lead to an active social life .however , even if it has to be most consistent part , i think a horizontal study of many academic subject has to be necessarly followed by a more vertical phase .after we have understood what we prefer we need to get specialized in something in order to create our main interest , upon which we might build our future and our job .
