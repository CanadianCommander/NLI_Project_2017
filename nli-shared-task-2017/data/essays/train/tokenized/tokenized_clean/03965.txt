the world today demands for students to understand that an education is a tool that is used to `` keep the world going .now , many students choose to learn the bare minimum to get by in their professional careers , and are exempting from their lives that understanding concepts and ideas is more important than to just learn quick facts .in my experience understading a specific subject in a class has enriched my learning abilities , and given me the satisfaction of understanding every detail of that specific course .i have seen many of my classmates barely get by through school , because they rely on learning quick facts , pass coursed , and then receive a diploma so they can join the work force .i strongly belive that they join the real world unprepared .the student body that uses facts as a method of learning will have incovienient disabilities understanding concepts later in life becuase they will not know how to analyze situations correctly and solve problems .as simple as a fact can be , it may influence learning significantly , for example , fact : if students use the method `` memory dump  as soon as they receive the test , it will help them to do better .well , if students would rely more on understading the subject matter and the ideas they are being tested on prior to the exam , they would not have to rely on `` memory dump .i am in complete accordance with students experiencing life through understading concepts and ideas , since this way they may always be able to spread their knowlege with other people .just imagine living life with only facts , that many times are uneccessary and vague , whereas to live life with the full knowledge that you can explain or simply express any topic due to the understading you aquired during your learning period .
