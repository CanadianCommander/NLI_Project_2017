successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with the following statement .i think that trying new things is good for the world and help us to do better and have a better life .people who know about one topic want to change what they know .for example the scientists already know a lot of things about the deseases but they are still struggling to give us a better life and better chance to stay alive .the successful people are successful because they demonstrate a new things for the life on earth .they want to know more because they want to improve the quality of life and also earn lot of money .we have computers since a long time but every time people work on it to improve it and make it easy for us to work .i think that the world is running and all the things in this world have to run too .at the past we had the airplanes but they are not like those for today .people make it faster and agreable for customers .they take risks because they believe in what they are doing .as a result they win the challenge and make a lot of money .by trying new things they are learning new things and they use those things to create special machines .at the past we had a telephone which was big and was very uncomfortable .people worked to improve the quality of outgoing and incoming call and the size because they want to simplify our life .now we have a small telephone which is called cellphones .we do not need to stay at home to receive a call .with this new technology of wirelless and other i can have my with me and go out .i m able to have a call .those new things became reality because people try new things take risks .those people could not do research and today we will not have all this kind of machines .also they are trying new things because they know that they could make money .i agree with the statement .
