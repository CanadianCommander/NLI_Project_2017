i disagree to the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .this statement contrasts with the quote `` jack of all trade master of none  .not only academics this state is false for every kind of work .i would tell my certian personal examples .in my college i play football , cricket , weightlifting , powerlifting .despite of playing so many games i have not been selected till today in my any of the college teams .when i am dropped out by the selection committee then i feel that it would have been better if i would have devoted my entire time on a single game and do mastery in that instead of playing many games .when we talk about the world famous authors they mostly have specialisation in a single subject .for example william shakespeare was famous for english literature , issac newton was famous in sciences , etc .there are endless examples about different personalities who have achieved success by doing specialization in one specific subject .so i would conclude this paragraph by stating that for getting renowned in your school , state , country or world you should have specialization in a specific subject unless you put in your best efforts in that .most of the people face unemployment because they try to put their hands and legs in many works which reduces their chances of success in that .it is just as a person standing on two boats and trying to navigate the river .so i would end with a famous quote that `` single bird in a hand is better than many birds in a bush
