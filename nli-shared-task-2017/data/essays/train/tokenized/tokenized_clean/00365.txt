i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the statement is true .young people nowadays are very busy with their schedules .they do not have time to involve in the activities that help their communities .for example , my brother who is working as a software engineer is busy with his job working late nights on tasks assigned to him .so he doesnthave that much time to engage himself for helping his community .the young people nowadays are lacking the sense of helping .many people are thinking about what they get in return after helping their communities .for example , i met a young minister in our locality .he was very reluctant to help the community people because he thinks that he does nt get anything in return from them and its a meagre waste of granting funds to them .although some young people are getting enough time to help others they are simply wasting their time .for example , my cousin who is a teacher , after returning from the school , simply wastes the remaining time just by idling or watching t.v .the current generations , particularly students are engrossed in their studies and sports rather than making an effort to help others .some people are wasting their money by spending it on waste activities such as drinking , smoking etc .if they spend this money on helping their community it will be very useful for the people .some young people are in the mad race for acquiring lands .if they donate these lands to the homeless in the community , atleast they can build houses and provide shelter for themselves .finally i conclude that helping his own community is the most essential function of young people .they should spare time for helping .
