the human kind always need enjoying to reach good life standarts therefore enjoying is one of the most important aspects of human life .everyone has different point of views about the idea of enjoying .some believes that young people enjoy life more than older person do and i totally agree with the idea .these are my following ideas .first of all , youngers have more oppurtunity to enjoy more than olders .a lot of sports and enjoying activities are generally made for young persons because of the fact that they are motre healthier and powerful to enjoy the activities .for example , out door activities are very enjoable and realy provide youngers to have good times .however these need a strong body and heart to feel the enjoying point of adrenalin .in addition to this , youngers have less problems to enjoy more than olders .generally young persons have less responsibility about life .moreover they have less health problems to survive .all of these enable them to enjoy more and have good times .for instance , my grandfather has some money and health problems .hence all of these prevent him to enjoy more than an independent child .the last but not least , youngers have more time to meet the world and taste new things of it .for example forty years ago there is not the sport of paragliding and the people of the past couldnot find time to taste the enjoyablity of the sport .however , paragliding is my favorite sport and i can realy enjoy and have good times with my friends in pragliding trips .all in all , as i said before young people enjoy life more than older persons .enjoying is related with both more oppourtunity and less problems as well as more time to taste new things .the long and the short of it is that , yong persons should try to find the way of enjoying until they become older .
