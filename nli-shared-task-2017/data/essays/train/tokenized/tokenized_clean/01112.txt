there are a lot of people who think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my opinoin , i totally agree with this statement because the young have a more healthier body , also the world is new to them .we can not deny that the young have more healthier bodies which make they can enjoy their life much better .nowadays there are many activities and sports for people to relax themselves such as the hiking , swimming .but these activities and sports have something in common , a good body .for example , the hiking request people being strong and full of energy .even some young are not dare to try the hiking , so how could the older people ?moreover , now many travels is not permitted to the people who have the heart diseases .as we know , it is a common diseases among the older .for example , once my family decided to go to tibetan to have a journey , unforturenatly my grand-father was not allowed to go there because of his heart diseases .many young people are curious to the new field than older people .because the whole world seems to be new to him .there are a lot of food or sceneries they have never experienced before .but as to the older people , they are always stubborn and they do not listen to others  advices .when i asked my father to go to seaside , he always responced me that he was not willing to go .because in his mind , the sea is no different although it is in the different areas and going to seaside would not appear him any more .but the young people never have this feeling .all in all , from the reasons and example given above , we can easily draw the conclusion the young people enjoy life than older people do .
