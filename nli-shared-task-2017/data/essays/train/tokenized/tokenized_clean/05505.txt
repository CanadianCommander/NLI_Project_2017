the issue is a controvertial one .on one hand the issue states that there are young people who contributes to their communities .on the other hand , the issue claims that young people are not helping their communities at all .however in my final analysis , i would support that young people are giving enough time to help their communities .the first instance in support of my view are the non-residential indians .they are young people who work outside india .inspite of there busy schedule , they come back to the home country and conduct lot of sessions .they also help financial institutions in india by providing them financial aid .they actively participate in the events and promotions done by the government of india .my second example are the young politians those are coming up in various countries .people like tony blair of united kingdon is a fascinating example of a young person helping his community and country .politics has now become one of the means by which young people are contributing .another example would be people like michael johnson from basketball and mark waugh from cricket .these sports person have taken time out for child welfare .they have also setup various sports academy , to help nourish young talent in their respective fields .these people always make it a point to visit their respective academy .finally , the musicians like yanni have conducted charitable shows .many other young musicians also conduct charitable shows to generate reveneues .singers like michael jakson is known for conducting such charitable shows .this money is used for the development for their community .in conclusion , i feel that young people of this era are actively participating for the cause to help their communities grow .the above examples are just a few to quote .
