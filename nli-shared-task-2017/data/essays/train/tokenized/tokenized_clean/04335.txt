the author is arguing that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i agree with the author point of view .the number of advertisements has increased .while watching a tv show , a person will have an interupting advertisement period in the tv .in addition , most newspapers have specified a number of pages for products advertisements .this huge number of advertisement has affected our thinking about different products .companies spends millions of dollars to create convincing advertisements .this spending is considered part of the marketing stratigies .it is well believed that the more advertisement there is for a product , the more it is sold .the millions of dollars that are spent on advertisement is considered only a small amount of money in big companies such as pizza hut .however , these companies do not care if they have to lie in presenting accurate information about their products .because of the colored and well designed advertisements , consumer will be confused about the real quality of the product .because of advertisements , some products have become more expensive regardless of their quality .for example , toshiba labtop is a well known brand .through out the years , toshiba has proved that they have good quality laptops .overtime , toshiba laptops has become expensive .moreover , people around the world have got an idea stick in their mind that toshiba laptops are the best .however , being a computer specialist , i have noticed that toshiba computers quality has declined .few weeks ago toshiba company had to withdraw laptop batteries from the market for a specific toshiba laptop .poeple who are not interested in reading information technology news will not know about the battery withdrawal .they will remain in believing that toshiba laptop is always the best .about nine months ago , i was convinced because of an advertisment that assets air conditionars are of good quality .the company that is advertisement for this brand is well known in my country oman .after buying two assets air conditioners , i found out that these conditionars are not as was advertised for .i could nt stand having them for one months .i had to purchase new air conditionars .people spend a lot of money because of the misleading advertisements .they do not bother searching more about the product before buying it .it is maybe not worth it to search the internet before buying a can of beans , but it worths a lot to search before buying an expensive products such as a car .
