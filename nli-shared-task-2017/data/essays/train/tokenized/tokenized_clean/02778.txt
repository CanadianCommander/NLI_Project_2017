i personly believe , that in the modern world it is essential to have specific knowledge .life in the modern world ins influenced by computers , machinery and complex problems therefore it needs well educated people to solve those problems .for example , nobody is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flue if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs .the same applays to a lawyer .today the field of law is so complex that it is not possible for one person to have an overlook over all existing statuts or decisions .a lawyer practising in family law typically does not understand the functioning of a company .therefore if you operate a company or you are planning to do a merger you are trying to find the best possible lawyer available .you need an expert who knows what he is doing and is making sure that you are not in the risk of liablity .you need a lawyer who specified in corporate law , who is an expert in m & a , somebody who knows the court decisions and all statues possibly beeing effected by the merger .somebody who does not put his whole afford in that one thing ( area of practice ) will not be able to compete with other lawyers in the field and most important , he will not be able to get the best possible solution possible .of course it is very important that people do have a wide knowledge and that includes for example knowledge of literature and music but that does not mean that he should not be an expert in something .i believe that everybody should take differend classes in college but he should focus on one area .it is essential to know how a computer is operating but you will not call a lawyer or doctor to fix your problems with microsoft .since problems will become more specific at the one hand and more people are unemployed on the other side it is neccesary that people specialice in on field , so that they will have a chance on the job market .not like a century ago people today do not have to be a farmer , construction worker and fisherman at the same time .as stated above i believe that the complex world makes it even more important that people specialize in a specific subject .
