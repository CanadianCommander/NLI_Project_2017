in general , people keep much knowledge along their studies and are able to use these knowledge in the life .while some people prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject other prefer the reversed situation of the previous statement .in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .firstly , i prefer specialization in one specific subject because it will allow me to improve my skills in this specialization .for example , i prefer to study all time in n only one field to be able to study in depth all the phenomenon which are in this feild .also , it will permit me to be an expert of my specialization .secondly , it is better to do a specialization because i will permit me to be well organized .for instance , my schedule of study will not be shared into many different academic subjects .then , i could be relax to manage my time to do an excellent work .on contrary , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not a good way because a person who does it will not have time to study in depth all these subjects .as an example , someone who wants to study in the same time physic , philosophy , theology and law will not be able to know deeply each of these subjects .also , it is wrong to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because i will not have enough time to do all my works accuretly .such a person who has to submit within a tiny time eight or ten tremendous works , it will be very difficult for him to do good work and submit works on time .in sum , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has disadvantages and specializing in one specific subject has advantages .as far as i m concerned , it is better to specialize in one subject .people should specialize in one specific subject in their studies .
