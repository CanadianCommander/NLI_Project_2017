someone says it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic sudjects than to specialize in one specific suject .i ca nt agree on this statement .because obtaining specialize knowledge is more inportant than obtaining broad knowledge of variuos subjects .my statement mainly based on the following reasons :first , with the bloom of the information development , it is mostly impossible the obtain all the knowledge of one specific subject , not to metion obtaining all the knowledge of a broad range of subjects .what was the use of a person who spend all his life in learning all the knowledge in the world , but doing nothing to used what he learn to contributed to the society ?second , to obtain that many knowlegde is a very time consuming process .sometime it could be a waste of time .and to choose a wide range of subjects means to secrify the depth of the things you learn .this may lead to a person difficult to live in a world that most , if not all , of the works are specificly cassify .and the most important reason is that , what a person will focus in his or her life , is usually one or tow field , it is really not nessesary to studied too many subjects , learning too much may not do any good to our future .why do nt we use the time we spend on the knowledge that may never be used in our life to something more related to ourself ?who will need to know how to cure aids when your job is the programming software to a supermaket ?in sum , i think that knowlegde are important to all of us , and it is a good thing to know more of the .but the more important things is how to use our limited time to learn the specific knowledge that will more likely be used in our life , but not wasting our life of what may come useless to us .
