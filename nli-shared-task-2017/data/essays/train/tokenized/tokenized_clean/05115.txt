i agree with the statement .i would rather say the advancement of civilization is the result of people who took risks .when i say taking risks it would mean not only doing things or acts personaly which could be dangerous , example going to the deep seas in search of new lands but that would also mean going against established ideas , which were wrong .had galileo and the earlier astronomers not challenged the idea of earth being flat we would never have known the facts .for going against the established beleifs , galileo and others had to face anger and punishments .had it not been the efforts of clombus we would have never seen america .he failed more than one time , was even improsined for failing to prove his theory , but in the end we owe him a lot .how is techonolgy advancing at such a great pace , we talk of nano technology today .it is because there are scientist who always challenge the established frontiers .this requires taking lot of risks .failure would mean wasting resources that are so costly .and also involve persona stigma , but than they dare it and succeed .the stories of scientist such as thomas alva edision , voltaaire are known to all .they were the people who tried out new things , even at the cost of people doubting them .wright brothers tried something new and brought a huge change in the world of transport , stevenson thought on a small issue and invented the steam engine .so the degree of risk might vary , but risks do result in some positive results .one thing i will like to add , the risks should not be blind , they should be calculated to some extent .this is applicable mostly for the purpose of trying out new business .infact all the people i have mentioned above had done some or the other study to be sure that they were not doing something that was completely not required .bill gates the richest man today , ventured into an unkown area and we see the result today .but it is not always that successful people have tried new things and they have succeeded .many example are there which tell that if you leave something which is your `` core compitency  you may fail .so the idea of `` core competency  is very relevent .so try new things but keep in mind your core competency also .
