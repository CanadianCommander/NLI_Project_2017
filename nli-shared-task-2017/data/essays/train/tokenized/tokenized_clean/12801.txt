depending on the personal experience , personalities types and emotional concerns , different person will have different opinions on whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in my eyes i strongly believe that learning facts is more useful .in other word , i disagree with the statement .i have several reasons for my propensity .the main reason is that only though learning facts would people get to know the ideas , concepts and the truth .thoughout the history , all the ideas is come from the obervations of facts .nobody could come to any kinds of conclusion without the research and the acumulation of data .for example , newton discover the rule of gravity from observe the apples falling from the tree .another reason canbe see by everybody is that thoery will not be able accepted without the detail and facts .why does most scientists conduct millions of experiments ?because they try to find the supports of their ideas .thus , it is more important for students to learn facts .that s all the reason why in the school experiment courses are provided .finally , learn facts is necessary for us to discover more ideas and concepts .this world is still full of mysteries .we need to solve them and find out the reasons , in other words , to get access to new thoery .only following the concepts gives by old people , never will our society develop .we ca nt deny the importance of understanding thoery , for the are the truth of the world and very helpfull to solve problems .however , those ideas was come from facts the scientist learned .all in all , considering all the factors above , we can easily draw the conclusion that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .
