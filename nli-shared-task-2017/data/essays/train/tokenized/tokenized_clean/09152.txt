knowledge is a very powerful tool .the more you know about something , the better informed and prepared you are on the subject .if having knowledge in one area is good , it s even better to know about many subjects .having an integral education provides you with the base to be able to speak , even if at short length , about many topics .you are able to move throughout a wider social spectrum because you can relate to a larger group of people .that being said i think it s important to specialize in one specific subject .experts have a very important place in our society .they are recognized by governments , academia and many other places .their specialized information is valued because other people do nt know it .specializing in one specific subject leads you down a path of expertise .even better is when you can specialize in more than one subject .this way , you can combine different fields and create new paths of knowledge .specializing in a subject ( whether it be one or more ) also opens a space to community .although a specific subject might not have a large range of people attached to it compared to people who have a broad knowledge , it is a more close and tightly knit group .there s a development of traditions , rules and language that pertain to that specific group .take into consideration medical and legal jargon , which might sound like a foreign language to people who do nt have knowledge in that specific field .it is a way to communicate with people from the same `` tribe  .people from similar fields also are able to develop very strong relationships because they can understand the complexities of a particular subject .we can not overlook the importance of having an education that comprises of a wide variety of subjects .this training enables you to be a constructive part of society .but since everyone ca nt be laying down blocks ( there s also need of solders , sculptors , painters , etc. ) , there is also a need to specialize in a particular field so you can offer society the best part of yourself : your knowledge .
