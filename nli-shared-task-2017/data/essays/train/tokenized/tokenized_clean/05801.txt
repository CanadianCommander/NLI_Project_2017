my opinion is that , there will be less cars in use than there are today , in twenty years later .i will explain these with three support reasons .first of all , the new transport can be created .our life is rapidly improving by technology development .there will be a car which fly the sky , or immidiate moving vehicles from one place to another in one second .this new technology make people not to use a car because it will require less energy to operate and it will be convenient , and faster than today s car .secondly , people use public transport rather than their own cars .every year , people who are using public transport such as buses , trains and subway is increasing .as the statistics , the reason why they take public vehicles are it takes less money , less time and convenient .if they have own car , it cost much money to filling petrol , parking fees , taxes , car insurance and fixing the car .as well as , the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing .also , there are terrible traffic jams every morning .this is a reason why people use public transport rather than own car .this will make less cars than today in the futhure .lastly , people are thinking about environment .everybody knows that car pollutes air .now a days , pollution is a big issue .this harms plants , animals and also humans .so , people are trying to reduce the pollution .so , people try to use public transport .in conclusion , my opinion is that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because our technology make new vehicle , people prefer to use public transpopt and people are thinking about environment .
