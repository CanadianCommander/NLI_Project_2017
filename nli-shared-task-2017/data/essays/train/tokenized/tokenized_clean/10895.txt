some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i personally believe that is is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because these are the neccessary sources to understand how a fact occurs and ideas and concepts are neccessary to develop and discover new facts and its consequences .first , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts because ideas and concepts are the neccessary sources to understand how the facts occur .when you see a fact occur you only see what happened but you do not know what is the cientific explanaition for this fact .for instance , if you have seen a stone falling down from the top floor of a building you know that when you throught a stone from a high place , the stone falls down , but you do not why what phisical aspects caused it .furtheremore , when you know how a fact occurs you understand better the consequences of this fact and you will be able to pronosticate the result of some fact .for example , if you know why window crash when you throught a stone to it , you will be able to know that is it not good to throught stones into windows because they crashes .hence , to understand the concepts and ideas that make the facts happend is better that to know only the result of some act .second , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead facts because they are neccessary to develop and discover new concequences of certain acts .when you know how make something you would be in possibility to investigate more about this phenomenom and attempt to prove a diferent way to make it in oder to see if the result change .for instance , if you know why fire on , then you will try to discover other ways to make fire using another materials never used .moreover , when nyou know why a fact occurs , you will also know how avoid that a fact occurs .for example , if you know that driving drunk could produce an accident , obviously you do not drive drunk anymore .therefore , to know how the facts occur is very important for life .to sum up , i am strongly conviced that understand the ideas and concepts that make that a fact occurs is better and usefull that only know a fact as a consequence from one or more acts .in my case , always try to know how and why a fact occurs in order to understand the main ideas from such phenomenom .after all , life is a several kinds of facts and you must konw them
