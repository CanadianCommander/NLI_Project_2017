the issue whether the students understand ideas and concepts is more importnat for them to learn facts is of great interests amont people .in my opinion , the students understand ideas and concepts is more important than learn facts because it is reasonable and it is the first step of learning knowledge .students can study better if they know the ideas and concepts .first of all , if the students do not know the ideas and concepts , how can they discover the new things while they are learning .students study new knowledge logically .knowing the ideas and concepts is good for their study .learning knowledge is a thing which should be step by step .second , when students study a new kind of knowledge , they have curiosity to know what is going happen in the new study .tell students the new ideas and concepts would stimulate the interests of learning .ithird , while studying students may do a lot of researches in library or on-line that will bring surprising news to students .students can use the ideas and concepts which they just learned to solve the new problem .this method can develop students  spirit of exploration .in summary , i prefer understand ideas and concepts to learn fact .understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learn facts .
