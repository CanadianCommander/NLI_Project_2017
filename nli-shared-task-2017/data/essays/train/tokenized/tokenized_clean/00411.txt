the world toll us through the history that is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts , but more important is to learn facts ..sometimes people think because they understand ideas and concepts they will reach the fame .in the college you can see a lot of students that always get the higher grades - understanding the ideas and concepts - but at the moment when they graduate and have to find a job they do nt reach the fame .these peoples do nt makes companies , because they follow the ideas of make only some money and start to work to people like bill gates , donald trump or google s companies , people who make himself big because learn to facts .when we were kids , our parents a lot of time toll us what things we should nt do , and we can have clearly the concept and the idea - like we should nt touch the fire because is hot - but when you really learn this things is when you learn to fact , like when you feel the fire or when you see a house on fire .in the history there are a lot of interesting case that toll us that is more important to learn facts that to understand ideas .one of this , is the case of a men called albert einstein .this person was nt really good in school , he always got bad grades , but in his house , he was learning to facts , doing things by himself .after years of learn to facts , albert got a conclusion of an important theory , and one day einstein won the nobel s award .in conclusion , you have to understand ideas and concepts , because this is going to be important for your life , but more important is learn to facts , is that you go out and see all the world and try everything , and this will be very good for you .
