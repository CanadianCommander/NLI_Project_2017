i totally disagree with the given statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in many subject for many reasons .because in that case one loses his interest about one particular subject , loses his mastery skills , and worst of all he wo nt get a good position in his job .to start with , one has to develop interest to get a good hold about a subject but when the student has to do mastery in all his subject than it puts extra demand on his mental as well as physical status .this in turn consumes all his energy and then make him more lethargic towards his field .sooner he will lose interst and won , t concentrate in studies .this can affect the grades .secondly i strongly believe that a student ca nt get mastery on all subjects .ther are some limitation on all human beings , in terms of cognitive abilities , the memory and learning part .it will be very rude on our part to strain the student with so much of difficult task .we can always adapt to something simpler and make life more beautiful .its fare enough to be master of one subject .the third and the most important arguement is if a student has not done specialization in one particular subject then he may lose the oppurtunity of getting a good job because nowadays businesses look for skilled individual .that will be a great loss on his monetary part which indeed is an important commodity .after all we all study to earn good money for ourself and our family and make a bright future .however , one can not deny the good side of this issue , that is one may sound fool when a person don , t have a good background about a particular issue other than is special subject , especially in a friend circle or while teaching lessons to the student but i feel that the advantages of mastery outweighs the drawbacks .so i believe its good to do mastery than gaining knowledge of everything as i don , t like to be jack of all and master of none .i don , t want to lose interest and neither a good job .
