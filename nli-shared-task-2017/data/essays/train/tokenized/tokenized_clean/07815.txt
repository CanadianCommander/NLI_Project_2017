some people think that the more important thing for students is to understand ideas and concepts ; other people think that the more important thing for them is to learn facts .both ways are very important , but i prefer to lean facts .there are three reasons .first of all , learning facts is basic of study .for examle , when i was high school student , i had a history class .this class s purpose is learning historical facts , not ideas and concepts .second , students can get the specific while they are learning facts .for instance , in math class , students are supposed to learn formulars .this is the facts .finally , learning facts is to understand the truth .in other words , facts never tell a lie .however , if students understand ideas and concepts , it has possibilities for them to misunderstand .for example , everybody has own idea and concept even though they are correct or not .if these ideas and concepts are correct , they make senses and have no ploblems in their lives .however , if they are wrong , they do not makes senses and have a lot of troubles .in order to prevent that , student should study facts , not ideas and concepts .i do not mention that it is not important for students to understand ideas and concepts .at the same time , i do not mention that it is important for them to learn facts only .as i stated , both ways are very important for students , especially young students .in japan , a lot of schools such as a elementary school , a junior high school , and a high school , teach their students facts .however , a lot of universties teach thier students ideas and concepts because they are not young .in addition , they have abilities to understand ideas and concepts .in conclusion , it is more important for students to learn facts because they need foundamentals of study , especially young students .
