i completely agree with the statement .i really think that something has to change .i mean , there are a lot of cars on the streets every day and people is always buying new cars .somethimg has to change otherwise there will not be enought space for people !having cars has its problems .pollution firs of all .all the cities has to fight against the smog and the gases that damage the enviroment .they are trying to encourage citizens not to use their cars .and what about the petrol ?the petrol nowadays is quite expensive and the resouses are not endless .talking about driving a car , we can understand easily that too many vehicles make long queues and a lot of traffic on the streets .this means a considerable waste of time .cars also need places to be parked , thus a lot of space is reqiured .that is why i think that something has to change , and that in the future people will prefer to use public transports in order to avoid all these proplems .but i also think that people are becoming more and more aware of all the services that the internet can offer .i mean that a lot a person now prefers to work at home using the computer and communicate by e mails rather than driving to the office .and this way of working is becoming always more common .the possibility of buying good on internet has the same effect .people can do shopping staying at home .they do not have to go out , stay in lines , drive to the shops or to the markets .those are all the reasons that make me belive that in the next century we will have less cars than today .i can not stand the traffic anymore .i hope i will get a job that allows me to stay at home .i will buy foods on the internet and i will move from a place to another by buses , that in my town are very numerous .i do not need a car !and i think that lots of people will follow my example , also because is a good way to safe money and time .
