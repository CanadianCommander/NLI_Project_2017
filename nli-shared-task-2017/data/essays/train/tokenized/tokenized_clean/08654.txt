in order to gain an opinion on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , i would have to first observe typical activities of both age groups .i would then have to come up with a system to measure enjoyment .the latter i am not capable of incorporating in such a short format , so that i am going to analize typical activities and - where appropriate - associate a value with them .what do young people like to do ?they travel , they like to consume fashion and music , they study and they do sports - and very often all at the same time .they certainly have the physical abilities to do so .not quite as often do they have the funding .if indeed they do nt , they like to spend big portions of their time in front of the television or computer , watching shows , surfing the internet or playing video games .often , these media represent a world , that these people would enjoy even more than their own lives .if young people do not do , what they `` like  to do , they are usually too busy to enjoy life .older people are not busy .they have time and money to travel , enjoy culture , and do sports .but all of that they can only do , if they are still healthy and active enough .otherwise they like to fall into patterns similar to the ones described do .often , these patterns involve tv or crossword-puzzles .by sarcastically creating prototypes of young and older people , i am expressing an opinion that is beyond agreement or disagreement with the opening statement .none of the groups enjoys life more than the other .it all depends on the individuals and what they make out of their living situation .
