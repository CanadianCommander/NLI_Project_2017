well i think that i also thought that at once , but now i realize that young and old people can enjoy the life the same way .a lot of people think that young people can enjoy the life better because they are more healthier and also they have no problems that make them angry or worried .without problems they think they can only think in the pleasures of the life but that s not true .for young people there are other kind of problems that for them are really big , but when you get older you realize that those problems was nt that important .old people say that is better when you are younger because for example you are not married or have childrens .with a family you ca nt take a lot of travels or things like that bacause you must stay at home with your children and do things like send them to school work for them and your husband , etc .instead when you re young you do nt have to do any of those things and only think of living your life and enjoy it .in another hand i think in another big example .my mom .yes my mom get married when she was only eighteen and that year she have my brother and two years later she have me .she does nt spend time on her and actually she did nt live her youth .but now that my brother and me are in the university she can redo her live and do things that she always want to .for example she loves to go out and hang out with her friend and family .one of the things that she always want to do was go to europe and now she did it .well , with this little example i can show other people that older people canenjoy their lives too just like we , young people , do .
