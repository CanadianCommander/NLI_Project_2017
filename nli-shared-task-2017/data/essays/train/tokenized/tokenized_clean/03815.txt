i disagree with the statement .i believe that it is better to specialize in an area that to be familiar to a whole lot of academic subjects .my response is based on an experience that speeks for itself .being from an engineering background i was faced with a similar situation where i needed to choose between a spealized course of information technology ( it ) and a general stream of computer science which also includes it .i would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide range of areas .so i took it .now i can proudly say that i specialize in it n get a brilliant job rather than saying that i know about many areas n settle for an average job .similar case where doctors after doing mbbs have to specilize in a stream to be successful .suppose a person is just mbbs .he knows about every part of the body but doesnot know how to handle a patient who urgently needs a heart surgery .this again puts light on the topic where specializing counts a lot .in this specific case it could mean life or death for the patient .when a person is good at a certain area he/she can persue a career in that stream .everyone has likes and dislikes for subjects .no one can say that he/she likes all areas of the academic curriculum .thus the person must persue the area which they are most interested in and specialize in it .this will not only make him/her happy but also keep others happy .and the person is most likely to do well by studying something they are keen on .on the other hand the person who is jack of all trades is most likely to be unhappy n make people around him unhappy by not being good at what he/she is doing .thus we can clearly conclude that it is better to specialize than to have broad knowledge about academic subjects .
