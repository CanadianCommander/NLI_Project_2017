in our consumptive society , advertising is a mean used by firms to sell their products .that is why they may sometimes made their products seem much better than they really are , but consumers have to be responsible . .in fact , advertisement is the way to inform consumers about a new product .however , firms aim at making benefits and so , at selling most of their products .they use advertising as a way to sell them .that is why their products are embodied by glamourous and beautiful people .if we think a little about it , we can sell an ordinary product , whereas our concurrent same product is said to be miraculous or exceptionnal .for example , if we are the president of loreal , we will not say that our make-up is just a good product , but we will hire julia roberts to represent our brain and to say that she can not live without it .that is how advertising works .however , we live in this consumptive society , for many years now and we are accustomed to these strategies .all consumers know that they do not often buy a real phenomenal product and they have to be careful on these advertisements and not to believe everything told .children and specially teenagers have to become aware of these dangers , or they will quickly spend all of their money .many associations have been founded in france and in other countries to fight against advertising .they act in writting on all the advertisements located in the metropolitan .nobody knows how many they are , but they aim at stopping advertisment expansion .to conclude , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but consumers also have to be stronger than advertising power .advertising is known for this particularity and we ca nt stop people to believe in this lies .
