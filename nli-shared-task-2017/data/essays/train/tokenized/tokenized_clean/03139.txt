if you ask me most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are !contemporary commercials are perfectly influencing a products success by connecting emotions , wishes and promises on the product .often the fame of celebrities or important events is used to enhance the products image .and as a third point many promoted features you often don  t need in daily use .to connect products with emotions and promises could be as old as the history advertisment itself .people are encouraged to buy a product because of these emotions and suggestions .a commercial suggestivly promises you .if you buy this kind of vodka you  ll becpome invited for important parties and will meet beatiful people .advertisment promises that you  ll be happy when you purchase .celebrities often promote products and brands become `` prime  sponsors of for instance sports events .people tend to connect these products to the famous properties of the celebrity or the event .typically brands try to find their clientel by choosing the appropriate sportsman or event to sponsor .very often many promoted features don  t be needed in real life .the so called innovative shaver by new technology basically makes the same job as an older one and the amazing highspeed or acceleration of a new sports car can  t be driven because of the speed limits .altogether according to me successful advertisment has to heighten a products image because of the hard competition among many similar products of the selling market .furthermore the companies have to attract people to buy things and to refuse the old ones .first of all this is a rule of our economic society and of course there more and more things around us to being purchased .if you become a critical user and buyer you will detect all these mostly unwarranted `` heightened meanings  .
