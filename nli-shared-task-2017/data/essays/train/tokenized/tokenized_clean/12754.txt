i do not agree with this statement .this is because that helping their communities includes to spend their time to see their friends , i think .young people join a lot of events of their universities .we can not say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .actually , a lot of students spend their time to work rather than help their communities , but they have enough time to join their communities .young people can manage their schedule , so when they want to join them , they can go .there are a lot of clubs and circles they can join their communities .and also universities give students a lot of oppotunities to participate in communities .during high school and junior high school , students have a little time to help their comunities really , but it is not students  fault .that is because the government deside to the system of schools .if they had enough time , they would give time to helping their communities .after university , we are able to have a lot of time to cope with our communities .in japan , we should help our communities .we have a lot of kinds of helping , for example , to help some shops of their home towns , clean up roads , rivers , and stations .throught those kinds of experience , japanese young people are able to learn how they join their communities .and after that , they help their communities by themselves .finally , i think that all young people give enough time to helping their communities on their own way .from someones  point of view , it does not seem to be like that .but , we have enough oppotunities to help our communities , we can not avoid them .and we think that we have to that .so , i believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .
