nowadays , there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects .although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects , i prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it .first , when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic , he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth .these issues are often complex , and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable .as a result , it is possible to take position on debated issues .for instance , i have studied psychology for many years and in my country , different types of psychology are debated now .having this deep knowledge in this particular field , i can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion .also i can stand a position very strongly if i debate with someone about this issue .in addition , i think that if i know very well one subject , it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects .as everything is related , it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways .and i believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits to approach better very complex issues .for example , early this year , the governement of my country wanted to rule a law involving changes in the social system .since i had experience in this field , it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker point of view , but i also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view .i was all the more interested by the subject that i feel very involved .from this , you can understand why i prefer to build for myself a sizeable knowledge on one specific subject .owing to this , i can take position to complex issues , and consequently i get very interested in some subjects .this strong interest permits me to open my mind to new topics with a lot of curiosity .
