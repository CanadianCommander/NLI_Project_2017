at the beginning i would like to give a short definition for the three terms ideas , concepts and facts .facts as the numbers and dates behind ideas , concepts and theories .for if for example the `` theory of adverse selection  was published in 1957 by milton freeman , the facts are 1957 and milton freeman .the idea and the concept are the problem of adverse selection and the influence it has on economic problems .my definition leads me to the opinion that i am supporting the statement in some cases , for example in the field of business adminsitration , especially in marketing .for instance is the 4p concept about formulating a strategy for bringing a product into the market .to use this theory in practice , it is not important to know when and who someone established this theory .it is more important to know what the general idea is , the facts would only be a nice add on , in which nobody would be really interested .in the field of economics it is somehow different .as theoretical concepts are the results of an idea a person had , it is quite important to know when and why someone concluded his or her ideas in a theoretical concept .economical scientists often refer to each other , especially in microeconomics and macroeconomics .to understand each single theoretical concept , it is important to know when the concept was published .the author might might have included the idea of another scientists , have used the other authors theory to formulate his own theory or there has been other external influences like wars which affected his work .to conclude my statement i would say that the necessity of understanding concepts and ideas and learing the facts strongly depend on the field of study in univerity .it is a little different during high school .the target of high school is to provide a good general and basics knowledge for young people .here it is absolutely necessary to know everything , the dates and the ideas as well as the concepts to get a good general overview over the society and the development for example in history .
