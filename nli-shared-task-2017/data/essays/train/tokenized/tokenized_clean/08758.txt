i think that the most successful people in the wourld are those who keep trying new things and taking risks .i think that because of three reasons .the first reason is that this kind of people , as i think learn new things in their life because they do not give up easily ; so they always try to dicover new things and ther is a famous speech saying that people who fail will finally succeed but those who are lazy and do not try something new or give up easil will never learn .the second reason supporting my opinion is that the people who always keep trying new things have more opportunities and are more active or energetic than those who are satisfied with what they only know ; in other words the first group , for example may improve their financial situations better or they may invent something new that is very useful for our life .let us say that the first group of people are nventors and the lazy people are receivors .the third thing or reason is that the persevering people may easily adapt with new situations other than others , for example , as think , if somebody of the first group travels to another country , he will adapt as quick as he can because he likes new things in general .with regards to lazy persons , as i like to call them , i know some persons of this kind who could not stay even for a month living alone in a new country when they travelled abroad and they are always failures .what i want to confirm here is that any person who tries new thing will finally gets it passed even if the number of failures he may commit , while anyone who is lazy and does not want to learn anything new will stay where he is and , in my opinion , he is always a failure and something that is excessive to this life .
