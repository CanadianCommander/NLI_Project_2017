usually students do nt really understand why ideas and concepts are tought in schools or universities rather than facts .which of these two notions is more important ?let s weigh the pros and cons in order to have a clear opinion on this subject .i usually ask myself `` what am i doing here ?  while attending a math course .indeed like me most of the students i do nt really understand the point of learning math which is totally absract .it is always about numbers added to each others , multiplied , equations , solutions !i m not very keen on this subject but in this case i see no solution .for instance , we all know that becoming a brilliant architect or a great physician is impossible without acquiring math notions and knowledge , but how can this knowledge be useful when we do nt really understand how it can be applied on our everyday s life ?in biology for example we learn how the human body is constructed , its anatomy , its strengths and weaknesses .these scientifical facts are useful at any time !by learning biology we are able to understand the reasons of the consequences : how our brains command each and every move of our body . ..this example also applies to physics as this subject is tought by showing experimental works and displaying to the students the reasons of all the phenomenons that happen on our planet for instance .newton s falling apple lead him to discover gravity that lead to the explanation of other events .but in the end it is always about math !these eplanations can only be proved by this important science and that s the main reason why this subject must be tought , although its useless apperance which veiles one of the most important aspects of sciences .to put this in a nutshell , it appears that facts would nt exist whitout ideas and concepts as the proof of a general fact is impossible whitout demonstrating hypothesis by experiments and calculus .even if facts are closer to reality than concepts , these two topics ca nt be taken apart , they depend on each other .
