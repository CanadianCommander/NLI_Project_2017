the issue at hand is  do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ?`` .yes , i strongly agree with the above point .in today s developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product .firstly the general public or the customers who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance .advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan s and they start using that particular product .for example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality .in this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are .secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images .they are visually more appealing and attractive to look at .due to the use of multimedia technology more and more clients get attracted and buy the product instead going for their properties and long lasting nature .for example in an advertisement its shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible .so again advertisements seemed to make products much better than what they really are in real life .thirdly advertisements lead to the increase in the sales of a particular product whether it is really good or not .many companies use advertisements to increase their sales of product .their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit .furthermore many of the firms use advertisements as an intelligent weapon to show superior features in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product .so i strongly feel that advertisements enhances the product than what really it is .
