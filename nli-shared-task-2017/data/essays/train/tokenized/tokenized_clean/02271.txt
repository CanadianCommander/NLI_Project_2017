i oppose to the idea - in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today - .nowadays , there are a lot of cars running on the roads , however from one research , only 10 % of the people in the world have a car , which means we still have lots of developing conturies needing more cars .there are huge amount of possibility of developing contries , such as china and other asia contries .their economy raising speed is over 10 % per each year .if we think about the population of china , we would agree of my thought .the number is unbelivablely high number .i heard from international student from china that lots of people are working hard and want to get a nicer car .apart from the idea of that people become rich can buy more cars , cars are getting reconised as a necessary product .people have been saying that there is no more development from in a short time , and suppose that there will be no more gasolin , however , whenever there used to be new technologes invented .car s are the same cases .as the thchnical flow in the world , which the world is going to be lack of gasolin , the new style of cars will be invented , and even at the moment , we are useing the water as gasolin .on top of that , cars are called by `` adult toy  .it can be understanded cars are not that special product , which everybody can use just as a method of moving .i suppose that after twenty yesrs , children can even get drive license ,thus ,
