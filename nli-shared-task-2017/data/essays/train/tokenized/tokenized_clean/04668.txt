i do nt agree with this statement that `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .in today s fast life , as no one has time even for breakfast , and time for more competetion and hurry has come for everyone .i think there will be more need of cars in coming next twenty years , because life will become more advance than today .first , people use car for going different places such as schools , colleges , work places or any other place such as going for a trip with family or friends .going on a trip with family or friends is not possbile without car , we will not enjoy if we will not go by car .if we will go by train or any other way , i think we will not enjoy our trip more .this prove that use of car can not be stop , and it will become more and more in the coming years .and one important thing is that people are going towards luxourious life more in coming years .second , as competition is growing more and more between peoples of the same or different organization , they need to manage their time fastly and effectively so , they use cars and use of car can not be stop in the coming years .in a daily routine business people , job workers , self employed everyone needs a personal car so that they can use that on their personal level .in morning they go to their office , from office to their mettings at different places and then again return to home at late nights .these all is not possible without the use of car .overall , i think that as long as life will go on the use of car will go on on and in the coming years its use will become more .
