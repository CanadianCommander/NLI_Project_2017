the people doing the things they already know are always more successful in the society rather than the ones trying new things .there are many reasons of this success .experiance is the most important one .the most important feature of the experience is knowing about the probabilities .by the experience people can see the difficulties and problems of the situations and they can create some ways to get rid of them .and in the second time they probably get their precautions ; or if somebody comes across a problem at one time , she  he doesnt do the same thing in the next time .moreover , experienced people are always preffered in jobs .for example whe  n i want to have my hair cut , i go to an experienced hairdresser .because i know the probability of qualifications he has is higher than the inexprienced one s .this shows his succes in this job .trying to do things without experience brings trouble most of the time .because it carries risk .being inexperienced may cause destructions in every aspect of life .but experience brings maturity .
