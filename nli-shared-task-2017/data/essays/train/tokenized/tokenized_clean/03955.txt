i agree with the statement which says its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specilalize in one specific subject .i think this will give us alot of information in many things and this will support me in the situation that maybe i will in it for example , if i study maths and i want to be a teacher thats does nt mean that i dont need to study computer , maybe i have to do presentation by the computer so it s important to me to know how to learn how to use it by studing the computer subjects .also i see this will help me to deal in correct way with the things around me for example if i have information in the medical things so i can protect my self away from dieseas .having broad knoledge of many academic make me aware abaut many things such as how to deal with others or with my student in the future by studing comunication with others which is not the math subject .if i have information abaut one specific subject i ca nt do any thing with other situations which is part of the onther subject .finally i advice others to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and do not stop
