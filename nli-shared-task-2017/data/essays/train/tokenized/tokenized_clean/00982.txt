the issue of trying new things and taking risks to get success is controversial .while some people think that success can comes if they keep on doing what they are used to do , others assume that they have to deal with completely new and risky issues .according to me , the latter viewpoint is the most appropriate way to reach success .in fact i have the feeling that one has to discover some new opportunities to be on the front scene .one instance of this is the big computer compamy apple which launched the `` i-pod product  a few years ago .in fact this device was different from its competitor products .even the apple project was risky , the consumers adopted it and the sales successfully increased .in addition , success can not be met if one does not take risk .for example , in financial services company , success means important money gains which is not possible if a minimun risk is not taken .indeed , warrants provide more hopeful gains than options do but are seven times risky .finally , being successful means being the best of all competitors .one example is the formula one team that has the goal to win the world car championship .each year , is has to compete with other car brands and try new technologies such as new bumpers to improve the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle , and to invest a lot of money for which it is not sure to get a profit in return .as a conclusion , for getting success people need to try new opportunities and to take risks that can drive them to the top level situation they have ever dreamt .
