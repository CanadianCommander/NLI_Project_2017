people can choose between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .some people prefer that studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learning the academic subject of one specific subject provides narrow knowledge with people .however , i strongly prefer that studying the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because it strenthens people s exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .first of all , i prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learing environments .learing many academic subject needs a lot of time .moreover , if some academic in many academic subjects is not interesting to people , then the environment discouages people s studying ability for example , according to the study by one of the most famous professor dr. kim in republic of korea , 68.9 % of people like learing one exciting academic subject because it makes people s good studying circumstances .in this sense , i would rather that specializing in one specific subject because it strengthens people s exciting studying circumstances .in addition , i would rather studying the academic subject of one specific subject because future occupation needs professional knowledges .our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher , nurse and doctor .these occupations have a special technique to do their works .for instance , in my case , the computer programmer needs special knowledges such as coding java languages , c languages and c++ language .these knowledge can aquire efficiently only in computer science academic subject .in this sense , i would rather that learning the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .in conclusion , i definitely prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it intensifies people s exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .
