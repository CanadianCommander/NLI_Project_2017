i agree with the statement made as it is clear that people have come to understand that there have been several attempts made to reduce global pollution .the use of vehiciles has put the world on red alert as we are destroying our atmosphere day by day with emissions of harmful gases and intoxicants .we are all aware of the amount of harm we are doing to our atmosphere because most citizens would rather go from destination a to b with their privately own cars without acknowledging what we are doing to the earth itself .governments worldwide and national organizations have been concerned with the issue of pollution and how it is going to affect in the near future .several organizations have acknowledged this issue and are implementing rules restricting the use of private vehicles .there are alternative ways other than using cars , which are mainly used for transportation and rarely for recrational activity .one option is that all cars , that are owned privately , are destroyed and all citizens and inhabitants of a certain area restrict themselves to public transport such as buses .this will be of great benefit to both society and the atomshere around us .first of all it would reduce our financial problems like car payment , petroleum , services and so on .another suggestion is that the make trains , also known as metro s to be used more often which consume electricity rather than petrol .governments have stated that there would be a great drop in the number of cars purchased and the numbered currently owned , and not to include the rate of gas emissions would drop to around forty five percent in the coming years if people abide by this rule and follow it .
