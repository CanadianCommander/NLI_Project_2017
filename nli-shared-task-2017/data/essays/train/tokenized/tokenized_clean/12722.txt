different people have different opinions that the advantage of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects compare to having specialize in only one subject .i strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many subjects is more benefical for social person and solve problems efficiently .first of all , more vast knowledge allow us to be social person .although specific information render to think deeply , a lot of knowledge is more benefical to think widely .in our society , where gradually increase piece of information because of internet , haves and not haves of infomarion has a considerable gap .at this time , wide infomation is more essencial requirement for living in society .for example , when i was watch the program of olympic game every 4years , i need to absorb about the role of each game to totally understand whether win or not .morever , when face social issues such as green house , we should have a information several subjects such as the aspect of social , knowledge of science and the law of world for talking with others about them .this shows that if we do not want to be isolated person , we should have broad knowledge .next , broad knowledge of academic subjets is necessary for solving problems efficiently .when people have a problem whatever faced in life , they need to solve that for using many information .for example , when my parent were having a problem with sell a house , they had to gather many knowledge such as economic , law and enviroment .they wants to get a money by selling a house , so they had to consider to economical aspect in society .moreover , they wished to reduce tax , that is why they should to learn about law .they also consdiered region of new house which they will transfer for more convenient life .in conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more better .
