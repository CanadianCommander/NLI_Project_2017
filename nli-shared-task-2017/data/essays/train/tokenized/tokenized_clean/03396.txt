i do nt think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , it is only a different way of enjoying theirselves and to perceive emotions .in my opinion there is more consciousness in the way in which older people try to enjoy and get the best from life , because they have lived a whole life and they really know what is important and what is not .they know , for example , that reading is more important than watching a blockbuster movie or than having a car race .young people waste a lot of time doing things that seems important to tham but which after a couple of years would have lost their meaning .furthermore young people often try to have fun doing dangerous sports or things .for instance , older people are used to visit art cities and to chose quiter locations for their holidays .this is not a sign of luck of will to appreciate life , not at all , it demonstrate only older people s capacity to live without all modern stuff which seem to be central and crucial in young people s life , as tv , music , disco , noise , crowded places , videogames , and so on , and to appreciate nature and historycal backgrounds .furthermore young peple s way to have fun is often superficial and selfish .they spend a lot of time doing things as watching tv or playing videogames which both are activities which do nt stimolate their skills and abilities .these are also activitiese that do nt encourage guys to gather together , on the contrary they meke young people more and more lonely .
