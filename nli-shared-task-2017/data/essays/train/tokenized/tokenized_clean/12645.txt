i like to see advertisements , especially on tv .there is a variety of advertisements ( i.e. , tv commorcials ) .some advertisements look like a tv drama ; some advertisements look as if it thretes us to buy it .it is the company selling podusts who produces the advertisments for the products .there is almost no exception on the fact , i think .thus , i personally agree with this statements .need less to say , advertisments are made in order to encourage consumers to buy products .there is no wonder that a company trys to show its product better as much as possible .i believe that it introduce its produt better than real .when i was a child , i watched advertisement for an air plane toy .in the advertisement , i was the plane flying the air .at that time , i was so impressed and asked my paretent to buy me .my further bought me it one day .however , i was so disapointed with the plaine , since it did not fly ! .my further also was dissapointed at seeing me being sisapointed .i have never trust advertisements since then .recently , i enjoy advertisements as a kind of fiction of products .i believe that advertisement is a kind of presentation to express what product a compaly wish to make .thus , i agree with the statements .
