i do not agree with this statement .opposing , there will be even more cars than there are today .people are more and more interested in status symbols ; therefore , they want bigger and better cars .this is not only represented by the huge variety of possibilities we have to buy a car nowadays : we can hand in our old car and pay less for the new car bought at the same firm ; we can buy cars only used for exhibitions a lot cheaper than they would have been normally ; we are able to lease cars and even if someone is not a doctor , he might well be able to drive a new mercedes .due to this importance of luxury goods , people demand for better things .the car industry is already making use of this because i have never seen as much advertisement for cars as i do at the moment .they advertise on posters on the street , in magazins , in the cinema , and the car industry seems to become bigger and bigger rather than smaller .as we all know , cars pollute the environment .i live in frankfurt and i remember those electronic boards put up on big streets in the city center where people are asked to refer more to puplic transfers .on the other hand , and i can only speak for myself , it is just more convenient to drive my own car , listen to my own music and drive at my own speed ; so i will definitely not be using more public transfers in the nearer future .considering my point of view , i am very sure that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
