i m absolutely agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .travel in a group can solve the problem of boring because you can talk to people who share the commom interests as you are .furthermore , travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especilly to those chaotic areas in the destination .and travel in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous places and worth seeing sceneries .because guide is a person know the place well and he know at which sesason , at what time , where is beautiful and he also can lead tourists to visit avoid the peak time which is very convient for tourists .then , travel in a group can make a lot friends during the vacation and can enhance the relationships .our human beings are not isolated ones , we need to communicate .and in the modern society , whatever organizations or bussiness companies oe even universities all require people have the abilities to work or study as a group .i had an experience which was impressive .when i was a junior high school student , my teacher asked us to draw a pitcure which we though is the most beautiful one .so we began to draw seperately without disscusion .after a while , each students showed their pitcures which all presented very pale in meaning except one which combine the work of two students and which showed a more meaningful and more various color in it .yes , the teacher wanted us to know sometimes work with our partner and shared both valuable things would attribute a amzing result which maybe could not predict .if travel in a group , we can exercise the ability to be more cooperative and willing to help each other which will make our society more colouful and more competitive in the long run .i highly recommend to travel in a gruop led by a tour guide .
