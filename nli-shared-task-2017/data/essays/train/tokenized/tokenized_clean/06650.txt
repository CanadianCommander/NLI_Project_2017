youth can but does nt know , elderness knows but ca nt any more .that the way i would answer this question .in my mind , when you are young you can enjoy the simple fact of being alive and having the whole life in front of you .young people are unaware of the miseries that goes along with living .for sure , health and hope help for enjoying life , but when you do nt know yet where is real happiness , you just waste your time .older people maybe have another way of being happy and enjoying life that may not be worst : they know what they have done , and hopefully get ideas of what they still can do .most of the time , older people have more material wells than young ones and the satisfaction of a well managed past life can keep an elder being happy , with his family , the house he built , or the society he helped to carry on .moreover , this state of things allows them to know that they will do pass . ..so , why not to do what you have ever wanted to do ?older people know that their time is to come , and regarding this , get pride of what they done before .the reason why older people may enjoy life less than younger ones comes from the fact that they sometimes just live not to die , whereas young ones just live to be happy .youth is for fighting , building and lust for life , elderness is for being in peace , getting benefits of what you done hardly when you had the strength to do it .or that the way it should be .in the end , i would say that it s easier to enjoy life when you are young , but elder way of enjoying life is much more true and deep .
