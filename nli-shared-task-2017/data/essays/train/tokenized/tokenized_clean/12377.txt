i am 22 years old now , that means i should be included to the `` young people  used in the statement .that makes me think how my life is going .i ask this question to myself .and my answer is to agree with the statement .i think young people , including me , do not or can not give enough time to helping their communities .i will show my points in the following .the question asks using `` young people nowadays  in the statement , therefore , i should compare the young people in the old time with of them in nowadays particulary in the stiation of their families .i study in the university 4 times a week and i work at the restrant in nearby 3 times a week constantly .moreover , i study english for the graduate school everyday .that shows that i can not have enough time to helping my family because i am too busy to do it .but tipically in japan , women did not go to university to help their family and to learn how to be as a housewives .the enviroment that both young poeple in old time and nowadays has changed .it became giving chances to women to do what they want , on the other hand women became much more busy and lost enough time to help own families .i think there should be enough time for young people to helping their communities , though it seems difficult for me .to make it possible , not only young people but also all of the members of the communities have to help each other .
