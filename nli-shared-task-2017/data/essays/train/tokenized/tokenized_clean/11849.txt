marketers are facing an increasing competition .as they do not want to see their market share decrease , they need to find more effective ways to sell their products .that is why i really think that marketers develop techniques to make their products seem much better than they are .i have noticed several of these techniques in various markets .first , most of the products are shown in a nice environment that has nothing to do with them .for example , most advertisements for clothes show a model in a nice place like a beach or a nice restaurant .the overall impression is very good even if the product is not great .second , photography technologies enable the product to look better .for example , small objects are shot closely in order to make it appear much bigger .i have noticed that it is a common practice for people that are selling rings with diamonts .another way to embelish a product is to add creative copy to a product image .some advertisements are misleading the consumer .they give partial information .i often see advertisements for computer batteries .most of the time , the lifetime of the battery is not really communicated .instead , the copy says ` long lifetime  .it could be two years or six months .in conclusion , i think that advertisers are using techniques that are often misleading .it is very important to look precisely at an advertisement in order to get a real sense of what the product really is .
