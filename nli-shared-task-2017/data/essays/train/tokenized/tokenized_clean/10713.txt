`the sound of a fat woman is much better when she is far away .` i totally agree that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are .it is like pandora s box , it looks wonderful but you do nt know what you will be face with .however there are some reasons why it works this way .first of all , there are so many competitions in the advertisement world .if i was one of them i had to do something which would get the visual attraction initially .for instance , most of us can remember the quisnos sandwich advertisement .it is not only exhibits the product but also compares it with the other items .it is full of collars so when ever i am doing something different , it distracts me and even though i have watched it almost hundred times i ca nt help myself to turn around and stare .it does nt mean that they make the best sandwiches but they do well in advertising .second , as we live in the changing world so rapidly , the advertisements must be easy to recognize .not only they have so many other options to be displaced but also they should be easy to be recognized .when i go to a supermarket i see a lot of products and most of them does nt have any match in my mind .what i really do is , to go to the aisle and pick up the one that i can remember .because they make it look better than the others .besides , if the advertisement exactly say what it is , i am one hundred percent sure that they will become less attractive .think of a sandwich , it would be so bad if the person eating that sandwich in the advertisement , had done something as he actually had thought that it was disgusting .as a conclusion , it may not be the ethical way to advertise the product but as long as it gets the attention and easily recognizable , that is appropriate in this world we are living .
