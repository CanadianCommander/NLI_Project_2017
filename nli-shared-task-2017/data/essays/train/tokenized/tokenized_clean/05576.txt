understanding and learning are not able to be separated because withouht understanding learning can not happen and without learning understanding can not happen as well .however , there are orders of between understanding and learning .in my opinion , understanding is more important than learnign because for me , learing means understading facts because without understanding , i can not learn any of facts that i should learn .the three reasons that i think understanding is more important than learning are without understanding , learning can not happen , without understanding , people are easily lost what they are learning and just learning can help people for a moment but as time goes by , most people do nt remember what they learned .these are the my reasons that understanding ideas and concepets are more important than learning factors .my first view point is without understanding , learning can not happen .for example , when i came to canada fist time , i learned about canada s history and at that time , i could nt understand any of them because i just tried to memorize bunch of factors and l believd that was the way to learn factors .it was wrong .after i understood the flow of history , i was able to understand canada s history .with just memorizing or learning some facts from somewhere or someone are impossilbe that people let know about the facts , understading is obviously needed .in additiotn , wihtout understanding ideas and concepts , people are usually lost what they are learning .one of my friend did nt know how to solve math problems because he just tried to put several numbers in to the formula that he learned from his teacher .when he understood why and how the problem could be solved , he was possible to learn about math more .if he could nt understand the concepts and idead of math , he would not learn about math anymore .the last reason that people should understand first is as time goes by , people often forget what they learned .most korean people do nt remeber what they learned at high schools because they just learned without understanding .they needed to get into good universities so they learned a lot without understaning the concepts or ideas .they usually said it was useless .however , they do remember most of history .they absoletly learned history but before learning history , most koreans understood what lettes they are using and where they are living .not only koreans remember their history , but also other countries  people remember most of history of their mother country .they understood why and how they are living through understanding and life .learning facts can help people at a moment but it does nt mean they do understand what they are learning .before learning something , we should understand ideas and concepts for effective learning .
