look around and you will see that we live in a very luxurious time .there are more than one car for each appartment , the parking lots are full and the tracfic is crowded with cars which has no one inside but driver .enjoy these times because there will be fewer cars in use than there are today with in twenty years .first of all there will be governmental laws which will limit the number of cars allowed in the city .because awereness of environmental hazards that is caused by cars are increasing .altough there are products like bio-oil and exhaust filters , which decreases the demage , increasing number of car usage outlaws this decrease .actually there is already an application for this .for instance my father , having a car with stronger engine pays much more money tha i do .because a stronger engine will cause more demage to environment .secondly , petrolium prices will go up to a point where only upper class people can effort it .the reaon is simple : petrolium reserves will be diminished .there are reports indicating that todays reserves will last only about fifteen to twenty years .also , last years price increase clearly illusturate this phenomenon .now i have to pay twice as much many as i did in the begining of the year to fill the car .there are atempts to make cars work on different sources of energy such as hydrogen , electricity , sun light , etc but they are unlikely to enter the market any time soon .in conclusion unless we can not find ways to make cars non-hazrdous to environments and work on other sources of energy , the number of cars will likely to decrease with in twenty years due to envorinmental and aconomical issues .
