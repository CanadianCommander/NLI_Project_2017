i do nt agree that s true .young people are just trying to enjoy their lives .they can not enjoy their lives easily .they olny enjoy a little in their freetime .there are a few reasons why they do nt enjoy good enough .first , they have a lot to do .they have to study more and more .they have to go school for their future .if they do nt study , they ca nt get the garranty for the future .a lot of new knowlodge come up to the world everyday .if they want to win the compititions , they have to study more and more .that s the way to survive .second , they do not have enough money to enjoy .in generally when they want to do something fun , they need money .if they travel their country , they need money .whatever they want to do , they need money , except the part-time jobs they want .the last reason is the tons of items to enjoy .now they have a lot of things to have fun .some young poeple get confused among them .they do not even know what and how to enjoy .the floods of things to enjoy can make them hesitate what to choose .if so , can older people enjoy their lives well ?my answer is `` yes  there are some reasons to say that .first , older people have enough time to enjoy .if they retire from their jobs , they can do .they do not spend their pretty much time to prepare fot the future .they can just only enjoy their lives .second , they have money .when they retire , they get some money from their company , or they can recieve money even from reverse mortagage .in conclusion , older people can enjoy their lives more comforble and easily than young people .
