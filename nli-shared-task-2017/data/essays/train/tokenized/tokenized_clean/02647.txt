yes i agree with following statements .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .as life is a short period so the student cant experience or learn every thing in facts .when coming to understanding the ideas and coccepts it one of the life cycle for the student .as student faces many kind of ideas and concepts in class while listening to the class .student comes to know many kinds of concepts while reading a book or listening to the lecture in the class .the student is supposed to create ideas while reading books .understanding the ideas of other people like class mates or friends is very important in the student life , because many people have many ideas and concepts .by understanding the ideas of other people the student can learn many things related to life and survive ni his life at any stage with out facing any problems .if the student fails in catching the ideas and concepts of other people he will face many problemsin life .some people has the ideas of solving any kind of problem by their ideas and concepts which he faced regularly in his life .by having ideas on a perticular job which has to finish by the student he can survive and completes the job at any kind of difficulties he faces in the path of completing the job .for example the students prepares for a seminar and prepared a paper work for the seminar .but he losts the information prepared by him .but he is not discouraged and the ideas and the concepts he prepared encourages him to complete the task in time .this is the main advantage for the students to understant the ideas and concepts than to leatn facts .favts can be learned by the experiences faced by the students in his life .every thing in the life cant be experienced as stated below .as there is no experience for the student in facing the seminar but he completes it perfectle with the ideas and concepts .for this reason iagree with the above statement
