in my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subjects .it means to belong general culture that could be used in a day-life time .it means you can speak and keep a conversation on differrent variety of topics with a lot of people , even if some of them are not belonging to your class or to your culture or religion .even to find a position on the job market is easier because you are not connected to specific competence areas .in example i can mention the profession of the doctor and the dentist s one .both have kind of preparation about medical notions and acknowledge of the human anatomy , but the doctor can choose his specialization after the study .before , he gathered many information about all the subjects of linked to the human body and then he will focus his choice to work in surgery , radiology , gynecology or any other department .dentist knows from the very beginning what will be work on and their studies are focused on specific subjects regarding the mouth .and they will work as dentist , no other choice .you are tied up to the formation you have received .on other hand , having a specialized knowledge of one subject allows them to be much more professional in shorter time .and probably to reach the goal before the others .but in a world where every company has the need to get different his production , probably they will require a feature of suitability in the mind of their employee .passing through a department to another one with different tasks requires an elastic mind and could help you to better understand the interconnected problems between the production areas .to conclude i would like to support my opinion with a strange personal example .i am a n average player of many sports : tennis , volleyball , football , swimming and many oter else .i am not a pro in anyone of them but i can continuously choose friends to play with .never saying , sorry : i ca nt join you because i am not able .
