the fact that most concepts and ideas lead to a fact make me agree with the previous statement .when i was a child , most of the facts were explained to me as : `` that is the way it is  .that is why i saw the world very big at that time .growing up through years to reach this level , knowing so many things make me wondering about that saying .actually from my study in the university , i found that most the facts that were not explained by thier concept are strange thing .we usually start with ideas and conceots to reach such fact that no one can say it is wrong or there is an adoubt about it .for our brains , the facts that we can not explin is not worth to think about .this thing is invalid for ginous pepole .an example of what i wrote so far , if we consider the earth with its circular shape came from the believe that we can cross the world from east to west .but know one can explain why the people in the sothern region of the earth do not feel that they up side down .this example shows how ideas and concepts will yeild to facts and how facts sometimes can not be explained .finally , when the studet concentrate on the ideas and concepts he will learn the ability how to match the facts togather .on the other hand , if the student focus on the learning the facts he will learn the ability to memorize the events which is not a character of this generation good learning .a match between them will be better although i consisit that knowing ideas are more useful than learning facts .
