happiness and enjoyment is a perception and has no relation with age .i donot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .when a man is young , he has to make a career and has a lot of responsibilities on his shoulders .though he is more physically active , but he may not have the resources to enjoy the way he wants .his social and personal obligations would keep him occupied all the time .on the other hand a person who has the time and resources and has got the maturity to understand his needs , can live a happier life .he knows what would give him pleasure and would not merely experiment with things .he knows the value of time and money and would utilize it more effeciently .enjoyment is not just going to night clubs or do adventure sports .a person can enjoy a stroll in th park or a sun tan on the beach .but for enjoyment you need a relaxed mind .a mind free of tensions and anxieties .i see more older men , who have achieved their goals enjoying life than their younger counterparts .i went for a cruise this year end with my parents and girlfrend .there were people from all walks of life and different generations on the ship .people were enjoying their heart out but to my surprise it was the older people who were looking happier .there was a newly married couple who were on their honeymoon and had a room next to me .i could listen to their fights every night .there was another couple who didnot have much time to talk as the guy was always busy on his laptop and the cellphone .majority of the young people did not look happy and satisfied .they had goals to be achieved .they didnot have time to sit back and enjoy their accomplishments .they had worries which could not leave them even on a vacation .a person who can not maintain a balance between his personal and professional life can not enjoy life .therefore , i feel an older person can enjoy life more than a young person does .
