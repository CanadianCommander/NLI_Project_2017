i agree with the following statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more better than having specialize in one specific subject .i am a japanese high school student .i am studing various subject in my school .it is too hard for me to understand all of these , but studing a lot of subject is very interesting and i can feel happy when i understand the something new .so , i stronglly feel we should study and get broad knowledges from many academic subjects .then i would like to explain more detail .these day , there are many enviromental problems around the world .for example , grobal warming , water pollution , air pollution , many rain forests are destoloed , and rubbish problems .i think these problems are not solve with a single subject knowledge , so scientists in the world should share their opinions and results of study with other field of masser s scientist to solve these problems more better .if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we could think about many things , and we could get abilities something new .
