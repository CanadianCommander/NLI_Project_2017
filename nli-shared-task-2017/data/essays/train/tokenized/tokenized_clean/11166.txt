i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are several reasons to prove this opinion .first , students understand and learn easily about the subject if they know what ideas and concepts are .for example , in math class , they are learning about the multiplication formula .at the basic level , they only memorize the formula .four times four equals to sixteen .this is not difficult , but in problem solving quetions , they need to think about the quetion what formula they are going to use .at this point , they need the skill derived from the main concept and idea about the multiplying system .second , if they just learn the facts , they only need to memorize the facts that happened in a specific time range .they can not apply the fact into real life .in real life , people confront many unexpected moments .they should be wise to solve problems when they are in difficult situation .however , if people only learn the facts , how can they solve other problems that they have never experienced ?therefore , people need to apply ideas and concepts that they have learned to the problems in real life .third , every subject is interacting each other .for example , math and science are related subjects and social and history are related subjects .people would not know how they are related and study well both subjects if they do nt know the concepts and ideas of each subject .everything that surrounds people in their lives are related and interacting each other .people study subjects that are related our surroundings .if they only know the facts , they can not be improved and go ahead because they have only limited knowledge and skills .to think broad and fix the problems , people have to know the real idea they have to achieve and the main concept of the subject .
