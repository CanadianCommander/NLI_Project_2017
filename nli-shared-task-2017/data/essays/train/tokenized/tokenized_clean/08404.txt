according to what all government say , that all cars must only be transported from an country to another with in a five years of date of due from the company .every country must make a roule about controlling the number of car that is coming year after year .every new car that is made , it brings with it more pollution and more traffic to the world .the government must have a limit or a regulation to prevent the additions of cars year after a year .i think that in five or ten years they will be more fewer cars then there is now , but i do nt think that after twenty years they will be more .because technology will prevent it and they will stop using cars .they will use new technolgy rather then cars that bring us problems like pollution , car accidents , more traffics , death penalties etc . ..in the newer world they will find a solution for it , because if not it will be a catastrophe and a disaster .because logically world is not gonna get bigger in twenty years but cars are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain .i think technology will take place in twenty years from now , it might use plane besides cars or huge escalators through buildings , maybe even escalators underground .no one knows what is in the future or what is waiting for us then .life is much harder then we think we ca nt just imagine it with in a few words it much more complicated .i hope for the best in our future life for all whom gonna participate in it. , and i hope that tecnology will prevent the catastrophy probelm of cars and stop it from growing into the world and multiplying by billions .of countity .everyone looks for his best and goods .life is life .
