cities twenty years laterhow will our cities be in the future ?how will people live twenty years from now ?these are questions asked for so many years and we can see many different answers , theories and approaches through out history .when trying to answer these questions , the key aspects of cities such as traffic and car use come into the picture .i believe that , in terms on car use in the city , there will not be significant decrease in the number of cars used and even more cars will be used in twenty years .there are several aspects effecting the car use today .the main element is the car-dependent life style of modern people living in the cities .i believe that the city life of the near future will as car dependant as today or even more .cities evolve and continue to get bigger counting on the mobility of the people .as new suburbs are created and cities with multiple city centers away from each other , are developed ; as the current situation in istanbul nowadays more and more people will need to use cars .the only reason for fewer cars to be used in the near future would be the concept of working from home using the internet .people can argue that when people will have the chance to live and work in one place - the home office concept , they will not need to use cars .however the concept of a home ofiice is not that new and in the past 10 or 15 years many people tried to work from home but ended up going back to their offices .big companies are not supporting people working from home , on the contrary they are trying to create better and more confortable working environments in and around the city .based on what i see in my own country ( turkey ) and many other developing countries i can say that more and a lot of money is invested in the car industry , highways , tunnels and bridges making it easier and necessary for people to use cars .therefore i believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
