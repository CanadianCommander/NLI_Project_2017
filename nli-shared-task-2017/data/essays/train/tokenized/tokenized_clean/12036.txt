i want to go to many places which i do not know yet because the travel is fun for me .however i sometimes have bad experiences and times by a group tour and a guide .therefore i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for these reasons as follows .firstly , the group tour do not fit for me .everything such as shightseeing places or food is already decied in a group tour .then there are another ploblems .for example , i have been to germany in a group tour led by a tour guide .however it was the worst trip for me .when i went there , i was only ten years old , but all members of my group were over sixty years old .therefore i could not speak anyone .also the guide was an english woman , so i did not understand her talking because i am japanese .i could not know any english words .i knew that i could not do freely .secondly , i want to research some pleces that i visit to by myself .in a group tuor , the guid tells me much information such as the name of city or building .however i want to looking for these things because i love history in the world and the city , tokyo which i live in .if i travel alone and reaserch many things , i enjoy it very much .also i believe that i have the best experiences .all in all , the trip which is in a group led by a tour guide is not the best .if i travel with pnly personal people such as my best friends , parents or sisters , it fit for me because i can do everything freely .also i can enjoy to know a great number of informationabout tha city which i go to because my hobby .for these reasons , i disagree that the group tour led by a tour guid is the best to travel .
