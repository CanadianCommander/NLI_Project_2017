i think that those persons that try new things and take risks their have more success than those thaty only doing what they already know how to do well .one the many reasons is that people that try new things in their live is because their are looking at how to be altruist and how to be success .for instance , if i want to be a competitive person sending cars , i need to have many ideas in order to create new models and new types , more strongs , more sures , cheaper and nicer .i have to try many risks during the elaboration the this cars , i have to risk much money in employers that they be more preparated and i must give them all the necesities that the government s law requirs .if i want to be altruist , i need to take risk even though i get scare .one person who does not like to be altruist and success does not try any thing because he or she has scare and always they will be people comfortables and aphatics .by the way those persons who try take risk their will recognize in many places of the world .other instance is that if someone has a factory of shoes and has many competers , he or she needs to try new techiques and new methods to make new types in order to compete with others factories .but these factories which does not try compete with other factories , may be they are going to disappear easily and their models are going to be unusual , unlike , and uglies .for this reason you need to be compettitive person if you want to be success and if want to be someone in your live to beer famous and be recognized whe you get death
