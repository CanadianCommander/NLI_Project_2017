it is complex to clasify young people .some are really concious and helpful while other are just selfish members of society , consuming the money of their parents and wasting time .community service is now a very well recognised activity , specially by universities .that s why so many students get involved in helping others , to get points for their cv .from my point of view people who do that are really mean and unfair .it is really beatiful to say that everyone loves helping the poor and the disabled , but actually not everyone likes to spend their free time in treating this type of people .i do like going some weekends to the nearest home to help mentally insane people .my school organizes this actitivity , and i ve seen so many people who only went there to get points for the community service program .it is really deceiving to see this young people , sometimes your friends , standing there doinmg nothing and basically not helping , but disturbing your work .but apart from helping in homes and special centers , communitiy service also involves keeping clean your street , the parks you visit in your free time and helping in your particular home .with this i mean not throwing garbage everywhere ( just because you think someone is going to pick it for you ) , helping your mum to make dinner or wash the dishes after it , and so many other simple activities .young people do nt seem to be very interested in this activities either .they think their only obligations are to get home , do their homework and study ( even though many students do nt even follow this directions ) .in conclusion , generally young people , specially teenagers , do not give enough time to helping their communities .going further , the ones who actually give , are expecting somekind of benefit .only a few youngsters follow the pattern of `` good member of society  , and sadly those ones are considered the freak , instead of being encouraged .surely better education could change this common selfish attitude ; even though you can not make a silk purse out of a sours ear , and some people wont change in all their lifes .
