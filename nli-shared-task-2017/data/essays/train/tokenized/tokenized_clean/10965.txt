i strongly agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .young people enjoy a lot than older people .even older people not have patience to enjoy .the young people enjoy their work also but not the older people .as the older people are too week they are not able to go out side , even if they stay at home also as they are older they are not able to enjoy as young people .as the people become older they may get lot of health problems , if they want to enjoy also they not cause of their age .but unlike th eolder people young people enjoy a lot even in work also .for example if there is a party going in a home , let us take the older and younger people attend the party .the young people look more sharp than older people .they can dance , sing and able to participate in any program unlike older people .the young people also have so much knowledge than older people , so that they can participate actively in educational programms and they can enjoy the program .as the people become older they lost knowledge what they are earned when they are in young age , so they are not able to participate even in th eeducational programes .not only that one but also as the people becoming older they have so many tensions about their followers , their work and also about thier health , as there is no tensions for the young people nothing than the work tension .even though the young people have the work tension they can enjoy the tension also .as the people become older they loss knowledge , they loss patience , and also they are having the lot of tensions and disturbences .so the people in the young age that is young people can enjoy a lot than the older people .
