i disagree with the statement provided .because cars are the efficient transport of a man.cars are the easiest means of transport for the man today .if the man wants to lead a luxurious life he must have a car .in the modern day car has become the status symbol for a man .i dont have any sort that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today , as the population of the world is growing , we cant say that the use of cars will be less as compared now .if the usage of cars is less then what the people are going to use ?when compared to all the vehicles that are available now in the marked , the best transport that fits a family is car , which is affordable by a common man .if one has to travel from one place to another , everytime he can not afford to go by aeroplane , trains , when he is having the cheaper means of transport .if a person has a car of his own , he does nt have to rely on the public transport such as buses , trains , trucks , aeroplanes etc .though there are other means of transport one should have a own vehicle such as car .if he has a car it is useful to him at any part of the day .the needs and desires of a man suggests to have a car .a man has to face problems if he doesnot have a car .if he has to travel urgently without wasting time he has to prefer a car of a flight .the charges for the flight would be very expensive , so the man prefers to go by car .if he has to go by means of public transport , lot of time will be wasted for him as he has to go to the nearby statins early to book a ticket and he has to wait for the bus to go .so i dont agree with the above statement .hence cars are not going to be fleeting and they are the only means of transport which are going to be used by every person .hence there will be more cars than today , twenty years from now .
