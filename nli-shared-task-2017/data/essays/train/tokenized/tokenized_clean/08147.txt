i totally disagree with the statement ` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , being in my youth at the age of seventeen i trully feel my level or energy of enjoyment is way greater than that of my uncles and aunts , but this dose nt necessarily mean that people who are older do nt enjoy life .young people have different kinds of enjoyment in life , as they have a lot of vigour , passion , aggression to do something or to be someone and to enjoy life simultaneously , whereas older people have vigour , passion and aggression for other things which do nt show as they have been through all the ages , they used to enjoy life differently and now they enjoy life as they have attained most of their goals and dreams .i would like to tell you about an example , my dream is to have a house in australia for which i have to work hard , whereas people who have already achieved things are enjoying their life .there are different types of enjoying life by young people and older people , i would certainly call river raftin , trekking , playing in the snow , watching movies etc. enjoying life to the fullest , whereas my dad and mom would call cruises , going to meuseums , go for classical music concerts enjoying life .so there is a generation gap , but this dose nt mean that my parents are enjoying life lesser than i am .its not about how much you enjoy its about how you enjoy life , and that can be same for young people as well as older people .young people have the time to enjoy life , whereas older people have less time to enjoy it , but all of this depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice just to enjoy life .so at the end of the day you are just trying to enjoy life and not measure who actually enjoyed more or enjoyed less .
