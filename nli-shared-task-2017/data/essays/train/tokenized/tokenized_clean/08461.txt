i disagree with the topic .young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities .even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading .they really show up and help when the time comes for doing that .consider the example of katrina hurricane .the hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans .during that time students and other young people through out the wourld gave the helping hand .students have eshtablished many camps around the victimized areas to help the poeple .many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money .even though many of the students are busy in their college schedule , they devote some time for social sevice .many students from club in there collge for helping the under privelaged kids and others .this i am stating from my personal experienced .i am a member of rotract club in college .me along with some other students have arranged a camp in college to encouraged the under privelaged kids .we went a orphanage and brought few kids to our college and gave them training in sketching , fabric painting , clay modelling etc .we have this program once in a semester and the members of the group work for two to three days on it .even the employs many of companies do have a charity trust to help the community .these trusts or most commanly called as ngo have a lot of young members .they are more active and enthusiastic when it comes to some adventerous job helping the piligrims who visit temples which are very difficult to reach , setting up the first aid camps in such locations etc .the youth even though is getting busy with their daily routine , they are giving enough importance amd time to helping their communities .infact it is the youth which thinks less selfishly when it comes to help .they always want to show their enthusiasm in helping others .
