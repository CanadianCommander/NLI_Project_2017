i think there are some people who wishs to travel in a group led by a tour guide , especially abroad .but i do nt think it s the best way to do .i disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .there are two important points about this statement --- ` travelling in a group  and ` led by a tour guide  .first , if we travel in a group , we ca nt see things and think in our mind quietly .that also means we have to adjust the pace to walk or see things to other s .second , if we are led by a tour guide , we have to listen to his or her guide all the time .even if some of their saying is already known by us , we have to put up with hearing it .moreover , if we take part in a group tour , places to go are chosen beforehand and unchangeable in most of the cases .certainly , we may feel much more secure if we travel in a group led by a tour guide .we do nt have to worry if we feel bad or get deseases compared to the situation of travelling alone .and we can meet unknown people of touring member .also we do nt have to find a place to eat because it is decieded from the first mostly .but despite these points , i prefer traveling alone because we can go anywhere we want if we travel by ourselves .and we can enjoy many places --- including some local areas which is not popular --- that the touring seems not to go to .moreover , if we do nt have a tour guide around us , we have to check the information of the destination beforehand and plan the whole process of the travel .that makes us know much closer about that place , and enable us to have a strength to deal with things happening in unknown places .feeling secure and being comfortable are totally different .these are the reasons that i perfer travelling alone .so i disagree with the previous statement .
