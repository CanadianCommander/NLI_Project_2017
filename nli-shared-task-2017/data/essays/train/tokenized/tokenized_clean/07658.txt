nowadays people use to describe our society with quickly changing terms .a popular one is : ` the ego-society  .the theroy of writers or journalists employing this description is that especially young , urban people are very focussed on their career and benefit , not being very interested in communal activities or even in social relationships .from my experience i can say that i know many people who live this way , thinking only of their own interest .at school for example there were much fewer possible activities or clubs then in former days , because fewer and fewer students were willing to organize or conduct one .most initiatives were brought up by teachers who did not recieve much support .there are , of course many examples of socially very active juveniles who for example work in institutions for disabled people in their free time or simply organize sports clubs .i think that there is an active culture of helping others without any benefit even among young people .but still the main tendency is to leave such aparently unattractive works to others or demand pay .this developement which can be seen in many of our big cities surely has its reasons .advertisement in television keeps showing us a world , a very attractive world in which you are not much more than the sum of the things you own .young people today do not identify themselves with the moral or social values of their parents , they have become out of date .while our parents were for example celebrating parties of their quarter or village nowadays young people prefer anonymous discotheques or bars .they seem to barely identify with the places they live in and many of the older people surrounding them .instead peer groups meet in chat rooms on the internt or shopping malls in the outskirts .since many do not feal being part of their community they have no clear idea what or whom they should give their help and time .
