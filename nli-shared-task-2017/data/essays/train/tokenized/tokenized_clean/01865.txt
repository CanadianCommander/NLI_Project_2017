i disagree .there are several reasons why i disagree with statement that says like young people do nt have enough time to helping their communities .first , i think helping their community can be a great chance to learn about how to work .i focus on having lots of experiences during the twenties all the time .there is a word in korea , `` to be a successful man , you should learn and learn , get more and more experiences  .as this word , learning and having experiences is really important for any kind of person .besides , you can have a chance to get together with people meet first time .from my personal experience , the time you should have to be more friendly is not easy .however , after that difficult time , you can have new friends .and also , i think people should know about their communities well .because , the communities are the places where people decide to live , they must have many imformations about their communities to do nt have a bad sight of their leaders and changes .to do a new thing that is not concerned with your studies or works can be felt as a burdern .also some young people think it as a waste of time .but if people change minds and encounter bravely , people can obtain new things and make their life more fresher .these are the reasons why i prefer to helping communities than not to do .
