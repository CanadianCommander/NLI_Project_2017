i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .i believe that there are a lot of young people right now , that contribute to the benefits of our society and/or communities .in the course of the last fifty years , young people have gained a lot of independence from their families and from their communities .we have more freedom , of course within the bounds of our parents rules .but with independece comes responsiblity and i firmly believe that young people take this responsibilty not as a burden , but as a chance .in germany there are several volunteer based organisations , only led by some staff members , but made effective by their large volunteer basis .church - , as well as non-profit - and government-organisations .in these organisations most of the volunteers are young people .they can contribute the time and are willing to contribute the effort to improve something in their community .because of my experience as a volunteer in the afs ( american field service , the world-leader in student exchange ) and another church-organisation i take the freedom to discuss the motivation of young people to engage in these activities .it is a plattform to communicate and connect with other young people , while improving your own `` soft-skills  and helping a worthy project .that seems like a very good oportunity .young people know that they are helping , but in my opinion there is no reason not to have fun while doing it .the discussed statement implies an older speaker , a grown-up , who believes that in his time , young people were doing more for their communities , that he in his youth was doing more , than young people do today .maybe the kind of work changed over the course of years as well .today these volunteer organisations make food ralleys , fundraise money doing car-washing or make benefit tombolas , while in the past , `` helping your community  was maybe more like collecting trash from the community garden .helping your community has become more attractive over the course of time for young people and there are a lot of young people doing this kind of work , but maybe the areas of this work have changed so that for a outside viewer it looks like less is done .
