people have different opinions whether traveling with group and guide is good way or not .i strongly believe that travel is in a group with tour guide is more beneficial because we can save time and money and also that is safety .let me explain for supporting my opinions .first of all , traveling with tour guide who is already know about travel place allow us to save time and money .even though some people worry about tight schedule of group tour , i think that economical advantage is eclipse the weak point .for example , suppose that you travel around where you have never been before , you might be lost road and you do nt know where is best place for traveling .so you need to solve the problems .considering limit time on unknown place , all of things you face with problems is waste of time and money .if you travel with tour guide , you could less the heavy problems and you could save time and money because guide will lead where they already know and where is best place for travel .next , travel with group and guide allow us to safety .although that is unappealing when it comes to challenging aspects , in strange area , the most important thing is safety .for example , if i go to where i have never been before , there are possibilities to be exposed to dangerous things .without assistance of tour guide , i could not avoide that .in addition , as i include in group , i feel more comfortable and stable because there is less chance to be a suspects  target .if i really want to challenge in other countries , i would like to travel where i have already been .therefore , as far as i concerned , keeping my self is the prioty thing for traveling .in conclusion , i prefer to travel with others because of saving time and money , and also i am worried about my safety .moreover , in circustance under safety , i can really enjoy for traveling .
