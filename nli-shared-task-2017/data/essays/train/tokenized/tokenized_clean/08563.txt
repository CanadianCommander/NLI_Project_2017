i do agree to the statement that says `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.  because it is a safer way to travel , it is well organized , you make new connections and learn very intresting insights on the country .i do believe travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than travelling alone because it ensures your security in a country unknown to you .this is especially true if you visit a third world country that speaks a different language than yours .for example , last summer i went to ecuador .while this country is knowned for having many pickpockets , i never got robbed or felt i was watched or followed because i was with a group .i also felt safe because the tguide was from the country and knew where to go .i am sure that if i had gone by myself to ecuador , i wouldm < t have felt safe .hence , groups are a good way to feel safe when you travel .another reason why travelling wiht a group led by a leader is a the best way to visit another country is all the insights given by the tour guide .the tour guide knows a lot about the countrie < s history , and his knowledge certainly helps you better understand the culture , the people and the language of the country you are visiting .even though you might have read about the country in books , the guide always has more interesting approach and interesting facts and anecdotes that you would not find in books .thus , a guide will make your trip more interesting .thirdly , travelling with a group and a guide is less stressful than travelling alone .in fact , a guide takes care of hotel reservations and activities ; you don < t have to worry about anything .isn < t the main purpose of travelling to escape from the stress of work ?also , the guide generally organizes a lot of activities that you wouldn < t ha ve done if you had visited the country alone .therefore , travelling with a guide lets you experience the culture through many activities and makes your stay more enjoyable .for example , i wouldt have gone rafting , canyonering , snorkeling , etc. if all these activities had nt been organized by a guide .hence , travelling with a group gives you the opportunity to make more activiies .finally , when you travel with a group , you make new friends .the group is your temporary family and people you can relate to because you come form the same background .i personnally think sharing a trip with a group is a lot better because you sahre your new experiences with them and you
