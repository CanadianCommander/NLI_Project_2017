i agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not care much about their communities .the change of how people think is the major reason for this problem .first of all , many youngsters nowadays spend much of their time doing their own things , therefore they do not have time to think about their surroundings .for example , many young people want money , so they spend a lot of time on doing jobs .so , they leave home early , and they come back home late .moreover , young people today are becoming extremely lazy .they would rather do something which they can be satisfied in the short-term , rather than the long-term .there are many homes today with television and computers , so young people stay in their homes reffering to watch television than help their communities .these new technologies keep the young people in their homes .finally , the new generation of people are selfish .they would not volunteer to do anything if they do not recieve something .even at schools , a child would not help teachers move books unless they get a candy .a young teenager would not do chores if he does not get an allowance .overall , young men and women today must be satisfied with themselves before thinking of others .it will take a fortune to be satisfied with oneself , so eventually , young people will end up doing nothing to help their communities .
