the issue of knowing if young people enjoy life more than older people do is a interesting one .on the one hand , young people are certainly healthier than the older .but on the other hand , older people have a lot of free time to enjoy life .however , my firm belief is that it is easily to enjoy life for the young people rather than for the older ones .firstly , we have to think of the matter of the health .it is an undeniable fact that young people are in general healthier than the oldest .for example , it is easily to do exercise when you are young .indeed , a lot of old people do have diseases which makes them not unable to do what they want .therefore , if you really like a sport , you will be more able to practice it when you are young .secondly , young people do not have a long experience of life .on the whole , youth may be considered as the time of discoveries , and there are different discoveries .some young people may want to travel all around the world , for example .of course , it is a fact that generally , old people have more money than the youngest .but actually , it does not matter !when you are young , you may think that the comfort is not a prevalent point in a trip .whereas most of young people , old people may have difficulties to travel a lot , just because it is really exhausting .last but not least , young people may enjoy life more than older people just because they have less things to matter .for example , a young people does not worry about his job , about what he has to pay or not each month .a young person has not lived his life yet , and a lot of opportunities are openned to him , he can still decide what is life will be .to conclude , i would like to say that young people do not often enjoy life more than the older , even if it may appear quite obvious .there are also a lot of ways to enjoy life when you are old , because you often have more free-time , and you have much experience than the youngest .you can see your children and your children  children growing , and i think that is one of the beautifulest thing in the world .
