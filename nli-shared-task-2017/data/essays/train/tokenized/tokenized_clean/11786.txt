many people complanain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion this is thrue because this is the way companies use to incite people buying their product , and this is how people can only know about new product .first of all , when company make the advertisement for it product , it wants to make sure that the product looks perfect on the eyes of the puplic .for exemple , if the company make differents type of products , it will make the advertisement of the perfect one .companies ca nt show their weakness for their own products because there will no one who will buy .second , advertisement is the only one way that people will know about new product .for exemple , when the company wants to send the new product on the market , it use advertisement .appearently the company wants to incite people for buying its product that is why it will make it unbelievabely on the advertisement in order to make people think that this product is so good .from this you can understand that most of the time the presentation of many products on advertisements is really different from how they really are .the company are so clever when they make these advertisements because they wants to incite people .
