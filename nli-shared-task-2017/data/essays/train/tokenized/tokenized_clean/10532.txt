it is hard to agree or disagree with such a statement .in my opinion it is obviously a double edge statement .first of all it depends on the way one may define the expression `` successful people  .what does `` being successful  mean ?someone who does something well is successful .howvever it is true that if you understand the expression `` successful people  as being rich then the statement might be relevant .let s take the example of financial markets .the more risks you take the more money you can earn .this is what is happening nowadays and what can explain the growing number of financial mecanisms .the success , or the money here , is considered as a counterpart of th risk one may have taken .it does nt necessarily mean that people who simply do what they already know to do well are not successful , in fact it means that one may become even more successful taking risks .nevertheless , in this case success is not assured .and the statement is a double edge one in that sense as well .the more risk you take the more you can loose .as a consequence the statement could turn out to be reversed .finally , taking risks is even different from trying new things .trying new things is not necessarily very risky .and successful in this case could be understood as `` recognized  , by society for example .for instance , an inventor .someone who invents objects or who discovers phenomenas , because he is very smart and because he has tried to go beyond what he already knew , will be considered as a successful person and will be recognized and remembered as a successful person .as a conclusion , i would say the relevance of the statement depends on the definition one can give to the words and the way you understand it .
