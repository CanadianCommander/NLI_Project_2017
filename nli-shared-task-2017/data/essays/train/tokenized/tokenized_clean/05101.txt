i agree with that statement because learning facts are based on understanding ideas .students can not learn new facts without knowing where they came from or what corroberates them .for some people , memorizing a new fact is enough .it might not be that important to them to understand it or study it .but i disagree with that .there has to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be concidered learning .my favourite subject has always been math because , unlike subjects like history and literature , its all based on logic .everything has an explanation and acknowledging that explanation leads to acknowledging a new fact .when students understand ideas , they become more productive , and more accomplished , because grasping and analizing ideas leads to creativety which leads to creation .students have differents learning skills , some learn by memorizing conlusions , and some cant memorize without an knowing how they reached to the those conclusions .understanding ideas is more difficult that learning facts. a fact can be learned by reading a book or a biography , an idea has to be studied to be learned , which oblidges more thinking .as a result , one who studies new concepts provide more in the community in the future , because what is his or her mind are not just fixed facts , they are ways of thinking .if someone thinks about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economies , it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge , knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing facts but by creative minds .there is more to improvement than learning facts .and when i say improvement i mean in yourself .when you want to imoprove youself you need to understand what you learn to implicate it .thats how the process of teaching works as well .teachers could have just given out books and told students to read them at home and get tested on them the next day .wouldnt that have been easier if the point was nt to make students understand what they re taking in school ?
