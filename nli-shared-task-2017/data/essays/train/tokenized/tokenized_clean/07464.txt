there are lots of perspectives and opinions about the number of cars in use in the future .some people think that we will have plenty of cars as the days are going by , however , i definitely think that we have fewer cars in our future than today .i d like to represent my argument based on the three following reasons : the shortage of fuel , the mass transportation , and restrictions .first of all , we are going to face the shortage of fuel .as we know , cars definitely rely on fossil fuel such as oil and gas .without fuel , no cars can be moved and worked .current and future situation related to the shortage of fuel will lead us to hesitate to buy and produce new cars .furthermore , development in our science allows lots of countries to build well-developed mass transportations such as subway and express trains and convienent bus system .increasingly , people will prefer to utilize mass transportations rather than to drive their own car when shopping , going to work , and travelling .developed system in mass trasnsportation will casuse a revolutionary commuting habits to city dwellers .lastly , we are expecting governmental restictions on using cars in near future .currently in my home country , car drivers have to pay high tax and fee for causing trafffic jam and environmental burden .environemntalists strongly suggest that car producers and car purchasers have to pay more money for using car .in addition , many people agree to the idea because they want to take clean air in .government has no choice but impose more fee and tax for using cars , and will create various way to prohibit car owners from using cars .in short , i absolutely believe that we will have fewer cars on the road in near future based on the above-mentioned reasons .shortage of fuel and governmental restrictions will make drivers hesitate and at the same time , they will choose to take mass transportation .
