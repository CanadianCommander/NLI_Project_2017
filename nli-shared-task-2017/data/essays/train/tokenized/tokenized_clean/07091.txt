`` where there is a will , there is way  .also , generally the willingness is inversely proportional to the years one has lived for .in other words with some reservations i agree with the statement that the desire to enjoy wanes as years pass by .young people are more full of zeal and enthusiam and possess the energy required to be applied to any entertainment activity .these activities could be sports , dance parties , trekking , mountaineering , rafting , surfing so on and so forth .as we reach senility perhaps the will to be the part of a group of happenning people fades off .another reason that may explain that aged people have limitations while they want to enjoy is the level of responsibilities they bear .even if they plan to go out for a movie that may not require physical exercise , various trivial things are always after their life .child wanting to have an ice cream when the ` hero  is just planning to elope with his lady . ..ooops .further , what if he wants to play with a car that is at home . ..unimaginable .these may seem to be very minor things but when it comes to solve the problem enjoyment and entertainemnt are left far behind .take another contrasting example of children below 5 .no school blues , no home works , no restriction , nobody to take care of .quite easily they get the permission to play with their friends .as technology and science have progressed so have developed the ways to get an exhilirating body / mind work out .video games for example are accessibilities that children cherish .as older people may not be well acquainted with more modern machines they may find it difficlut to enjoy in this way .while i rewrite that where there is a will there is a way i am not just repetitive .i now want to present the reservations i mentioned in the introduction .however , old age may bring physical weakness , loss of agility , there are various methods in which they try and live their lives to fullest .golf , the game of old gentlemen is quite a challenging affair , which even i have nt ever been capable to win .chess is the next trump card they come up with when no body movement is desired .moreover , i have seen people who have their secret groups in which they organise personal parties , go for trips and enjoy life in the way they want .after , all the examples and explanations i would like to conclude that fervor is the only requisite ingredient .age doest matter a lot ( but certainly to some levels it does ) .
