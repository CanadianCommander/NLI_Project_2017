is really everything you see in advertisments is better ?its hard question to answer because ther are some products are really better than it shows in the advertisments and the others are do nt .i disagree about the food s product because they do nt care by the people at all , the important think for them is how to collect the money from people , but no body asks him selfe this quistion is that really this food healthy ? .no body from them asks how many one will suffring if they use this product .let me be more spacific and talk about kind of food which is the humberger .we watch alot of advertisements about it , in tv , newspaper , magazine , and we hear them in the radio station , but i never heard from those people explanation if the product is healthy or not .is the product helping peopl have a bad colestrol or not .in fact the humberger increase the bad colestrol , and it couse alot of heart problems such as the hart attack .unfortuanatly , the government dos nt care .they care only for colecting money from them , but the people it dos nt matter if they will go to the hill .in the same time i agree there are a products show in advertisements helping the people .for example the products helping the handecab people , or any kind of product give a real advice to the people such as , the medicin product , of course we will ask our doctors abut it .also i disagree about the product became an a dengerous .for example the advertisements call people to jump from over the mountain , or eat some insects like fear factor program , i know there is a warning in the program , but the people do like them exactly , and they got hurts .so we need to be honest with our advertisement and with people .
