certain people believe that young people enjoy life more that older people do .on the other hand some people disagree with the idea of young people enjoying life more than older people do .in my personal opition , i strongly agree with the fact that younger people have relatively more time to enjoy life than old people do for several reasons according to the amount of responsibility , energy and time .one of the major reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older poeple do is closely related to the amount of responsibilities that older people and younger people have .in my opinion , getting older means receiving more responsibility .based on my personal experience , as a high school student , i used to play games , meet friends , and did not worry that much on my future .however , as i grow older , i started to feel pressure , get responsibility and worry about my future which i have to prepare from now on .as a result , i strongly agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do .another main reason that young people enjoy life more than older people is based on the amount of energy that young people and old people can spend and enjoy .for example , based on my personal experience , i used to eager to travel and visit foreign contries when i was young .however , as a grow older and i receive more responsibility , i started to get lazy about enjoying life .in addition , i put the studying primary than enjoying my life .it is the reason why most parents sacrify their enjoy for their children because they have the responsibility of being parents .last but not least , another huge reason that young people enjoy life more that older people is closely connected with the amount of time that young people and older people contain .as i stated above , as people grow older , more responsibilities they get .therefore , older people will have less time to enjoy their leisure time .based on the amount of responsibility , energy and time , i strongly agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more that older people do .therefore , i would recommend young people to enjoy their life before they grow older .
