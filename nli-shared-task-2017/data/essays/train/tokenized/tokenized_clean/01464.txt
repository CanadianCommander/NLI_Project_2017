having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects without a specific specialization would give one information that is excessive , irrelevant , desultory in nature if it has to be applied to one s vocation , service , a profession .so i would disagree with the pursuit of many fields of study without any subject to specialize in .for example , if a student of engineering pursues courses in performing arts , like dance , it might enhance the talent and social value of the person but it would not contribute to his performance in his role as an academician or a professional as an engineer .each subject has many specializations within its field .education in itself is expensive .compared to the working population , for various reasons , a relatively smaller percentage of people pursue education after high school , earn a baccalaureate degree and then begin , complete graduate school also .for example , psychology has other sub-fields of clinical , counseling , education which serve different purposes in helping the recipients of its services .or let s take the example of a doctor who has taken courses in various subjects rather than emphasizing his learning in surgery , or medicine , or cancer .how can he/she help patients to get well with a broad knowledge that covers subjects of political science , medicine , english etc . ?if the schools of higher learning do not build their departments around a particular subject , for example , social work or social policy ; the administration , teaching , evaluation the courses being taught would suffer seriously .till secondary school level , many academic subjects can be learnt and it is good for our general knowledge .but as the focus of education shifts to colleges and universities , it makes sense intellectually , practically , knowledge-wise to specialize in one specific subject .this would help people to fulfil various roles , perform the services required to have a functional society .the society , its educational , social and health systems would be in chaos in the event of a scenario where education would lack focus , training , depth in every particular field of study .
