there are many successful poeple in various fields in this world .it can be business , sports , arts , or science .however , there is a common thing that those successful people have : successful pople try new things , take risks , and also respect the traditions and the old ways that have been known for a long time .for example , a tennis player can not start creating a new way of hitting spine serve without knowing how to hit the ball properly .the player has to go thorough the tough steps of learning basic hitting techniques before doing something new .therefore , knowing and respecting the traditions and the old ways is the fundemental step for the person to be successful .however , just knowing about the past is not good enough for most cases .here , i will use an example of a researcher in biology lab .even if the researcher obtained good grades during his/her undergraduate level and have great ability of learning what other scientists have done in the past , the researcher is not granteed to be a successful scientist if she/he lacks the ability of creativity .so , the ability to apply what the person have learned about the traditions and the old ways into new things is the second important element to be successful .taking risk may be the third element to be successful ; however , it is not the case in some fields .for example , a doctor with a great knowledge and ability to adopt it can not take risks to cure his/her patients if the doctor s attempting and taking risks result in a number of patients  death .however , it is also true that surgents and physicians often take risks in operation room in order to help thier patients .finally , being successful is not neccessary important , and maybe it is not something other people judge if the person is successful or not .as long as the person is satisfied with his/her life and provides a great influences for the world , the person can be considered as `` successful  .
