i have always been told that you can never get what you want if you do not try , or in other words , if you do not take risks .i totally agree with that statement .as i told it previously , i admit that people who take risks by trying new things can get what they really want and thereafter be very successful .i mean that if you never try to do something different from what you are used to do at least once in your whole life , it is too bad .let s talk about the actors for instance .some of them always act the same kind of characters and that is nice persons or on the contrary a bad person .this is a good thing for them because they always know how to act since it is always the same thing .however , some other actors sometimes try to act an opposite character that the one they are used to perform .morgan freeman for instance has often performed nice character in his movies and one day , he accepted to play the  nasty  in the movie called  dreamcatcher  .it was a very surprising to see him as a nasty but in spite of all that , the movie was great and had success and so the actor is .
