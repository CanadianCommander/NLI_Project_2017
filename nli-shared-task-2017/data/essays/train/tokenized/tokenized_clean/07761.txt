i disagree with the statement according to which it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts for the following reasons :first , a theory must always be followed by a praxis , as the austrian philosopher karl popper used to state at the beginning of last century .as an example , this makes me think of the last class on pedagogy i attended at the university of bologna ( italy ) a couple of weeks ago : the professor told us that students need to know facts , but it is also true that in my country on the whole we students are not trained so practical way second , i believe that what makes history is praxis , facts and events , not just theory : it is the praxis that determines the changes and the development of history .third , a young student who is more `` theorical  than practical ( just like me unfortunately , i should say ! ... )can give the impression of living in another world and he sometimes can even have some difficulties in everyday life : how many times have i personally felt somehow lost and unconfident in practical situations that apparently were not so hard to face ! ...that is due to the fact that unfortunately i am still not so experienced , i believe . .. !in conclusion , i believe that ideas and concepts should always be related and applied to facts , even though i can understand that that is not always the case .
