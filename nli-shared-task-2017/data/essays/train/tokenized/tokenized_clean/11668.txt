there are many ways to travel but the one way that i most prefer is to travel is in a group by a tour guide .therefore , i agree with the following statement .first , the tour guides are able to help us .when we go with tour guides , they knew where are the best places and the most popluar places that travellers go , so we can go the places that are popular and places so we do nt have to spend much of time by going unpopular places and un neccessary to go .also , the travel with the tour guides are more comfortable .for example , the tour guides are able to speak the language that you traveled so we do nt have to spend time by having a conversation problem and they also know .second , we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them .when i traveled to europe .i met a lot of people in there .there is a person who live in island and someone who lives far away from me .while we move to other country or city we always have to spend five to four hour by riding a bus so we played variety games and we became freinds on a last day of the trip .after the trip we traded each others address , telephon number and e-mail .also , after that when i visited the island that one of the member lives i had a luch with them and talked about the europe trip that we had a few month ago and we trade each others photos by sending e-mail .i like the travel that in a led by a tour guide because the tour guides are able to help us and we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them but i think what ever way it is travel gives so many rememberable remembers !
