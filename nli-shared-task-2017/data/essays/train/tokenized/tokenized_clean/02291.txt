would you like to study broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?i believe different people have different answers .however , i prefer to study broad knowledge for several reasons below .first , in fact , many students do not konw what they are really interested in .as we know , nowadays , many students have a same problem that they do not like their majors .why dose this problem happen ?i believe that it is resulted from that they are not interested in their majors .if they can study broad knowledge of many academic subjects , they would find out that what they are really interested in .this is very important .actually , i have this problems , too .my major is material science .and i can not study other subjects in my university .however , i do not like my major , because i can not find out any interesting things from this major .every day i have to do experiments in my lab , which is boring .in fact , i want to learn some subjects that i could communicate with other people .i believe if i have another choice , i would not choose this major again .as a result , i choose another major when i study for my mater degree now .second , in modern society , most of jobs require students have many skills , instead of a certain skill .as we know , when people work in a company , he has to know how to use computer , because today most of works are finished on computers , and the communication with other thoughout emails or msn also need to be done on computers .if this person only know about his major , such mathmetic , arts , or something else , i do not believe that he would have a capability for this work .that is to say , he would be fired in future .i believe this is a pity for our education in universites .consequently , we should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects to fillful the various requirement of many jobs .if we have kinds of knowledge , we could do many jobs in a company , and we have more chances to get promotoed .for example , if we learn knowledge about engeering and management in university , we could apply for two types of jobs in a company , which would be very useful for our career in the future .however , to learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects does mean that it is unnecessary to specialize in one specific subject .what i mean is that we should also be professional experts , because when we face with some difficulties in our work , we must have academic knowledge to address them .this is of great essence to us .in sum , we should learn broad knowledge in the first place , and then we also have to specialize in one specific subject .
