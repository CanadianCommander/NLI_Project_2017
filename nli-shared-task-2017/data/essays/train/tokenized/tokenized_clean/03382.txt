the cars are inevitable vehicles used for the transportation purposes .nearly every family owns a car nowadays .but in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there is today due to the advances in public transportation , high oil prices and the increasing awereness of the society about the environmental drawbacks of the cars .as the modern cities are getting larger and larger , the existing public transportation systems are improved and new ways of public transportation are introduced to the use of the society .in many cities , new , wider and more comfortable busses are provided by the local administrations .moreover , the bus routes are extended in a way that they will cover all the parts of the towns and cities .so that a person who has to commute to work in an unaccessable part of the city by bus , now can use the comfortable buses and thus the need for the car dissappears .in my opinion in twenty years the advances in the public transportation system will result in fewer cars in use .furthermore the oil prices are too high .each day , the ratio of the people who can afford life with car is decreasing due to outrages oil prices .also the prices are fluctuating and eventually increasing because of the wars in the areas of oil production .due to economical reasons , people will quit buying and driving cars in the near future .moreover the society became aware of the fact that cars are giving great harm to the the enviroment .the usage of unsustainable energy sources , the oil in the case of cars , is causing serious damage , such as air pollution .with the help of scientists and media , the society is getting aware of this fact and in the end the usage of cars will decrease .to sum up , there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because of the advancement in the public transportation systems , economical reasons regarding high oil prices and the increasing awareness of society about environmental damage caused by cars .
