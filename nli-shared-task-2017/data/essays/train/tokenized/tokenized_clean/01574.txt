people often say that giving is receiving .a lot of people argue that nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , to help people .first of all , we will see why it is possible to argue that in our society , people do not open up to the others , that young people are not engaged for helping the others .then , we will point out that in the new coming century , a lot of people give time to their community , that they do not hesit in involving in programs opened to the others .on the one hand it is possible to argue that the society we live in encourages people to live without looking around .everything goes fast , everything is turned to the financial aspect of the existence .thus , young people hesit to give some time to their community because they do not see what the community can give them in exchange .nowadays , the process of profits is the origin of the lack of involving of young people into associations or into charities .a lot of associations need young people to act .but unfortunatly , a lot of these groups only receive help from seniors .for young people , they just have to give to the other , who is also able to give him something .that is the reason why it is possible to say that young people really hesit to give time to their community .on the other hand , it is also evident that young opeople are today definitly involved in several groups aiming at helping their communities .indeed , a lot of these young people join every year some student associations , some group aiming at helping homeless people , or disabled citizens .today , after each crisis like a war , or a disaster just like the great tsunami or katrina in the us , young people activly help the others .they often are the origin of several movements .as far as i am concerned , i believe that young people know how to act and that the ways of actinfg are nowdays differents than some decades before .young people are creative and do not hesit to give time to their community .the way of acting for juniors is different , but it is still the same idea : giving is receiving .
