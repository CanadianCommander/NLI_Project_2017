i think it s better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .today we find a job world that does nt wait our studies , our trainings .graduates are much more than in the ` 90 , and afterall they are more younger , the challenge in these terms are very strong .the industry , the company , ...the job world marks point on these : your skills have to be more stronger than a while .we study to find a good job , remunerative and , anyway , that turns back awards .because of this , if all of we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ( who better of others , that s clarify ) , we certainly have more problem to find the dreams  job .in spite of this , if somebody has a specialistic skill , maybe he ll find less work announces that respond to his qualifing , but surely he wo nt challenge , such as others with a widespread standard knowledge , too hard to obtain that work .i m an `` almost engineer  , i see every day on the newspapers , on tv , at my university how hard is today find worthy people : too many people have to broad knowledge of many academic subjects , too many people have to challenge on the same jobs .this is my personal opinion on this stateme
