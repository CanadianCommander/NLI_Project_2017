nowadays , people are trying to succeed in life in various ways .they do this by learning new things , adquiring advanced technology , reading , updating themselves with whats going on in the world , and coming up with strategically ideas in which they can use these not only in the business , but personally .i agree with this statement because if people did nt take any risks we would still be far behind technology , knowledge , etc .the problem is , many people do nt like to take risks because they do nt want to lose time in trying out new things , they usually stick to what they re good at , at that point .another problem is that many of us are afraid to fail and just do nt want to regret the time we spent , money , our sacrifice .most people just sit around and live up to other people expectations .in the other hand , i understand the fear people have in taking risks because at the end , it all comes down to one question : is it going to be worth it ?well , you may not have an answer right away but as i said , if we do nt take risks at any chance , we will just be sitting around , waiting , and doing the same thing over and over again .going back through history , if mechanical people , engineers , architects , would nt have taken risks in manufacturing some kind of transportation for the world , we would probably still be walikng through one place to another .the great discoveries that have occured took place because of the people who took a risk back then and we are what we are because of those people .for example , microscope , telefone , medicine , transportation , internet .in conclusion , we should all take risks at some point of our lives .we could make dramatic changes in life by helping ourselves , others and the world by contributing and passing on our knowledge and courage .
