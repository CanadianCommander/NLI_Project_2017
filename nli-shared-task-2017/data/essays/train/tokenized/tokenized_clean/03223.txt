yes , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for example , a product say a shampoo or some beauty product is advertised in an extra-ordinary manner with a beautiful woman , a serene background , a great and pompous music and captivating puchlines and narration .but , in reality i dont think the product would be so great .it would be like any other beauty product that we may be using with slight differences in colour , odour and ofcourse , the price .most companies advertise their products in this manner because , they have to compete with other companies which manufacture similar products .each manufacturing company wants to be ahead of all of its counterparts .so , each company tries to advertise its product in a unique manner so that conmsumers are attracted towards its products .they advertising procedure is unique but the products will be some what similar .this is because , a product manufactured to meet a particular requirement has more or less the same ingredients .for example , basic ingredients of a cold cream will always be the same .so , each manufacturer has to use the same basic ingredients to manufature the cold cream .the things which can be different are the colour and odour of the cold cream , its packing style etc .other reasons for such pompous advertisements could be to lure the consumers to buy more and more of their products .if advertising is done in a grand way by involving a popular personality or a celebrity then that would attract more attention and will help in the increasing the sales of the product .for example , if a product is endorsed by a hollywood star , then many of his/her fans and admirers would buy the product out of their adulation towards the star .so , advertising is done in a very grand and pompous manner using various marketing techniques in order to increase the sale of a product , though the product may not be as great as it would be shown in the advertiment .this is done to increase the sales of the product so that it brings in profits to its manufacturing company .
