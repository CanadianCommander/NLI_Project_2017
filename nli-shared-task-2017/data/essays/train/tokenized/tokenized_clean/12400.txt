i agree this statement which is more importaint for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .because if you understand ideas and concept , you can use the different way ahving your knowlege more than fact .for example , right now i am taking math class .usually , every question already have the answer .you can check answer from the answerseet .however , when i was solving some questions , i could not get the answer .you might think you cans check the answer from the book .even i check the answer and see the fact , i feel that i want to know the idea which how to get the answer .fact can not use different way , as i mention only know the answer which is fact is not able to use anotherway .another example is language .i am also taking chinese class .every character has different meaning .some character has so cunfusing line and sometimes tree for four character is mix together and becomes one word .the word chinese character of domitory has roof , people , and hundred meaning of character .the reason why is that people live together under the oneyou just remember the word as fact , you might not care about reason .if you want to understand ideas of each word , you can guess the meaning .you can guess what is character means using your relative goods or life .if you just know the fact , you can not gusee anymore .
