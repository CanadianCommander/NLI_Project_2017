the statement `` successful people try new things and take riks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  in my opinion clearly illustrates the main reason why people become successful after all .i think that it is obvious that successful people are people that stick out of society and out of the establishment , not only because of their success but also because of new inventions or techniques used by them .certainly , successful people are people who do not do things the way everyone does them , just in order to be different from everyone else .a successful manager for example has to find new ways to improve his business , his finances and to motivate his coworkers to really change something .the concept of change is crucial in this discussion , because as i am convinced success always has to do with change .many times this change is not positive at the beginning because it hurts to change something that has proved it s usefulness and value for a person , a business or a company .change can be slow at the beginning and sometimes may be proved wrong , but in the majority of the cases , change is the key to success .therefore , i think it goes without say why successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing things they are good at .another point that supports the statement derives from the psycological area .people who are successful are happy and selfcontent , at least in most cases .if someone feels good about the things he or she does , and in addition to that feels good about him - or herself , it is easier to try out something new and challenging .self-esteam helps you to realise the things you want to do and the things you are dreaming of , even though they may seem new and risky .a person who is always aware of his failures and negative traits is not even willing to try something new thanks to the fear of failing again .successful people on the other hand are not that likely to be put down if something does not work out as they planned it to be .one last point i d like to mention in order to conclude this essay is the human hunger for power .once you have achieved something , even such a non-material thing as success , you do nt want it to be lost .you probably would do nearly everything , including taking small risks and trying out new things , to maintain the standard .
