i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in three reason , it can be proved , exazageration , repeating , and useing famous person .first of all , exageration is good evidence .some company can not lie about the its production .however , they usually use other factors in advertisements .for example , there are many heathy people and they always smile in the madicine advertisements .even though people usually get a medicine when they sick , the advertisements always shsw healthy and happy people .the consumer might think that they could be healthy if they get the medicine .but , it is wrong .this is exageration of advertisements .second , many company usually use famous person for advertisements .if a famous person says  this is good product .and i am useing this product everyday.  , people believe it .people believe it because they are famous person .but , usually the product is not concerned with the famous person .people think that they can be nice if they use it .but it is wrong because it is just advertisement .third , repeating is one of methods many company can use in their advertisements .when people hear a prase again and again , usually people remember the word and praise .it is not necessory to say that they will buy the product when they see it .for example , my wife and i usually go to shopping together .when we see the same product which we saw in advertisement , we usually buy it .because the product is only one thing that we have a information about it .even thouth it is just the product s name or praise it often make an important roll in my decision .in conclusion , i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because many company use exazageration , a famous person , and repeating , people buy the product .
