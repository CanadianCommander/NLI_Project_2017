i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .they want to live life fully to the end and enjoy it .i have good reasons to support this idea .first of all , young people have more enthusiasm to try new things and enjoy them .for example , if you have asked a 20 years old college kid if he wants to do rafting , he would go for it .however , if you have asked the same question to a 50 years old man , he would probably say that he is too old to try it .so , this is the first reason why i believe that younger people enjoy life more .secondly , young people are more spontenaous .for example , if a friend have called and asked to go out for dinner in half an hour , a young person would say `` ok , i ll see you there in half an hour  , but an older person would stay home with the family because they have responsibilities .thus , young person would have fun and enjoy the dinner .also , i believe that as people get older , they become less energetic which keeps them away from enjoying life .for example , my grandmother is 75 years old and i can never take her out to do shopping which i enjoy a lot .she finds it very exhausting and prefers to stay home by herself .then , she thinks about my grandfather who passed away 10 years ago and gets depressed .this is another reason why older people can not enjoy life as much as young people .finally , the friends have great impacts .when you are 20 years old , you would have friends around your age , almost the same maturity .even if you were a boring person , they would push you to enjoy the life and have fun .however , when you get older , you can not have the same realtionship with the friends .in conclusion , i believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older ones .i believe that everything is possible and easier to do when you are young .so , we should not postpone anything for later .
