when human society stepped into 21st centry and technology developped , more and more people realized that understood ideas and concepts were useful .it is no doubt that ideas and concepts were mostly like a key to crate something especially for students .i totally agree with this statement : it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i will list three points to support my opinion .the most important thing is to gain the knowledge from the ideas and concepts .i m a student which have learned our history .for me , i think most of the antiquity history like mirrors .history reflect the current events .also , there are many ideas and concepts in history .no matter what we did , it still come from our history .the other factor , which is equally important , is that the ability which is the view of things from one to three .for instance , my roomate who come from northeast of china are good at hard science .when her lab teacher told her to finish a project , she always do it right and fast .you know what , because she got the ideas and concepts , not just learn from facts .it more important for students to have this skill to study .the last one but not the least one is that the appearance of new technologhs .everybody knows that japan were famous for its small technics .producting others countries product and absorbing that then having their own technology is their actions .do nt borde that .more than 50 % countries was follow them .because japanese got the ideas and concepts form other technics .from what i mentioned above , we can draw the conclusion that for students , understand ideas and concepts is more important than the facts we learn .i suggest the students who want to be success to keep this mind in your head .
