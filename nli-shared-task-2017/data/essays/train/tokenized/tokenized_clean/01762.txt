a young man enjoy life more than an old person .many people are of this opinion but i disagree with this statement .it is true that young people have energy and excitment that keeps them going .on the other hand , elderly who have experienced all kinds to situations in their life time show less enthusiam .how ever this dose nt mean they do nt enjoy life .they enjoy happy moments of life as any other individual of the society .many elderly couple go out for vacation after they retire and they just relax in places like florida .many elderly go for world tour after their retirement to explore life around the world .they attain satisfaction by fulfilling their long cherished dreams .many a time aged also pamper themselves with the favorite articles of use like jwellary , gadgets etc .if one is gets involved in activities he loves to do he would surely derive happiness aged very often indulge full time in their hobby and work they love to do .after the age of 60 they want to do anything and every thing that they have not not done but wanted to do while they were working to make their ends meet .for example , some who are humanitarian may start volunteering fot non profits and gain pleasure by helping others in need , whereas some other may prefer to engage him self in creative hobbies like pottery , gardening , music etc .it is said that old people are like kids .old people love to play with their grand children .they derive fun and excitement in playing , hopping around with kids , telling them stories etc .to sum up i would say that most of times old people are independent of any responsibility thus they have enough time to relax , chill and seek joy in things that makes them happy .they have have the sense of accomplishment and fulfillment which enables them to live life freelly as they want .
