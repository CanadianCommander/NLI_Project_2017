the topic state that `` it is better to have knowledge of a number of academic subjects than having specialization in one specific subjects  and i tend to disagree .the reason for taking this stand is this - although education systems through out the globe support both the modes of study yet a specialist is any ways prefered over a person who is a kind of `` jack of all trades  .before going into depth let me remind you about a normal prcedure of education these days .when a child goes to school then in order to make him acquainted with all things in the surrounding , he is tought a variety of subjects .later on , in his teens , he is taught the basic of all the major streams , so that he can choose his major .finally , this all goes in the direction of choosing one subject , and all the subjects are touched so that he can find out the flow of his interests .now lets talk about `` specialization  .the specialzation is required for depth knowledge of a subject .to work over a subject you always need that and all the subjects ( available for major ) are having enough depth to spend your life working on it .i remember one very well said line `` practice makes a man perfect  .in the same way a specialists is always having his concentration at a subject and is working out with that subject all the time in order to get best results for the well-fare of the society .here , i can also take example of myself .what would i do in case i get a heart problem ?i would definetly go to a heart specialist .the similar situation can be applied in all the problems you encounter in your life .its true a basic knowledge of each and every subject is required to sustain your life without getting stucked at every other hurdle that comes but broad knowledge of many academic subjects will make life a mess .you would not be able to comentrate on one thing .hence , i would always prefer going for a specialization instead of mugging my head in a number of subjects at a time .
