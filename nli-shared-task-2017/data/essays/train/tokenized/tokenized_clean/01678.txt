nowadays , there are many people belive that only doing what they already know how to do well is true .nevertheless , i absolutely disagree this point at all .i think that a successful people show try things and take risks to beome successful .there are many successful person also take many high risks before he/she beome successful and well-known .bill gate is a typical example in this situtation .when bill gate was still a student in university , he realized that he would be a great man and hired by a big company with great amount and stable salary after he gratuated .although he realized that situtation , but he still decided to take a risk to abandon his study and started to invented some softwares .moreover , he asked asked on of his friend to abandon study and go with him to create a business .nevertheless , he rejected eventually .a few years later , bill gate became the richest man in the world with several millions of dollars .on the othr hand , although his friend was graduated from the university of oxford , he was only a manager of a small company .an other example is my father , he ws not skillful in studying when he was young : therefore , he started to created his own business instead if studying or working for a company for many years .now he becomes a very successful person and my idol .in conclusion , i think people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is because if we are not skillfull in studying or working for others , why do we have to waste our precious time to do the thingd without any result .moreover , i think people should try new things when they are young , because it is useful to regret when they become old .
