for students , they should understand ideas and concepts in class for getting good marks on their tests or some important exams , at the same time , they should learn facts in their lives as well .actually it is not easy to tell which one is more important , as both of them are essential elements in life .however , i prefer to choose learn more facts for the life , because you will not always stay at school as a student , but you will need to know facts for dealing with your life forever .nowadays , more and more parents want their children get higher education , as it not only helps them to get a good job in the future , but also helps them to know how to use proper ways to deal with life problems .in china , students are learning so hard that sometimes they just can not get enough sleep .i will not say it is a wrong way to guide students , i just a kind of worrying about what is the students and their parents really want ?just understand ideas and concepts in textbooks , and then get good marks ?no , they do nt .anyway , some examples already make people think about this problem .a friend of mine told me a story about a tipically `` good  student .ming is the best student in his school , and his parents , all his teachers and classmates are proud of him very much , as he always gets near perfect on his tests . ..it means he understands ideas and concepts of textbooks very well .once , he got like 96 % on a exam , and one of his friend beated him as 97 % , he was so crazy about it that he hurt himself using a knife .i just can not believe that , can we say ming is a perfect student ?no , he is nt .he should know he can not always be the best one in the school , and he should accept fact that others will be better than him .another thing is he should learn to make good friends and share his talents and life experiences with them .maybe you will say this example is extreamel , actually , when your parents and other people around you require you too much , you will feel so stressful and upset that you even can not do anything , at this time , you need to know more facts to face it , like how to deal with stress , how to stop people around you require you too much , and how to enjoy the life .for example , we should know one fact , which is a person living in a world , we should be educated for sure , on the other hand , we need keep our hobbies , and share our joy with people we love as well .for me , school is not the most important thing , i would like to learn more facts in the life , that are more interesting !
