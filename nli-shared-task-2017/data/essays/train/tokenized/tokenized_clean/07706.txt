without questions , i agree witn this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .i have two reasons for this opinion : energy and freedom .first of all , i think that young people are able to exercise more harder then older people because they are young , so they have a lot of energy in general .in my grandfather s case , he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even the huge things when he was 21 years old .moreover , he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured when he was junior high-school .i guess he was a tough boy , but he never plays sports now .furthermore , he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster end play some sports when you are 70 years old .secondly , i asserts that young people can fall in love with their classmates , school friends and so on easily .in my case , i loved some girlfriends when i was a high-school student .it was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me .however , the older people can not propose the people they love or like , i think .it is because that older people have their husbands or wives in many cases .of course , if you are young and not married , you can make boyfriend or girlfriend freely .while it may be true that not every young people can fall in love with someone , and older people tend to have much money than young people .however , young people are given the freedom .that s why they may be find their love affairs and are given money by thier parents .to be young means that to be free , i think .in conclusion , i support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .his/her energy and freedom enables him/her to enjoy life , i think .
