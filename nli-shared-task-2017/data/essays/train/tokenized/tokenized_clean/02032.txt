in now day , many students learn things by memorize but not getting the main ideas .learing facts are important , but is nt it understanding the ideas and concepts of what you are doing much more improtant ?students has to know and have a idea what they are doing instead of just following the instrutions in a robort way .first of all , students are not able to do the test if they do not understand the concept of the subject or unit .for example , when you are doing a physics test , how can you do the calculations without knowing how the question is asking for ?sure , you can memorize the formulas and plug the numbers in for sure , but what if the teacher changed the question a little bit of what he is asking for ?so , understanding is really important .next , facts is truth , of course it is important in daily life , but what does facts do with the educations of students at school ?student s job at school is to learn something that he or she is not able to learn at home .whatever the teachers have taught , if you do not understand what he or she meant , if you do not get the concepts , how are you able to learn things ?for example , macbeth by shakespears , if you have actually read the play that shakespears wrote , are you able to do the test by only reading it ?you surely have to understand the main idea of what he was writting and what he wanted the reader to understand .this is the ideas of the play .as a result , there are so many things in the world that the students may not know yet .but since the students understand the concepts or ideas for being a students , they are going to learn many things throughout their school life .
