currently , there are more people who help the others than before .at the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war .people had big problems and they only tried to survive .they did not want to solve the problems of the others , they only wanted to eat and to care their families .however , right now , all the people do not have big problems and they are more implicated with their communities .in my personal expericence i could explain these arguments with several examples .when i was young , my teachers at highschool encouraged students to help other people in their subjects , even if that students were in an other school .i felt very well because i coul help a lot of people who do not know how to speak or how to write .i remeber two girls that they were 8 years old and they didnt know how to read .i helped them twice a week during for years and they finally learn not only how to read , but also how to write .furthermore , when i was at the university , i created with my friends one organitation that prepare conferences in order to obtain money for poor people .we could collected a lot of money by doing these conferences .on the other hand , right now , i usually go to the church in order to serve food for the people who do not have nothing to eat .more or less i often go to the church once a week .in my view , the people are more implicate in their communities than they are before .the society has changed because if someone explain in an interview for finding a job that he helps in his community , he probably be hired because all the companies wants honesty in their organisations .
