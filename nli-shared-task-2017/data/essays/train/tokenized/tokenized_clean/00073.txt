travelling around the world is a very interesting and educating experience .in order to fully enjoy the trip , we should decide wether to travel alone or in a group led by a tour guide .actuallty , i prefer such organized tripes rather than travelling by my self for several reasons .the first reason is the positive impact of having a tour guide .tour guids are very well educated about the historical , and cultural background of the places the group is visiting .therefore , the tourists get more knowledge and deep explanations of what they see , especially in historical attractions .as the result , the trip becomes much valiable .for example , i travelled to a great historical place in egypt and the tour guide was very helpful to explain every tiny detail of the temples .i think i would have not been able to get such huge amount of information if i just traveled alone .another advantage of having a tour guide is that he or she can help tourists find good places for shopping by suggesting certain shopping areas .the second reason is the advantage of having a group .people from different countries , backgrounds , and experiences are travelling together does have a positive impact .for example , i had a trip two years ago with a group and i learned alot from them talking about their countries and the best places they saw in other trips .i gained valuable inormation about places i wanted to go and had not enough information to help me .moreover , i can benefit from a group rate while going for shopping with the organized trip .the prices will be cheaper , so that i can buy more things .in conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .spending the trip withe experienced tour guide as well as a whole group of people , will give a great oppportunity to learn more in an informal and interesting environment .the trip will be diffenitly more valuable if it is spent with such great accompany .
