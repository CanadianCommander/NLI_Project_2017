i agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .my reasons for this are three folds .firstly , in my opinion , ideas and facts are broder termsthan facts .therefore , when a student learns about ideas and concepts she  he may also have the chance to see the facts behind them .however , if a student only learns about a fact , he  she would not be able use this fact when necessary .this would be mainly because of the inability of the student to make this fact concrete in her  his mind because of lack of ideas and concepts related with this fact .secondly , learning a fact alone would not probably take the attention of the student very much .however , in oder to motivate students to learn more about their fields of studies , the topics of their studies should be interesting .most probably an interesting lesson would help students to be more willing and more motivated to make further research and investigation about that topic .in that way , understanding ideas and concepts rather than merely learning facts would help students to develop themselves as well .thirdly , to my point of view , understanding ideas and concepts make students more creative .if they undertand ideas and concepts about a topic  then they can apply them into their lives .for example , they can develope new theories .which can also make contributions to their fields of studies .being creative is a very important aspect and of an education system .due to that reason , understanding ideas and concepts would be critiical in the personal development of a student .ultimately , for all of the reasons i have mentioned above , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
