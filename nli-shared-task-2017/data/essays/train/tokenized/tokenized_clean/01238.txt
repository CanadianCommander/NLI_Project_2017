i agree with the statement .first , nowadays there are many cars in use , you can see everywhere , we use them instead of by foot , because it s easy and fast .but the air pollution problem is became a strong problem .most car-gases be taken into the air , and we breath dirty gas into our body .when twenty yeas past , i think our air will be destroyed badly .so the govement must be reduce the cars productions and the cars will be fewer use than there are today .second , people today use cars instead of by foot because they are comfotbal , but they have nt realize that step by foot is a body exercise for our health .we can stronthen our body and do more exercises everytime .third , use fewer cars can reduce our traffic jam .today big cities are all have terrible traffic , especally in rush times , and more traffic jam happened , whenthe cars became fewer the problem will be sloved .and we are more safty when we out .became the population grew more and more , this method must be a good one .above these three reasons , i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and our life will be more comfotbal and safty .
