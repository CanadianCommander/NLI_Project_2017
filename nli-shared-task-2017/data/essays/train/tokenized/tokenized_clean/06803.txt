although some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i do not agree with that .there are three reasons for me to get this opinion .first , older people have much more experience than younger people because they are simply older .for example , when younger people make holidays in cities they are often more interested in making party than to get to know more about the city and its cultural life .old people spend more of their time by learning something about the place where they make holidays .i think that older people see much more of a city when visiting it than younger people do because for me it is important to learn about the cultural life of the place where you in .furthermore , old people have much more time than younger people because they have seen much more in their life .in contrast , younger people are often interested in seeing much in a short period of time because in their view they have not seen enough yet .for instance , in most cases older people take much more time when they visit a museum than younger people do .last , often old people have saved a lot of money while their time as employee .they have much more money to spend and they have not to attach importance on how to spend their money .in contrast , the younger people are at the beginning of their time as employee and so they have not earned much money that they could save yet .so they are not able to waste their money as old people can .in conclusion , this are the three reasons why i disagree with the statement .
