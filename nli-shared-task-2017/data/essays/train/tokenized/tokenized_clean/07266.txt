i agree with the statement .we can forthseeing the future world .firstly , the energy crises is coming .if we can not find other source of energy , there will have no energy source for the cars .the energy price will grow up many many times from now .citizen may travel by public-transport instead owning a car .moreover , the government will control the numbers of privite cars to control this problems .next , the mass-transit transport will carry most of the passengers .so the needs of the cars is decrease .secondly , all vehicles will produces pollutions including electrical-vehicles .it is because when generating energy , the there are many exhauted gas came out .for examples , co2 and so2 .according to the increase of voice in `` earth saving  , people will most transported by public-vehicles .for example , they will transport by railway instead of dissel-cars .thirdly , for the development of the tele-communication , citizen may not need to go out for works .they may work at home .they may go shopping at home .the student may not goto school , their class may be held at home .do anything at home .so the needs of the cars will be decrease .on the other hand , the population of many countries is decreasing .so that , after 20-years , the needs of cars may decrease .otherways , the working groups of citizen also need to spend money for the eldery .next , the capacity of cars are increasing day-to-day .they may carry more people and goods .that will decrease the numbers of the cars .for examples , 60 years ago , there was no double-desker-bus in the world .nowadays , the road is full of double-desker-bus .the development of the technologies can decrease the demand of the cars .according to the reasons i mentions above , i think that there will be fewer cars in use .perhaps after 20 years , people will be travelling on foot for heathy life !
