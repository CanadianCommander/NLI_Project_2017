on the one hand , i can not but agree with this statement .indeed , according to me , learning facts and being capable of remembering them all does not prove that a student is clever .it is only a memory exercise , a kind of training for one s brain .students are not dictionaries , and i think we do not have to learn stupidly series of facts .on the contrary , showing that you have understood the key concepts of a lecture is a real active process .it shows that you have assimilated the lecture and it is the most important thing for a professor in my opinionwhat is more , learning facts is very boring and repetitive to me .it is something unpleasant i have the impression to do only in order to get a good grade .and most of the time , if this learning is passive , we forget almost everything on the day after the test .that is why to a certain extent i dislike history courses : there is too much facts to learn .i prefer reflection about history with concepts and ideas as tools .unfortunately , we have to admit that some fields of study like history require to learn facts by heart .that is why , on the other hand , learning facts is an unescapable step for students , especially freshmen .in many fields of study , knowing a minimum of facts by heart is an obligatory background for larger studies and reflection .obviously , we can not seriously deal with specific subjects without that very background .to a certain extent , the facts learnt are the matter and the ideas and concepts are the tools .the two work together and it is up to the student to take the most of them .as a conclusion , even if learning facts is something very unpleasant for most of the students , we have to admit it is an obligatory step .we need a minimum of matter to go further in what we are interested in and to develop a personal reflection on subjects .maybe we could develop new ways of learning facts which could be less boring , more attractive and that students could enjoy such as active discussions with professors , with specialists . ..we could sometimes leave our books aside .
