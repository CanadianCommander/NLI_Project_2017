it is a controversal problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not .differnet people may make different disscions acroding to their backgroud .some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music .but acroding to my own personality and backgroud , i can not agree with them .i think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .reasons and evidences are listed as following .the world now , unlike 100 years before , needs man who only know one subject .it needs people can have a broad knowledge .for example , the engineers now ont only need to know about engineering , but also need to have the ablity to use computer .because most of their works are completed on the computers .so if he is only a specialist about engineering , he will not finish his work prefectly .forthemore , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choose for the future .it is hard to say that a student majors engineering will become an engineer after his graduation .it is common to see students in college change their majors .but a man only good at one subjuect will not have the free to do so .as the most morden buildings are the mixture of music and painting .a specialist is the man who soecializes in more than one subject .the famous english detecter in the noverl are good at detective and music .such examples can be seen during every day life .a man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so .though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing .but i think a capable man can benifit from his wide interest , for his interest will finally help his to do achieve in his major
