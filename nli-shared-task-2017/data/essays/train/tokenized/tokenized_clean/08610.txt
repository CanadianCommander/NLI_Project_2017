students who learn to understand the methology of a certain process have enough capacity to quickly identify and solve a problem , eventhough changes were done in the examples used to explain the new topic .i agree with the fact that states that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is more relevant when a person solves a problem by understaning every step done , than by following all the process by memorization .for example , a mechanical engineer student who is taking the course of statics has a better probability of getting better grades if he understands all the main concepts of the class .teachers explain the theory in problems very different from the ones utilized on tests .so , when a student only learns the facts about the stresses applied to an object with certain geometry , he will not be able to answer the problem if the teacher changes the geometry of the object on the test .the student should be able to understand how to apply the related concepts in any given situation .in my own experience , i can apply this statement to one of my hobbies , playing golf .two years ago when i started practicing this tricky but fun sport , i needed two take classes every week .my teacher always remembered me about the importance of doing the movement , `` swing  , thinking on it , not just doing it automatically .this concept helped me a lot to understand my mistakes during the swing .so , this left me the reflection about understanding every step of the movement and not just doing it mechanically .after some time of playing golf , i learned that when you just learn the facts and do not analyze them , you start repeating the same errors without identifying them .as a conclusion , this two examples showed the importance of understaning ideas and concepts over just learning the facts .understanding the concept give you the ability to easily recognize any error .
