in my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people .this is a very evident fact and can be said based on reasons .firstly , younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people .young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment .while older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude .older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lays ahead .so , younger people many times enjoy themselves by taking up risky sports like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing .secondly , the phsical conditions of older people does not many times allow them to move to different places and perform many fun related activities .while the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get less tired .so , they can enjoy by taking up sports , long country tour and other similar activities as a source of enjoyment for themselves .also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the changes in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoos , playing games on computer and using various eletronic items like i-pods and mp3 player .lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy as much as younger people due to other limitations .older people have many responsibilities of family , work and society on them .so , they are not able to enjoy themselves as much as young people who are free from these responsibilities and have much more time to enjoy .therefore , it can be said that due to carefree , flexible and risk taking nature of young people it is possibe for them to enjoy more than the adults who are less flexible and have much more responsibilities on themselves .
