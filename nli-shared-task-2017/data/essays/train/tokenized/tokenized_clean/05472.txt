in today s world , successful people try new things while others doing what they already know how to do well .i agree that successful people always try new things in other to succed .because people need new information and important to get new things .first of all , if people never try new things how can they succeed in their business .one of my friend s mother has her own food store she always try to find new information and think about how can increase customers more and more .even though she already knows how to do well and what to do well .i think that is why she can keep her own business seccessfully .second , these days technology is amazing and increasing so that means people make a lot of new things and find new things .every countries are getting change in these days .in my opinion , sucessful people always try to find what is the best way and good .and then people can succeed perfectly .third , if people doing what they know how to do well , that is not enough and must be failed afterwards .every one know how to do well .however , it depends on how much people can try new things and make good in order to succed .it does nt matter that how to do well .my friends is also succed her own business when she tried to find new things .this is the one of the good way if one does nt want to fail one business .threrfore , i totally agree successful people always try new things .then they will succeed .
