ideas and concepts are more important because if students understand they will learn more information and is easier to a student to understand the class if they know the principal ideas and concepts .the principal idea and concept of a topic make easier learning for the student .because they do not have unuseful information .firstly , tacking into account that all the students have to learn more information about the world , they have to understand what the teacher is telling .so they have to learn understanding only the principal ideas and the principal concept of the topic .if they try to learn all the thins that the teachers are telling they will not understand so they have to learn only the main ideas and the main cocept of the topic .secondly , all schools would have only preparated teachers because there are a lot of schools that have very bad and not preparated teachers .preparated teachers know how to transmit the information that they know to the students , but they have to transmit it in an easy way to the students .they have to resume all the topic becuse the student only have to learn the useful thins that are only ideas and concepts .finally , teachers in all the world have to preparate theirs selves to teach better the students because the students need new concepts and new ideas to grow intelectually .as a final analisys , preparated teachers have a lot of forms to transmit information to the student .but they have to give only the principal ideas and the principal concepts of that information to make easier the understanding of the student .but also students have to put a lot of attention in the classes that the teachers are giving to learn the new information that the world has on this days .
