i m in complete agreement with this sentence , because i can experience this problem in the city where i live .nowadays young people are too busy in school and afternoon activities like sports and music , so that they have nt time ( and sometimes no desire ) to help their community ; it was different not so many years ago , when boys had nt the same opportunities to keep their life busy with enterteining activities ; for this reason , although many of them had to work hard since their childhood , they tried to spend their time with some friends in activities which helped thier communities .as i said before , i can experience the lack of children s partecipation in the life of the community in my own city .for example , in occasion of the annual festival for the saint protector of the city , each year the inhabitants of my city organizes a big festival ; actually it s a good one , well organized and joyfull , but the problem is that since i could remember it has always been the same , each year the same kind of festival as the previous one ; well , i address the cause of this `` routine  to the fact that no young people join in the organization of the festival , so that a great source of ideas and renewment are nt used .but it s only a small example belonging to my own space of life .anyway i could find more significant ones ; i mean a bigger problem of distrust that young people feel towards society and a consequent absence from its life .more and more people are nt interested in political life of communities anymore ; and a proof is that the political class of today has an average age very high ; there are no young boys who has the fervour to enter the political life and bring a new young fresh air of renewment .
