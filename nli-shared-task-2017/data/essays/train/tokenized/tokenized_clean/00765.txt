i disagree with this statement because it s true that is necessary for students to understand better the concepts and the ideas showed from the theory but i think if students do nt learn facts and do nt learn the way in wich all facts are produced and could be solved , they are not well preparated for the daily life and for taking the work they are studying for .now i m going two show two examples about my life in order to support my theory .i m studying business at politecnico of milan .all courses that i have done during my bachelor degree and also courses that i m making in my master of science , spend so much time for showing ideas and concepts and not for presenting facts .in one bachelor courses called ect ( economic and technological changes )i have studyed a lot of theories , for instance the theory of monopolio , porter s theory about the four forces that are important in the regulation of enterprice s business , but our professor spent less time on the cases , on the reality .the result of this course was that all of the students were nt able to solve a case studies and were nt able to solve a real problem .i had got the same problem also in my mos , because all the subjects that we have to sustain in order to take ours master degree provide only for a teoric preparation based on concepts , ideas but there is a great gap related to the understanding of the facts .for instance , three days ago i have done an exam called econometrics that is statistics applyed to economics .but there were only models to write but nothing related to facts .i think that for students , learning concepts and ideas is very important , in fact if they do nt have a great theorical base they ca nt give brilliant solutions to solve any problems .but also is important that they learn facts , the way these facts are produced and the best way to solve them .
