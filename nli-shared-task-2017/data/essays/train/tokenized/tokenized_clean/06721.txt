i totally agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better that htey really are .first of all , the objective of the advertisements make the sale of products increase .in order to do this , advertisements emphasize only good points about the product and not mention the bad points .for example , when new small car is realased , in the commercial , it is enphersized that the car is affordable , but they do not mentin the capacity is really small because the point is not attractive for buyers .also , we can see that many advertisments overrate the products or hide something behind the value of products .for example , in the advertisement about exercising machine , they mention how much effective the machine is .but often we can see the comments like , `` this is not typical result  or  you have to control the diet  .consumers can not notice these comments because these are written in very small prints .additionaly , popular movies stars or famous people in the advertisements attract people .in this case , they trust the fame of the stars , but they do not check the products well .even though many people that know they should not be tricked or they should look into products themselves , the degree of tactics of advertisements are very high .
