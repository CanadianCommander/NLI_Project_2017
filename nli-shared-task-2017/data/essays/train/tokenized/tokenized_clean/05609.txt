advertisement is a very important part of business nowaday and the aim is to sell .if you turn on the television you re most likely to fall on commercials and this is very specific of the united states .i do think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .just by the lightening , the way it is shot , food looks systematically better on tv or in picture than in your plate .there aim being to sell , they are not going to tell you that , in a month , your new vacuum cleaner will be broken or that it will leave dirt on your carpet .they want to show the best feature of the product and highlight it to the extrem .the problem is that sometimes commercials lie and that things should be defined and ruled because when you invest money on a product and expect a lot out of it , not because you are demanding but because you have been promised something , you are in your costumer s right to demand reparation .it seems like there is no rule in advertisements and that lying has become a common talent but i do think that this type of practice has its dark side .in fact , anyone can tell when a commercial is over-selling a product to the point where it gets obviously and ridiculously outrageous .few poeple are actually fooled by these .we are aware of it and have come to find it rather funny .but does this gives a bad image to the company and the product ?i do think so .i have a tendency to think that they are not serious with their costumers and therefore i am not interested in buying such a product .if the first answer to `` do advertisement make products seem much better than they are ?  was `` yes  i would give it a second thought and say that the ridicul of most of them totally diminish the work and the money spent on what is suppose to make the product look good .for me advertisements fail at that by failing at taking poeple serioulsly .
