nowadays , oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thwenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .we will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future .on the one side , petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable , for instance because they are under big cities .moreover , governments are developping tube , train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute less .for example , lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in paris .on the other side , the population of third-world countries is growing , and at the same time , lots of people who were using the bike in china are considering bying a car .futhermore , lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent .for this reason , it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour .besides , scientists are considering developping cars with hybrid motors , which rely both on electricity and oil .it could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil .for the moment , those cars are puchased above all in japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countries of the world .to put it in a nutshell , the issue of the cars is rather an issue of oil supply .till hybrid cars are not very fame , the number of cars could hence decrease .however , it would rather be the case in big cities where people have other ways to go to work .to my mind , twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can as often as today .
