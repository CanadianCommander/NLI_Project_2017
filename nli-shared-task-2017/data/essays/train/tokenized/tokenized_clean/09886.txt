advertising in modern century is widely using in all media , such as television , radio , newspaper , internet .in some cases is the only way to make money for the owner of media .the most time in a tv show in dedicated to advertise product than should help you in choosing among products .but not all product we see in tv or listent to the radio seems to be what they really are .for example , to product something you had to research the problem you want to satisfy , the way you want to proceed , make it physically and then let the people know what are you selling .but in some cases i think that advertising show to the public what they want , not what the product do effetively .in most of cases there are better product than this but , because less budget of advertising , they could nt be advertised .this kind of product generally cost less than the first one , because it do nt pay advertising .for an example , mp3 players most advertised costly effectively more than the anonymous one at even quality .the cost is a great part in a product s choose .i think people art stupid .if the product is nt of enougth quality , people can see at the first time , and they can do bad advertising to friend and other people .the better way to advertise-at first time-is the opinion that people have about it .
