the taste of each age is unique and certainly different .the things done at different ages are certainly different .however , a generalization can not be made on the degree of the enjoy taken from these things .young people do not enjoy life more than older people do but the ones who have the deepest love does enjoy most .the amount of enjoy can only be measured with the smile on a face not with the number of the lines .a young boy might be happy with watching tv but it can not be claimed that this boy is happier than his grandfather who tries to get up the stairs one by one for half an hour .it is a great pleasure for him to still be able to get up .from the other side , for the boy it is also a great pleasure being able to watch tv instead of working .the satisfaction is important at this point to criticise the enjoyments .to get the highest satisfaction what to do is , to do what you do with the greatest love you can have .on the other hand , appreciating brings the enjoyment .one with an enormous wealth might not be happy because money is not probably the one he enjoys .in order to be happy , one needs to appreciate what he got or what he does .otherwise , not being aware of the things he had , noone can love living .by this way he starts to love himself then love life and the rest of the world .loving brings enjoyment .to be able to enjoy the life , one has to appreciate what he got .the enjoyments are certainly unique everyone gets .young people do not enjoy life more than older people dobut the ones who have the deepest love does enjoy most .ages does not determine the enjoyment rate but the amount of love towards what is done does .the characterization should not be made among the body ages but should be done among the soul ages .
