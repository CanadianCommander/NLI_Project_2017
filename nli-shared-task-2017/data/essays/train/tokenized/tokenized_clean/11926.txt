i agree to the statement but i do nt think that this idea it s good .the successful people do nt try new things and do nt take risk because they do nt want to do a wrong impression to the other people .in fact the successful of a person in many time is due to the other people idea and to the other people impression , and a person that just have the success do nt want to destroy it .in accord to that a successful person do nt take a choice that is not sure , and do nt make an action that can to pooring his position .that is not bad in all .in fact in modern times is very difficult to have successful and is not easy to take a decision that can change all that you do in your life .but on the other way if you do nt take a risks you can not to growth your success , that because when you try a new things you take same risks but on the other hand if the new things it s good your success can became bigger than before .at the start of a life a person have nt success yet , only during the life your action makes your success .the successful people in the past has take risks that to have success .in general i think that only taking a risks you can do something in your life , and if you try new things you can find a new matter that you can do very well , and this give at your success a power to large it .it s true that try new things is not simple but i think that a person can to search the best everytime and everywhere to enlarge his successful .we do nt have many good things if same brave people do nt try to do that and do nt take the risks for their actions .
