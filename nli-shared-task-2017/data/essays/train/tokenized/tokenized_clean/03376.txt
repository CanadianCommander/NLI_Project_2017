i think that a young person enjoy life more than an old one do .a child have much energies to spend in play , in fact he experiences the world playing .in contrast an old person prefers to be quiet and avoids to move if he do nt need it .a teen first wants to discover new things , he increases interests , he falls in love , he starts the way to become an adult person .differently an older person remember what he did and could become a savior .in reality i do nt think that the difference is the enjoiment of life , indeed a person can appreciate life if he wants , but the topic is the quality of life .a young person lives better because is more sane , dynamic , courious , stronger than an older one .i am twenty-two years old and surely i should enjoy life more than an older man , but i think that a child should be better than me in enjoying life in the same way .though this comparation depends from the range between the ages of the two people , i am sure that a young person enjoy life more
