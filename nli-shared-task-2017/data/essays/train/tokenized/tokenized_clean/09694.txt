the question put forward by the issue is that , whether the succesful people try new things and take risks than doing the already know one .the issue is very important becasue success only comes when their is an effort and risk .i believe that sucessful people do new things rather than doing what they already know .the first reason of my belief is that , success is the house of the people who take some risk in their life and people be successful when they have accomplished new things in a better way .for instance , issac newton a great scientist the world has ever known did not sit quite after his success in the gravitational theory .instead he moved in other field of physics which is newer to him and earned laurels in all the new fields he has taken .furthermore , doing the things which are already know is not termed as discovery but it is development .and discoveries are more appriciated than development .trying new things turns us to be versatile genius consedering the success in the field as the next part .lastly , i believe by trying or exploring new thing can lead us new discoveries or new thesis .for example , when galileo discovered pendulum , he explored to the newer feild of astronomy and discovered telescope and declared the previous thesis layed was false by his new experiments .this shows that exploring in new thing is greater and more advantageous than labouring on the same know ones .ultimately , trying a new thing is more beneficial and appreciated than laying on the already known things .iam on the side of trying newer things because newer concepts are always intresting than the known boring ones and the search of newer ways , things or new ideas is always rewarding .so i agree that sucsessful people try new things and take risk for further success .
