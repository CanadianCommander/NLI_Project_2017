many students hate to study , because it s boaring , yet when the students realize the ideas and concepts .at that time , the studing will be fun .the ideas and concpets affect to students , grab the interesting , to understand what they learn , for unsing the ideas and concepts in our life and outstanding it .the ideas and concepts are very important to students for learning school courses like math and science .many students hate to study because it s boaring , and they do nt have interseting .however , when they know ideas , and concepts , they will ahve interesting .for example , jason has son , he is 5 years old , jason want to start teach him simple math , but the son does not have interesting and not good at math .one day , jason see the advertisement , `` most impotant thing is ideas and concpets .he call to that educational company for helping .after two moths , his son interset in the math , because he understands ideas and concpets .therfore the ideas and concepts are impotant to student to learning .students should know what they are learning , if they do not know what they are learing , the reason is they do nt understnad the ideas and concepts .for instance , when we are evaluate the math questions in the class , however the students do not understnad the question , because they do nt know the concepts .thus , the ideas and concepts are impotatnt for understading student s learning .the purpose of learning is to use in our communicatio or society .for example , james and kyle , they both listen geography in their high school .yet , james understnads the idea and concpes of geography ; kyle just memorise his text book .after they graduate , they live in same village .oneday , the earthquake comes suddenly in their village .at that time , james survive from the earthquake , because he understnds the ideas and concpet of erathqukae for his geography class .however , kyle gets serious injury , because he does not know the ideas and concpets of eathquke .therefore the ideas and concpets is very impotant for student learing material .we agree , the ideas and concpets is important to understand for students .for theses three reason , grab the intersing , to understnad what they learning , and for using in our society .when we realize how important is ideas and concpets form these three reason .we can understnad the ideas and concpts
