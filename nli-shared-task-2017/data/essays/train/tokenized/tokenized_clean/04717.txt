i agree with the idea that successful people try to new things and take risks ratehr than only doing what they already know how to do well .there are some reaosns to support my opinion .in the begining , most people may consider star players , like baseball player , as successful people .i guess that most famous players try new things and take risks to improve themselves .for instance , japanese baseball players wish to play in the united states because they think the us is the number one baseball country .such as ichiro suzuki on seattle mariners , he left japan and went to the united states to try to reach the summit of himself as a baseball player .he said `` i want to improve my baseball  .if he continued to play baseball in japan , he would not take risks rather than play baseball in the united states .it is so difficult to be a star baseball player in the us rather than in japan because there are so many popular foreign players in the us .in other hand , there are mostly japanese players in japanese professional baseball league .i think people are educated or improved by taking risks .in my case , i came to the united states from japan three years ago because of my father s job .my father said to me that `` you did not have to come with me  .my father worried about that i would be troubled with foreign language .however , i came here because i want to improve my english skills .in the first year of my staying in the us , it was horrible .i could not understand almost all words what teachers said .i was so depressed ; however , i really wanted to become a good english speaker although i have to take much risks or i need tons of effort for that .right now , i hope my english skill is improved by living in the us .thus , i believe that i will become a successful person in the future by taking an active part of my experience in the united states because i take much risks while i stay in the united states .therefore , i agree with the opinion that successful people try to new things and take risks .
