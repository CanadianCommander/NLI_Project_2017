i agree with the given statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .successfull people adopt a very good approach to doing things well .they have more self-belief and confidence that their new ways of doing things will definitely be correct .such people believe that it is thrilling to do things in unusual ways .they do not believe in adopting the same conventional ways of doing things right .they find it rather boring and stereotyped to do things they already know how to do well .they believe to take the path less travelled because they find it more challenging to explore such unknown things .such people are more adventurous , daring and dashing by nature .they do not fear the chances of failing when taking up activities that involve lot of risk .one best exaample that can be cited is of christhopher columbus .he braved the rough seas to discover the continent of america otherwise we would have never known that such a continent ever existed .he made this invaluable discovery during olden days where the methods of navigation were devoid of the advancements in technology .all great inventions like the wheel , telephone , electricity , paper etc have been possible only because their inventors took huge risks and faced several challenges in accomplishing them .it is said that necessity is the mother all inventions .people who have made great inventions and discoveries had felt such a need which was combined with a burning desire to make inventions to satisfy the need .but all this would not have been possible if such people did not have the fighting spirit to overcome all obstacles they would have encountered .hence successful people always believe in doing things in unconventional ways wherein they dare to face all challenges that come in their way .
