i am definitely not agree with the idea that asserts older people can not enjoy life as young people do .i will explain my reasons of course .first of all , i believe that older people know a lot about life .they have a lot of experience about life .this gives them a very significant advantage on doing the right things .it means that they can do the proper things to enjoy .they do not vaste time to see if something is enjoyable or not .because they know what is fun , they will just do the things they like .second , although many people believe that older people does not enough energy as young people , this is not something totally true .if an older person take care of herself or himself then there is no need to worry about .older people can do anything that they want , provided that it is safe .of course some things may have some risks , but do not forget that the young people also have these risks .third , enjoying the life does not need to have the same meaning to everybody .different people like different things .it is not something releated with age .while some people may find the literature as enjoyable , some other may not .for example , i am not crayz about football , but my little brother is getting mad at playing and watching football even just seeing the players .on the contrary , despite my love of literature , he has no interest on this .there is not a generation gap between us .there is only two-year gap .in my opinion it reveals that age is not important to enjoy something .if a person wants to enjoy something , he or she will definitely find a way .to sum up , as i tried to explain above , i do nt think that age matters in enjoying life .it is not the age that making the things enjoyable or not , but characters of people that makes the world enjoyable .if you want to enjoy the life , take my word for it , there are limitless opportunities to do so .it is up to you .
