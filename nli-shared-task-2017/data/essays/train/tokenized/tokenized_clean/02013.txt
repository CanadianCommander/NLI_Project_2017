i strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of two reasons .first , older people had already enjoyed their lives when they were young .second , older people can still enjoy their lives .before my grandfather died , couples of years ago .he used to tell me about his life when he was young .he used to tell me all his stories about ; his girlfriends , his adventures and his passion .but , he cleared me something , he told me that he still enjoyed his life .this is a clear example of how much older people enjoyed their lives and they are still enjoying it .the time of enjoyment is like two or three times longer than what we , young people , have enjoyed .therefore , it all sumarizes that older people enjoy life more that young people do .as mentioned before , older people are still enjoying their lives , some young people would say that , older people can not use the internet or go to an amusement parks like them .but , that is completely wrong .i have a friend , whose grandmother plays computer games with him .i could not believe it until i saw her playing with us .my friends grandmother likes going to amusement parks too .last summer , we went to wonderland together , it was simply amazing !here , we can see another example of older people enjoying their lives .in my opinion , if older people are healthy enough and strong enough , they can do whatever they would like to do .to sumarize everything up , i disagree with the statement and i think older people enjoy life more than younger people because older people already enjoyed their lives before and they keep on enjoying it .
