majority people see a lot more advertisement .some people say that by seeing the advertisement , they are judged whether they are good product or not .howerer , when this topic comes to me , i firmly believe that advertisement has a lot of drawbacks .advertisement fosters a instant consume , and a lot of company adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive model payment .i n addition , through an advertisement , people do nt think which product is good or not .to begin with , advertisement fosters a instant consume .when i came to new-york , i was really interested in victoria secret advertisement , which made me buy a lot more its products even if i had lot of innerwears already .i could not saying that the advertisement was the worst thing for me .what is more , a lot of company adapt famous actors and actresses with expensive payment .even though , the price of product is pretty cheap , we have to pay its advertisement fare invisible .we would be pay more expensive price , considering quality of product .it goes with out saying that advertisement is really disadvantageous .finally , people do nt think anymore which product is good or not .especially , the youth prefer to get specific products , such as nike , cocacola and ipot ( mp3 ) , etc .they want to have some products that the famous actor or actresse advertise although it costs a lot of money .these event may cause social problems .i may well say that davertisement is harmful for the youth .to sum up , as might expected , advertisement has many shortcomings as i have mentioned above .
