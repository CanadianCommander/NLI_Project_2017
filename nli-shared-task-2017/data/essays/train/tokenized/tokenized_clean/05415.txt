i do nt agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .we watch tv , listen to the radio , or watch internet everyday and while we watch tv programs , listen to radio programs , or watch internet website , we often see or hear numerous different commercials that explains about numeours kinds of products that the company want to sell to us .although some advertisements are really exaggertaed and give false information , i think most advertisements provide us with correct information .the advertisements we often see during the commercial break on tv is the car advertisements .when it comes to a car advertisemt , it shows us the outside and the inside look of the car and provides us with the engine information , safety information or warranty information .there is no way for the car company to exaggerate or lie about their cars .because for example , if they lie about their car s safety , they can easily get sued or prosecuted by the government .there are also electronic wheel chair commercials too .the commercials tell us that teh electronic chair is safe , useful for elderly people and also has warranty .now , is there any way for the companies to exaggerate or give flase information about the wheel chair .absolutely , no .commericials of the comapnies that sell mechanical products are mostly not exagerrerated and therefore , consumers can rely on them .also about pills for headaches .those pills just work fine and they are not exaggereated .if they do nt work , the comapny would not be able to sell their products in the first place because the government check their products before they sell .therefore , i do nt think that most comercials make products seem much better than they really are .
