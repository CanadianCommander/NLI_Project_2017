i absolutely agree that ` most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i confront the bundle of advertisement on the tv , radio , bus , and even along the wall and on the road .the food in the advertisement loosks more eligible , so i feel that i have to eat that .how about the facial cosmetic ?its effect is significant so that i ca nt resist to try it .the advertisement of diet is incredible .it shows even the pictures of the ` before  and ` after  using their products .is it real ?i do nt think so .the answer is clear if you use those products .i tried foods , cosmetics , and ` incredible  diet drugs .nothing is like the advertisement .i mean that the food does nt taste great for me to make a smile , and the cosmetic that i chose among the advertisements did nt give my face enough moisture .as for the drug for diet , it really did not lost my weight .far from my experience , the people around me and my neighbor gave the similar experience to me .there is no big change such as the advertisement .even the surface of the package is nt like the contents in the view of color or shape .how shame on them !i m so sensitive consumer to try the weight of the purchase on the scale .it did nt match exactly .i showed the case of exaggerated advertisement based on my own experience .in order consumers  to make a right decision , it is important to show the way the products are as well as to deliver the consumers  report to the public .
