this is a conversial issue about it is better that learn different aspects than to specialize in one specific subject .depengding on personal experience , personality type and emotional concern .we may find that some people hold the idea about learn broad knowleg ; on the other hand , some people might choose learning in one specific subject .the answer , nevertheless , is not easy to make , with all aspects carefully considered , i deem that former one is more reasonable .the essential reason that why i agree with the above statement is that learning different subjects will make people have more experience when he iis in the trouble .a good case in point is the affair happened in my hometown last year .some students in my hometown decided to have a trip in desert , before they went , they prepared all the thing .however , they met the problem in the second day , a girl was sick because the bad enviroment , the madicine they took is useless .when everybody did not know what to do , a boy who study botany used the mothed he studied in the extra class to save the girl .so , learning extra subjuct is a sensible choice .another reason can be seen by every one is that learning broad konwledge will make people know more friends .take different class will let you know more classmate , and it is important that the friend will help you when you be in trouble .the case is not isolate , it is typical of donzens i have heard .althought different views about this topic is exist , i still vote for learning broad knowledges .although the merits of learning one specific subject is recognized , it is evident that the drawbacks is far outweigh them .learning one subject will make people boring sometimes , it is not good for people that always think one aspect .so , with the evidence offer , i will choose learning different subject as my opinion .judging from all evidence offered , we can draw the conclusion that have extra knowledge will be good at both experience and making friends .so , to be frank , i strongly commit the notion that studing broad of many acsdemic , but not only one subject .
