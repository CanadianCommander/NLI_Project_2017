i agree to have a speicalized knowledge on a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .according to me , when a child is brought in a school and later to higher secondary school , he is taught all academic subjects which will lead him to a better understanding of this world .after attending the school , a student has a broad perspect of different subject knowledge with him .now a student is capable of using his knowledge which leads to exploration of new ideas in his mind and setting a specific goal of his life .the student thinks of a particular subject as his interest .he develops a penchant for a particular subject .it is in the interest of a student that he works for a specific subject because he will be a adroit and astute student of that subject .a student therefore plans for his masters in that subject .he turns out to be a appropriate person for that specialized subject .he later on joins research on that subject and he achieve his goal .according to me , nobody in this world has capability to master every subject in this world .even scientists like galileo , einstein , newton , etc. had their own interest and specialization which led to different discoveries in this world .it implies that if everybody in this world have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then world would be a boring place to stay .there would be no innovation around and it would be tasteless .the versatility of this world would end at its very early age .there a so many living examples who has supported the idea of having a specialized knowledge on a specific subject .from sports to politics , businessman to adventurers , there so many people who lives their life for their dreams and their goals .one of the best living example of my time is mr. amitabh bachchan .amitabh bachchan is an actor of bollywood industry .he has did his bachelor in arts and joined bollywood industry .recently , he has been awarded with the bachelors of performing arts .the ectasy which amitabh bachchan would be having after achieving this degree would be immeasurable .i support specialization on specific subject because its brings you immense happiness when you fulfill your goal of that subject .considering sports on the other hand , football legends like ronaldo , pele , ronaldinho have specialised in their skills and therefore they are at the peak of their career .i would conclude by writing that specialization on a specific subject needs high interest in it and hard work to achieve the goals .a person would achieve more fruitful if he is specialized in a specific subject than a person have a mere broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
