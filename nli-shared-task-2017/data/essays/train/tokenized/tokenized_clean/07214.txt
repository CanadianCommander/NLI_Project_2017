is attend a group led by a tour guide the best way to travel ?different people might have different answers .in my opinion , i totally agree that attending a group led by a tour is the best way to travel .the reasons why i think so go as follows .to begin with , attending a group led by a tour guide is more relex because i do not need to work hard to arrange a tour by reference many materials about the the tour such as the weather situation about the journey and what is the traffic conditions .in addition , i do not hve to design the tour .finally , i do not need to drive in a long trip , completely relexing myself to enjoy the trip which led my the tour guide .therefore , i can save the energy and just follow the instruction of the tour .in addition , by attending a group led by a tour guide , i have many oppertunities to make many new friends who have different backgrounds , such as coming from different areas or different countries , having different cultures .in addition , i can enjoy the nice talkfinally , by attending a group led by a tour guide who have many experiences about the tour , i will get a lot of knowledge and information from the knowledgeable tour guilde and from group members who have many information i have never known .therefore , attending a group led by a tour guide is a great idea and i like it .
