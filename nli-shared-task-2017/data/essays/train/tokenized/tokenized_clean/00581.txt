the purpose of advertisements is to present a product or service in such a way that the consumers would want to have it , and have it immediately .accordingly most advertisements would make the products seem much better than they really are .there are thousands and thousands of products and services being promoted in advertisements .however not all commodities and services are needed by the consumers , at least not all of them .but advertisements will be presented in all media like newspaper , tv commercials , street signs as if it is for all mankind .all the advantages of a product are being highlighted , whereas nothing will be mentioned about the weaknesses , which definitely would exist .for example , insurance company s selling piont is the efficiency and complete service whenever there is a claim after a car accident .but in reality , there are always complicated paperwork to complete and a long process for the claim to be approved .sometimes a client has to go to different departments and doctors  offices to get verification .the promotion of a soft-drink will also emphasis how good it is to a thirsty person and meet needs for energy , etc. whereas how soon a person would get thirsty again and the side effect will not be mentioned at all .some commercials will do comparision between one product with another brand .for instance , laundry powder that would clear stains of all kinds totally and quickly , whereas the type from another manufacturer will not do the same good job .but they would not let the consumers know exactly how the experiments was conducted .many advertisements use famous people like sports figures , movie stars , singers , or young and attractive people to draw people s attention .these commercials give the false impression that once the products are being used , the consumers will become like those in the ad .manufacturers should be truthful in promoting their products and government should impose regulations and policies to protect consumers .
