live youngsome elderly , despite less active and energatic than youngers , enjoy life more than young people do .in these cases , the older people need a right mind -- use their experience to view their life positive and optimism .since the older people are usually retired and stayed at home , they do not need to worry about the depressions and difficultis from work .at this time , if they have an positive view upon the world , they can learn more about the world using their free time .for instance , an old people who had to give up his/her dream to travel around the world because they have to work all day long , can achieve his/her desire to experience the colorful and various aspects of the planet he/she lives in .this person , inspite of his older age , likes his/her life better than he/she lived before .as one s age increased , one s knowledge and experiences also increased .if the elderly use their optimism view to contribute the world , they can enjoy a lot more than youngsters do .when i was young , my father was only an unsignificant engeernearing assistant in a small company .but as he suffered more experience and learned more knowledge , he began to looking forward a self-improvement .he went to a graduate school and took a phd program around 40 years of age .although no one in my neiborhood thought he would finish the course , he equipped himself with his optimism and experiences and overcame all the problems he faced .and now , he is enjoying his life as a physics professor .maybe one can say that youngsters have more energy than the older ones , but the older people have some particularly strength -- the knowledge and experience .if elderly use their own power to view the world right , they would feast their every minute and enjoy their life .
