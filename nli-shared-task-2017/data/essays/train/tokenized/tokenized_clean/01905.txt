i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .the inmature attitude and the strong ability to get involved in activities make the young people beable to enjoy life more .the young people are often willing to do some new things to make the life more interesting , while the older people are oftne afraid to try things that are unfamiliar to them .for example , young people like to wear fashionable cloths and drive fancy cars which are really cool for them .on the other side , older people such as my parents who are much more conservative .they often consider those cool things inmature and inappropriate .they always tell me not to buy those weird cloths away and spend more time on my school work .wearing those cloths makes me feel special and i can compare them with my friends .however , there are few older people wearing cloths like teenagers .also , young people are able to do some excited activities that older people are afraid or not able to participate because their body conditions are not as well as young people .for example , i consider skiing the most excited and enjoyable sport in my life .it is fast and it does not hurt much when i fall into the snow .however , everytime when i invite my dad to join my friends and i to have a skiing trip , he refuses because he does not know how to ski at all .although i try to convince him that it is easy to learn , he is still afraid to try .in conclusion , young people are willing to try new things and participate in some excited activities which older people are not able to do because they are old and have different attitude from young people .
