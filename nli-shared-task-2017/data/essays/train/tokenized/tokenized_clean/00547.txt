the statement propose could be considerate correct in some cases but incorrect in others .the two possibilities rappresent two kind of ideas , and the use of the first one , in opposite of using of the second one is different case by case .i prefear to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject .the motivation of my personal choose is the strong possibilities rappresented by this opportunities .if you are the best in an argument you will be called everytime someone need help on it .an example is the use of computers in general .in my university group i am the best in using of computers and when some friends of mine have problem with computer , he ask me how he can to resolve his problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too .they call me because they know i am able in using computer and they call me only in this cases .i am able also to resolve maths problems , but my friends never call me to resolve this type of problem , because i have some friends of mine more able than me to resolve this kind of problem .i use this example to demonstrate that if a person want to decide of use the second sentence he must be shure of to be very strong in the argument he choose else is better choose the first sentence .the first sentence get opportunities for whom is able to organize himself .the knowledges of many academic subjects permit of use everykind of knowledge in all type of academic subjects .is not easy do that and i think this kind of possibilities is for few persons .in the end i can say that i use specialize myself in one specific subject , but i am not agree with second sentence , but i think everyone have to choose the best opportunities for himself .
