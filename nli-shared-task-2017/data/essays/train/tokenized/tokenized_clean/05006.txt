many companies spend a lot of money in advertisment .also , they have special section and skilled people for advertisments .all these to market them products to customers .in my opinion , i totally agree with statment that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are for three reason .first of all , any products in the world have advantages and disadvantages .the best product is that has many advantages and few disadvantages .in all advertisments , only the advantage of products is seen but the disadvantages is not .if person see advertisement , the product will seem much better than it really is .second , most companies use multimedi - text , sound , picture , vedio - in products advertisments .these combination of technology will put the product in the suitable environment that will effect on the custome .for example , if you would like to buy a television and you see advertiment about two kind of television .first one using multimedi that shows the television with high resolution and you best program and best actor on it .second advertisment without using any technology .i think you will select the first one because you think is better even though if the first television an dsecond television are same in features .finally , many companies contract with beautiful men and women or with famous player or actors to present in advertisments and use products .if you see product with your favorite player or actor , you will buy the product even though it is not good product .inconclusion , i totally think that products have less quality than they are appear in advertisments for three reasos .only advantages are presented on advertisments , companies use mutimedi in products advertisments , and companies contract with famous people to present in products advertisments .i think , we have to be accurate before buy any product especially if we see it in advertisment .
