whether or not successful people try new things and take risks is a complex issue .while someone might argue that only doing the the things what they already know how to do well provides them a lot of advantages , it can also be said that trying new things and taking risks can lead them to way of success .both sides of the issue have advantages and disadvantages but i think that trying new things and taking risks is the better choice .first of all , at present we live in a world where every thing is getting harder day by day .it is getting harder to go to university , if you can go to universtiy this time it is hard to find a new job for yourself .furthermore there are thousands of people who does almost the same things as you do .that is , if you are a bank worker there are thousands more bank workers who do the same things as you do everyday .at this point what differ you from the rest is your courage .if you are strong enough to take risks and try new things u can open up the way of success .forexample maybe you borned in a farmer family and grew up in a rural area however it is not your destiny to be a farmer if you are strong enough to choose the way of studying and working hard you can open up a small company and be the boss of your own company and maybe you will have chance to be a boss of a huge company which trades with thousands of firms from allover the worldlast but not least , life is a risk on its own .nobody can know that what will happen a minute later .therefore , we can not predict what can happen as a result of a decision we make .we are the only one who can be ended it .while we spend enough energy and time over the steps we decided to take we can be successful at the end .forexample , you can start with a bussiness of trade if you really work to achieve something there is no reason left for being unsuccessful .only u have to work on it hard and do not give up against the problemsoverall , i think that successful people try new things because they know that clear u can not reach the top with the things everybody does .trying new things is the key of the way of success .
