it is often said that knowing a variety of subjects is better than concentrating only one subject .some people might disagree with this statement because they believe that specializing one major can help them to be more successful .however , i strongly support the idea in the statement since having a lot of knowledge is very useful in one s life as well as helps students to study better .to begin with , studying many subjects is very useful .it is no secret that we live in a complex society that is consisted of many aspects .therefore , you can use your broad knowledge during your life .a shining example of this is one s hobby ; even though your major is business , for instance , you would probably enjoy your hobby such as listening to music , going to the gallary , etc .if you have a broadened knowledge about these things by taking a music or art class , it will be helpful to you when you enjoy them .therefore , it is obvious that various subjects can be used many times .it is also true that many subjects have something to do with each other .it is especially true because there is no independent subject in the world .in other words , all subjects are linked together .here is what i have seen myself .my major is languge .however , i am taking not only classes that are my major but also one physiology class .in my major class , i study about human s brain that is related to ability to speak .also , in the physiology class , i learn about haman s brain , too .this is an evidence that language and physiology are related subjects .given this , a lot of subjects can help one to study one s major better .in conclusion , i firmly believe that it is more important to have a variety of information in many subjects than only one major .that is because it is useful as well as improves your study .therefore , if i can , i want to study more kinds of subjects in the future .
