i agree that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .there are too many factors which stop young people from helping the communities .the young people learn to grasp what they do not at hand and search for what they want to do .these factors leave them solely care about themselves and only deal with their own personal tasks .first , living with the great pressure to get higer degree ends up less and less time for the young people to leave thier leisure time for the communities .young people tend to focus on their acdemic field achivement rather than their communities .thus , they spend great amount of time studying or explore the acdemic field so that they will get great degree and be qualified to pursue for their future job .second , with the advanced technology in this changing society , young people are more likely to be attracted by media or other information resources .these leave the young people less time to care about the living area communities and prompt to searching for other entertainments .hence , young people will spend more time on theier own leisure time entertainments and try to relax after their daily work .in a word , the rapid changing society prompt the young people to live in the moment to fullfill their dreams first .with the growing pressure left for them to compete with others result in less and less time they devote to their communities .for the rest of the day left from their goal pursuing mission , they would be more likely to settle down to relax and rest to save some energy for the next busy day .those problems they face in the reality lead them to solve their present situations and cause them only have time to think for themselves rather than others .in the long run , young people get used to their daily tasks and they become more likely to neglect others things which may not be necessary for them to deal with .
