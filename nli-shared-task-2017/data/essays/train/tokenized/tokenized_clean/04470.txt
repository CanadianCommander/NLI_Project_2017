i think helping students to understand ideas and concepts is important .that is not the only way about how to teach students .the other idea is teaching them to learn facts .students may get many different ways of education when they start to learn .no matter the educators are the parents or the school teachers , the different ways will influence students so much .lead students to understand ideas and concepts is a very important way .this way will help students to learn how to think .if teachers teach students to understand the ideas and concepts of one topic and teach them to think those concepts more detail .students may use various kinds of ways to realize that topic , like finding information from the books or discussing with other students .students will develope the real thinking in this process .this way even can help students to develope their creations and also learn how to use the good interaction with other people .the other idea is teaching students to learn facts .most of parents or teachers usually use this way .they will tell students which is right and which is wrong directly .students knows the facts of everything they have learned .they always accept what they learn .students do nt need to think too much .that will cause students ca nt differ what is the truth if no one tell them the facts or when they face what they have nt learned before .that will be a very dangerous way to educate students .i think the good way of education is teaching them to understand ideas and concepts .students may really know how to learn more and can think everything independently .
