i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .in today s society young people spend a lot of time in front of their computers , watch television or just hang around on the streets .not many are interested in what is happening around their little world that might not go further then their room and computer desk .from my point of view , young people should be more concerned about other people in their communities , especially the elderly .by helping for example in nursery homes or places for disabled people , adolescents learn to respect people that are different and in need .they need to realize that they might be in need as well when they are older and how essential it is that there is help for those people .many young people in our society suffer under a lack of motivation and do nt have any goals in their lifes .by supporting projects like building a new public playground they learn how good it feels to accomplish a goal and work in a team .in many cities , children are aggressive and randomly distroy building , playgrounds or other common sites .by building something by themselves , they learn to value things and to respect other people s property or belongings .for many years , my church group and i organized local flea markets to support the nursery home and other social institutions .it not only helped me to find many good friends and build a strong relationship to the people in our community , but the happy faces and wide smiles of the people who we supported i will never forget in my life .when children become part of a community , they learn to respect other people and get satisfaction by achieving something .they get compliments by adult which gives them confident and the feeling they are accepted and not treated `` o
