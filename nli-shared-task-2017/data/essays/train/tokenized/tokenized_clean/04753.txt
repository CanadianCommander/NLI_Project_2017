i agree with the statment , advertisments make the products seem way much better thay they really are , acctually many times one feals cheated , as you realice the real characteristics of a product you just bought .i think there are three main kinds of false statements that are usssualy done about products .they make you think you need them , as far as i know we do nt acctually need all the things thay they promote , this is easy to observe on tv comercials , ussually it tourns out than they have just invented something that makes a work that you never do , realy easy to do , well great but i never do that any way .the second common statment is , that their porduct is able to do some incredible things , needless to say that most of the times they do nt do anything outstandinglly differnt from what their lest expensive subtitutes do , i have a perffect exaple for this one , ther was a tv sales show , like ten years ago , that claim they have developed glasses that can help you see as an eagle , i mean it is good enough to be able to see as a normal human , and by the way that is a stament that we will never be able to prove ether right or wrong , therefore many people found themselves disapointed by their new sunglasses , because at least they did nt do what they expected , i am not saying that anyone liked them anyway .an other typical disguise is to make you belive that you might acctually become a better person , in many sences , by consuming their product .lets say they are tring to sell you a car , they display a picture of a young , athletic , good looking guy , sorrounded by a group of beautifull women , i can assure you that buying the car will not make you look like him or make you sudently irresitable for women .or how about the mp3 players advertisments > they make young guys think thay they will fit better on their social group if they own one .finally i have to recognize anyway that there are some exeptions , but not many .
