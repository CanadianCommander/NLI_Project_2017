the use of cars has been rapidly increasing day by day .this is because of its convienience and prices which have gone down .most of the middle class class people are also able to get the car because of the prices and discounts offered by the manufacturers .once car has been a luxury but now it is a common mans vehicle .its become easier way to move around and convienient for many to go .in the coming twenty years the rate of cars in usage will be more .i completly disagree with the given state ment .the usage of cars when compared with the past times has increased three times .and when the prices are going down there will be increase in number of car usagers and numbers of cars in usage .cars are more convinient to travel and more number of people can be accomodated at a time .when comfort is coming in a lower price and in such inexpensive manner people are going to make use of the comfort .inpresent day it self a medium class man is able to take a car , in the coming years the bikes which are used now will be replaced by cars .once buying a car was rich mans choice .the price was high and normal man could not effort to get it .but now it has reached the common man .in an other twenty years its going to be a need rather .all the bikes will get replced by cars .so in future there will be a boom for cars and there will be increased number of cars when compared to present .this might cause some negative effects but people look for convinience and easier way for transportation which is the general tendency of people .
