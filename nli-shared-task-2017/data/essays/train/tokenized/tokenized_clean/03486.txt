when considering this issue , some people agree that it is better to specialize in one specific subject while others seem to agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .as to me , i agree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .currently , in this democratic and economic-free world , we need people with variable abilities no matter where they belog .people who are used to working alone may be disliked because every work seems to be created by `` coporation  in today s society .`` coporation  means respecful and multi-cultural .only through it may human beings create a better consequece of their work .therefore , it is not the matter how much quantity one can contribute to the group but quality one can produce by his own , even that a little bit but precious knowledge , which suddenly occurs to his brain , may come to a significant key to success .i remembered one time we classmates had a huge project to be done , something related to `` fantasy literature .we were terribly nervous about that presentation because finally we decided to talk about the great volume , `` the ring of the king .we spent a week for preparation from searching to powerpoint .actually , only two of us had finished the three books , and others just `` tried  to understand some episodes .however , we did make efforts to use variable angles to do analysis , especially when we began other related books reading .so , when the day of the presentation was coming , we group not only had full preparation about the main top but also some materials developed by our extra reading stuffs .through this experiece , i realize that it is not matter how much you have learned but what more you can possibly give out , which is being developed and potentially erupted by individual efforts .therefore , in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
