young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .this is undoubtedly true and i would absolutely agree with it .today s generation have become more hardworking and sincere towards their carrer .there is so much of competition that the young generation is just so busy preparing themselves for a better and more secure future .there is so much of competition that one does not have the time and energy left to support their communities .they find it very demanding to support their very own survival that they feel it will hamper their future if they invest time in supporting their communities .one example i would like to mention here is that a friend of mine who use to be always busy supporting his community found that people started exploiting him and taking undue advatage of his goodness and kindness .he felt that he was putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis .infact one day while he was helping a member of his community , that member said this line `` god helps those who help themselves  .he told him son start helping yourself first by doing well in your academics and then help your community .that day he realised how far his friends had gone in life and how much of effort he will have to make to shape a good future for himself now .one really does nt know what life lie s ahead of him or her and to secure their future they concentrate on their work .that is why young people of today s generation do not give enough time to helping their communities .
