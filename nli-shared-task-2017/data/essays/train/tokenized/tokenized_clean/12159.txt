there are different opinions about what is best method in order to prepare students .according to me they could be associated to the school systems of two countries , italy and the united states .some people sustain that it is more important for students to have a theorical preparation based on ideas and concepts , than a pratical preparation based on facts .a reasons in favour of that opinion could be that a student has to learn the techniques of a job before practising the job itself .another reason could be that with a theorical preparation a student will always be able to learn and develope by himself new concepts and ideas .on the contrary other people affirms that it s more valuable for a student s career to practise activities ( such as stages , trainings etc ) instead of reading them just theorically .in fact in many situations students study at school a lot of things that seem to not be useful at all when they go to work .in my opinion learning facts is the best way to prepare a student for his future job , especially when he is at university .for example i disagree with the italian university system that obliges students to study books of thousands of pages instead of providing them with some real work experiences .i think in this way students would forget almost half of the information they study just the day after they took the exam .in addition , when they will have to look for a job , farms often say they lack of experience .consequently i prefer the american university system , where students have less to study but they do activities that make them become familiar with their future job .however i have to say that in some cases theorical preparation is important , for example in order to provide the student with a good general culture ; and in this way i think italian university system is better than the american one .in conclusion i believe that a student should have a very good preparation based on facts ; but it would be important for him to understand ideas and concepts in order to improve the techniques of his specifical job and also his personal culture .
