generally speaking , the purpose of an academic education is twofold .firstly , it prepares students for the labor market in a particular area .since most students pursue careers outside academia , this is not a trivial purpose .secondly , it should prepare students to conduct effective research applying the state of the art research methodology .thus , both purposes of academic education should be taken into account when discussing this subject .in effect , a broader knowledge of many subjects will necessarily require students to focus on the broader concepts instead of the details .on the other hand , studying subjects more in depth will allow a student to absorb a significantly higher amount of detail , at the expense of knowledge outside the area of specialization .it has often been argued that such in-depth knowledge of a subject area and its details is not beneficial , because of a phenomenon colloquially called `` brain overflow  .as we acquire new details , we forget the details we have learned in the past .however , research has shown that the brain is not a container with a fixed size that can only contain a limited amount of knowledge .rather , the process of learning and remembering itself expands the capacity of the brain .thus , there is no clear cut limit to the amount any one person can learn and remember .looking at the labor market implications of this issue , it is important to note that especially in knowledge based professional services , the degree of specialisation is increasing .therefore , generalists tend to be in less demand than specialists that are able to cover one subject area in depth .similarly , contrary to popular belief , it is still factual knowledge which allows people to put new information in context .only those who have a sufficient amount of factual information and a thorough understanding of a subject will be able to process new information .on the other hand , most people would agree that while the exact limit of the brain s capacity might be unknown , there must be some limit to the number of data one can remember .in earlier times intellectuals like j.w. goethe had actually read all or almost all books published in the three main languages at that time .this is drastically different today .since the knowledge in many academic subjects doubles every ten years or so , it is impossible to keep up with this pace by going into subject specific details .scientists thus are condemned to become generalists to some extent .it is also important to understand that it is the very ability to learn that might be the most important result of an academic education .acquiring the ability to quickly identify the most important questions and then to absorb new knowledge is more important than accumulating large amounts of `` dead data  .it is not only the knowledge that differentiates graduates from non-graduates .it is also their ability to learn and process new knowledge faster .all this would favor a more general knowledge of many subjects .in addition to this , on today s labor market , most jobs require constant adaptation to new developments .the speed with which we are able to adapt to new developments might therefor be more important than the mass of knowledge acquired in the past .i would therefore favor a stronger focus on general knowledge of many subjects rather than an in depth focus on one subject .
