` it really works  this is what i can hear every commercial .every products are not best in the world , and sometimes it does not work .however in the commercial every goods are fabulous .in my opinion , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than their real .advertisements exist for advertise the products .even though , the product is really good .there is a limit of until everybody know about this product .because of this reason , people want to make commercial .for instance , near my school , there is a really delicious restaurant .almost every my school students know about that restaturant .we get imformation from our school friend .however , my friends whose are not attend my school , never know about that restaurant .the other day , the restaurant itroduced in famous tv show .after that the restaurant is all the time crowd .even my another school friend know about that restaurant .the restaurant has a purpose when they are on the show .it need to provocate customers .many people buy products that they do not need after watching commercial .the advertisement need to stimulate to customers .owner of products wants to sell products as many as possible .getting to result , they need more strong tihings than their real products .therefore , they make their products more fancy and looking good .if it works products can earn lots of money .when i was young the castle for doll was so wonderful in tv commercial .i keep asked to my parents to buy that castle .finally i got that , however it was so different from the commercial product .colore was different and there was no bell and it was not automatic .even though commercial disappointed me , it was enough to make me buy doll castle .in conclusion , most advertisments make ptroducts look good better than real , i think that advertisment has a purpose .because commercial s initial work is advertise to people and via stimulate customers make them buy to products .
