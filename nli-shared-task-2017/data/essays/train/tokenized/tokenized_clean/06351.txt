given a choice to choose between a self organized tour and a tour where are tour guide leeds a group of people , i would choose the first one .i would like to have my tour focus on my interests rather than the general interest of people and so having a tour guide will prevent me from doing it to some extent .tour guide may make things easier but reduces the fun of exploring on your own .in a tour various people would want to spend varying amounts of times on different parts of the tour .i prefer spending more time in more parts of the tour , less in some and even skip a part that is covered under the tour led by a guide .in a guided tour i am restricted to follow the schedule and plan decided by the tour guide .since now there is plenty of information available at different sources ( e.g. television , internet , magazines ) , i can use that to plan my tour based on my own preferences .other than that , i prefer to explore places to a much more extent than a specialized tour guide would keep it restricted to appeal the majority .i would rather learn about the places i am supposed to visit and wo nt restrict myself on the main tourist attractions .i would rather be a part of each and every minor thing that is around that place .in the trip i plan , i prefer to visit lesser places but spend more time on each place .i think that in guided tours , it is more like glimpse of what all is there to explore .some people may have lack of information or time to plan tours properly and tour guides make their jobs easier .but just for the sake of taking out the effort from planning and managing my trip , i would not give away the main interests that i look for in a trip , as i have already discussed above .considering all the factors , i personally do nt think that to travel in a group led by tour guides is the best way to travel .
