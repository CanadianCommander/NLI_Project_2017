i disagree with the statement .i think it s so hard to decrease the number of cars and it takes more than twenty years .i will describe my main ideas .first , it is true that there are many people who go to their offices or schools by car .they use cars because they do nt have any other ways such as trains or buses .the solution for this problem is to construct them more .if the govenment does it , cars will be fewer , but it takes a lot of time and cost .in addition to it , i do nt think that the government take an immediate action for that .second , actually cars are convenient , especially if you live in a rural area .people who live in a rural area , for example , ca nt go to the supermarket by their foot , because it is too far .that s why these people have to use cars even if they do nt to want to .the solution for this problem is to built many stores in a rural area , but it is not easy and realistic .as long as there are rural countries , cars will not be decreased .third , there are many works which need cars .for example , carring goods from manufacturing companies to stores .they are forced to use cars , because they have a lot of things to carry .for these reasons , i disagree with the statement .
