the best way of travelling with a group of people is very funny and i really enjoy that trip .actually we do nt know the places we are going to visit at that time we really need a person who guides us .but we are going in a group at that time we do nt want a guid .in our group some people knew about the place , and someone in the group have some information about the place then no need to worry .for example , i went to hawaii with my friends , in my friends group one girl already visited the hawaii and she knew the place which is more beautiful and which place we can really enjoy and she also knows some resturant .at that time we went to hawaii and we really enjoyed the trip .we do nt need any guide .if iam going alone at that time i really do nt know the place then i need a guide .if i can not take a guide then i wo nt enjoy the trip .but in my opinon i enjoyed the trips when i went with my friends in group .group trip with friends is really enjoyableand i could still remember those trips .for example my home twon is in india , one time i went to agra to see the tajmahal .that is really a beautiful place i do nt know anybody in that place at that time i paid to a person who is guided me .and that person is very nice he showed me all the places around the tajmahal and he is also stated telling stories about the tajmahal and i like that information he gaved me .that is also a nice thing about a guide .that time i did not realize that i came alone .either of the ways we go with friends or we go alone what is most important is we really enjoyed or not .
