many consider traveling to be one of the fundemantel value to develop your point of view in to the world .traviling alone sometimes can be hard for people .on my part , i agree that travelling with a tour guide has more benefits than travelling individually .with a tour guide , youn can safe time and recieve more information .on the other hand , traveling without a tour guide gives you freedom .first , safing time is really important when you are on the trip .by a tour giude , you can schedule your time .for example , in trips , there are some schedules which offer a lot of place to visit for visitors .in this schedule with a tour guide visitors can see many places in one day .they have a chance to visit many places and see onin addition , when people travel to somewhere , they would like to learn some information about the place .with a tour guide , receiving information is easy for visitors .for example , in foreign countries visitors have to translate some information which is about the place .people do not have a chance to translate all foreign languages .a tour guide can translate the information for visitors .hovewer , depending on someone sometimes feels visitors boring .when people travel to some places , they sometimes want to feel free .without a tour guide , they can do whatever they want .for example , they can go shoping , visiting some places , eating their launch or dinner whenever they want .to sum up , travelling with a tour guide offers many advantages for visitors .saving time and getting information are really significant things to travel .
