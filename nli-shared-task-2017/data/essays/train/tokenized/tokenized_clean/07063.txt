i partially agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .being young genereally means that you are single and dont have much responsibilities on your shoulders .young people show great interest to experiment with various options they are given .they show enthusiasm with lots of energy .older people also enjoy their life but in other ways .these ways are very different from that of the young people .they enjoy their work , home , children , and if they are retired from their jobs , they enjoy each and every moment as they spent their entire lives earning , taking care and doing their responsibilities .however , being ready to experiment sometimes could be very dangerous .young people in a mood of being too enthusiastic to do new things , may fall prey to drugs and other illegal activities .having no responsibilties makes them a kind of free bird which can make young people reckless in the work they do and also be harsh and insensitive towards fellow beings .sometimes having no responsibitly makes young people not to take things seriously about their personal and preofessional matters , which eventually leads to depression and sometimes life threatening .older people due to their age , failing health and other reasons may not be that optimistic about going and doing an outdoor activity .most of the old people love to go to museums or go to a picnic with their families or play golf .young people usually prefer to go to pubs , trekking and some adventurous games and places .they prefer activities which are risky and also challenging .however , i feel that it is all in one s heart , what you feel about yourself , what you want and what you can do .because your age is what your heart feels .
