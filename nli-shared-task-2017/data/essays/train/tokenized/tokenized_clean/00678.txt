i would disagree with the statment , the reason being is that it would lead to nothing except confusion .having a general idea about various subjects is preferable rather than persuing full time study on all the subjects .a student who prefers to study all the subjects will have to work much harder than the student who has only choosen specialization in one subject .specialization in one subject , will have a clear idea as to what to persue next with regards to that particular academics and could plan for a better career .even career opporutunities would be good for the student who has specialization .let us take an example of med-school students .one student decides to take cardiology as the specialization and other chooses to study many specializations .the student who chooses cardiology will have concentrate totally on the specialzation which he chooses and can be a master in that specialization .this student can work in corporate hospitals which are related to cardiology .on the other hand the student who chooses many specializations will have to work really hard and to get on top it , it would be very difficult for him and some times it may result that he ends up with nothing .this person will have hard time in choosing his career field as well .the above example clearly states , what would be the advantage of specialization and with that of knowledge about many subjects .even if you look at the students of business administration , you would see that they will choose either one specialization or dual specialization , but not more .even the schools and colleges would give a over all idea of the various subjects and then it will be divided into specializations .even the person who would opt for broad knowledge of many academics will have to be specialized in one particular subject at the end of the day , since he/she needs to choose a career path which leads to a specialization .the statement looks better to read on the paper to have many academic subjects , but in practical it would be very much tough to acheive it , although there are people who are persuing many specializations , ideally it would be suggest to have one specialization .
