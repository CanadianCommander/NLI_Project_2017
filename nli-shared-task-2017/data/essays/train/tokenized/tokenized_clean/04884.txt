some people agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .however , i disagree with the statement for the following reasons .most importantly , ideas and concepts are tools for people to make facts clear and simple .in other words , ideas and concepts are not necessary if there is no facts related to the concepts .for example , unversity students in a department of counseling should learn a lot of concepts and ideas for the treatment .specifically , there is one important concept , which is the reciprocate theory of self-disclosure .that is , people are likely to disclose themselves , when others disclose themselves to the people .this is a conceptual theory .however , though a lot of practice sessions the students conduct , they gradually know that there are many cases where the concept can not be applicable .in other words , even if the counselor discloses herr/himself , the client will not share her/himself .at that time , students should learn that there are many exceptions which concepts and ideas can not apply to .as shown above , students need to learn facts first and they also should know ideas and concepts are tools which help themselves to see the facts clearlly and simply .additionally , facts are more persuasive to students regarding to learning .as i mentioned above , students study many concepts and ideas for the counseling , such as person-centered method and cognitive method .however , sometimes , these concepts do not help students understand what counseling is because of the abstractness .then , knowing and learning facts help them understand important things more convincingly .for example , the students sometimes visit clients homes and have an interviews with the clients .at that time , students may see the facts .that is , they will find that the main cause of the depression comes from the terrible family relationship or the main cause comes from their past experience they want to forget .these facts which the students will find will be more persuasive to students and the students will be able to know and feel what the counseling is , what the counseling can do for them , and how the counseling works .in other words , facts a more persuasive to students regarding to their leaning .in conclusion , some people agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .however , i disagree with the statement for these reasons .
