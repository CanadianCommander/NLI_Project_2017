i desagree with that statement .i have some reasons .first , if we travel in a group with tour guide , we can not go where we want to .i want to visit some place any parson has not visit or there are few people .i have been to philippines as a volunteer .when i was there i could not go where i want to , because i must have worked .i think it is similar to group traveling .also , i prefer to talk with a person who has different culture and opinions .if i travel in a group , there is no chance i talk some foreign people .i want to spread my view about everything .i think that traveling by mysefl is good chance for talking with many different people in the world .of course , there are many kind of people in my country .but i want to see someone who can not come to my country .third , i think it is good for us to think about place where we will visit .by thinking of unknown countrys or citys , i think we can learn the counrty or city naruraly .so i like traveling
