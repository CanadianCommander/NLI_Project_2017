to answer this question , we must carefully look at the advantages and desadvanteges of either a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a broad knowledge in one specific subject .let s look at the major advantage of broad knowledge of many academic subjects .if one has a broad knowledge of different academic subjects one has the power to draw connections between different academic fields which often leads to very creative solutions for complex questions .in a world that gets more and more complex this is a very important skill .however , broad knowledge has also a big disadvantage : it is obvious , that the knowledge of every single academic subject ca nt be very profound , because usually there is not enough time to get a broad and profound knowledge about many academic subjects .on the other side what s the major advantage of having a specialized knowlegde in one specific subject ?if one has a very profound knowlegde of a specific academic subject one can concentrate fully on this subject and try to get more knowlegde about this subject .one has the possibility to push the science on this subject forward .one can develop new modells and solutions on this specific field .that would not be possible , if one tried to get a broad knowledge over many academic subjects .the most important disadvantage in specializing in one specific subject is the lack of survey .there is a big danger that one get lost in looking for a solution , that could have been found much easier by taking a glance of other academic subjects .one stops to look over the boundaries , which can be very helpfully - as pointed out at the beginning .looking at these advantages and inconvienients i am drawing the following conclusion .because the world is getting more and more complex it would not be intelligent to just concetrate on one of the two possibilities .in my opinion it is absolutely necessary that in academic fields there is a good combination of people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs but also of people who specialize in one specific subject .that is the best way to encounter the multiplen and complex questions and problems of the future .
