it is not better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .it may cause a huge problem because if a lot of person know a little about many subjects , how do they teach something in detail about a sepecific subject to another ?also how do people become a teacher with this little information ?how do knowledge can improve with a little information about a subject ?that is why it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .lets consider that there is a little population in a small land and they know a little information about every academic subject like geography , biology , history , physics . ..etc .with this little knowledge it would be hard to determine geographical characteristics of the land , or species that live in the land and their differences or similrities .even it will be hard to now what is a specie or it would be hard to know about their history and it will be hard to put things on a road in the future .so , that will helps to the population to destroy themselves more quickly .on the other hand , imagine a land which is full of people who have a well knowledge about their one proffecional area .with this proffecion they can teach their knowledge to their children or the ones who wants to learn about the subject .the difference between this example from the previous one is they will know much more information on a subject and that will help to develop themselves more quickly .in conclusion , as i said and support the idea with the examples before , i believe that it would be more effective when people have one proffecional area than to know a little about a lot of subjects because it will help them to improve themselves and also to have a well educated population in the land .
