i think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .from now on , i mention two reason for my this opinion .the first reason is because modern society or companies search for the person who is specialist .recently , society is becoming worse in a sense of economy .there are many companies which can not manage .so society or companies need a person who has special skills or knowledg .the second reason is because i think the person who has a special knowledge is strong in many fields .if specialized , you can get various occupations .you will be cherished by many besiness persons .to have special knowledge change you as specialist .so you will be strong .in conclusion , i think it is important to specialize in one specific subject .to do so , your ability will be higher and higher .
