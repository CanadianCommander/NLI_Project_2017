in today s world , a successful individual is someone that has achieved a goal in his life , who s happy with what he has accomplished , with what he owns and has reached a high level of well-being .everything seams perfect , but this also raises a question : can a successful person desire more to what he already has ?will he try to have new experiences and take risks ?i believe there can be two answers to this question .first of all i must agree with the statement that a successful man is going to search for new accomplishments and experiences because otherwise his existence becomes meaningless , and his journey through life would become repetitive and boring .a person eventually adapts to what he owns and to the situation that he lives in and is suddenly going to expect new things to occur , and wish for new events .i believe it s in the nature of man to desire new things , a man is always trying to satisfy his desires and when they are indeed satisfied , he ll have new desires .it s a cycle .however i can also disagree with the previous statement because trying new things and taking risks depends also a lot on the individual s character .i believe a man has to be confident with himself and his abilities if he wants to try new adventures .he has to be courageous and responsible to take risks .in conclusion i both agree and disagree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks .
