on an economy that is based on the selling of products , going from restaurants , to technology products , to simply grocerys or even real state .to try your best to sell a product is understandable .and nowing that traditionaly on many parts of the world , people will buy products not by the way they taste , of they work , but by the way they look or simply because that is the `` thing  to buy .myself being on the restaurant bussines , i ca nt say that i agree or disagree on advertisements making products seem better than what they are .reason being that i find myself on both sides of the statement .i definitly agree that you have to sell a product for what it is , and do nt hide anything , or lie to your customer .but how do you do , when you are trying to sell the best product on the world , but it just does not look good enough for people to buy .i identify myself with both sides of the card , on one side , i am the costumer , and i want to buy a product , that do exactly what they do when they shoe it on the adverstisements , i want to go a 5 stars restaurant and get a 5 stars treatment , and a 5 stars food .on the other side of the card , i understand , that if you need to sell a product , you have to find the way to make your costumers buy your product .there is nothing wrong to try to to be succesful , as long as your advertisements stay as close as possible to the real thing .and there is nothing wrong either to ask for what you paid for .as long as the costumer understands that sometimes adverstisements are going to picture thing as they are not , people are going to try to push things as they are not .
