i think that in a certain way you can learn more from places if you go with a tour guide but probably will not be much funnier than going with your friends .also if you go with a tour guide you need to wake up at an specific time and be at that moment in the place he told you or if not you will missed that trip .i think that if i want to travel to a place i will need to analyze for what purpose i want to go .if i want to go only for pleasure or if i really want to know the turistic places and their history .probably i will decide to travel with friends but i will go to the tourism offices to get information about the touristic places of the city and select which places we like the most and visit them .if the place will require a tour guide we will pay for it if not we will only enjoy the place and the moment .sometimes going with a tour guide makes you feel bore because you can not go to eat or sleep at the time you want because you need to finish the program he have .but for example if i go to a city for few hours or only for a day i will choose to go with a group led by a tour guide because probably if i go by myself i will not have enough time to visit many places and know the city .in other words i can say that if you want to stay for many days in a place you can go visit places that seems interesting for you and later pay for the attention of a tour guide to talk you about the history of the city .
