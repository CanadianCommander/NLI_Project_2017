as a student majoring in bussiness management , i definitely know how important advertisement is in selling a product .however , this does not mean that advertisement increases the purchase in a right way .for example , it is not allways possible to find a product in the way that you saw in the advertisements , many times we find it worse than we thought .thus is because the manufacturers tend to show products  properties better than they actually are .first of all , it is common that most firms deceive people about the function of the product .they try to show that their products serve extreme performance .a very good example of this is slimming products , such as diet products .i want to express something that happened to me recently .in the television i saw the advertisement of a new product called `` diet patch  .it was stated in the advertising that after a person uses diet patch she would not feel hungry .consequently , she would lose 5 kilos in two weeks .as soon as i saw this advertisement , i bought this product and started using it immediately .after two weeks , while dreaming of loosing five kilos , i could lose only one an half kilos although i did all the things that were said in the instructions including the diet .secondly , in order to make customers buy their products , most of the firms demonstrate the appearence of the product extremely better than they actually are .the most common example of this is the advertisements that are related to summer holidays such as tour organizations or hotels .last year we wanted to go to a hotel for our summer holiday .thus , we searched the newspapers and among various hotels we decided to go to a hotel which has 2 swimming pools .the picture in the newspaper was so lovely that we could not think of any other hotel .but , after we went to the hotel it was a muddy pool .finally , in order to pursue the customers the firms make advertisements that show their products better in ways such as changing its fuctions and its appearance .
