since i am a business student with focus on marketing , the topic is very relevant for me in my everyday life .first of all , i have to say that there is no doubt about the effects advertisement has .using several tecniques to present a product in the best possible light , some of the consumers may get the impression that they do not receive the complete pieces of information about it and a realistic picture .however , although there may be some tricks to sell products more effectively , no single marketing man in the world has magic abilities .to start out with some arguments that support the above statement it should be mentioned that print media especially offer opportunities to give the product a better image .most important are possibly pictures that can be turned into perfection easily with computer programms .additionally , the information given in newspapers or magazines are in fact putting special emphasize on the product s qualities instead of its eventual disadvantages .to give an example , a special feature of a mobilephone such as the great design or the modern functions would be probably printed in big , coloured letters while the expensive conditions of the speaking tarif would be printed in small letters in a corner of the page so that most readers would pay no attentin to it .another trick of advertising professionals is to work with people s emotions .awakening positive feelings by showing impressive and colourful spots with a certain connection to special situations in life , the associations with the product the watchers have and therfore his opinion about it would be more positive than without having seen the commercial .as one can see , there is a diversity of ways for selling a product in a maximum of positive light and although there are a lot of norms that refer to ethical and moral doubts in the society about modern advertising methods and that have to be obeid , companies know how to make use of little tricks .i do not completely agree with the statement because , as i mentioned at the beginning of my essay , the product is only a product that can be `` tuned  in some way but not really improved in the impression it makes .additonally some ethical and social norms prevent people from being tricked seriously by ad
