this quotation about successful people is not an easy question and i do not have a ready-made answer .on the one hand , i think that it is true that successful people try news things and take risks .indeed a manager who decides to set up his own businness takes risks .he is not sure that his shop or company will be a success .consequently he takes a risk that he will not make money , whereas in the company he worked as an employee he was sure to obtain each month his wage .nevertheless , if his business performs he will make money easily .thus , the remunertation he will have is the conterparty of the risks the manager took .in my opinion , i consider that ambitious people are often the same who are successful .on the other hand , this affirmation might be refuted .indeed , sometimes people became popular and successful not because they took risks but rather because there were at the good place at the good time .it is rather a question of opportunity .why do not take into account the case of a son who becomes successful just because of he is the son of his father / he has done nothing but he is well-born .moreover , there are people who take risk but do not automaticaly become successful .then , if we analyse the case of a singer we can also criticize the quotation .the singer is famous and rich and everybody speak about him .however can we say that he is successful because of the risks he took / what are the risks in this case / as far as i am comcerned , i do not agree to recognise the risks he may have taken .then , there are also people who take risks in doing what they already know .for instance , the pilot or the driver of a bus take each day some risks because they may create a danger for the passagers .in a certain way , they are successful person .
