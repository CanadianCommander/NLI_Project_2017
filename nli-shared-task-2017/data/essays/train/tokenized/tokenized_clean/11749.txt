i agree this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .our common sense is not to try towad risk area .however , no try new thing means no new happening in our lives .as i read this statement , i remind the pastor cho  story who established the full gospel church in seoul .he started samll church in country side which lived many poor people .as his ministry grew , he moved a little bigger church .his church number was around 1000 numbers .god gave the vision to build a huge church which was available to participate in over 20,000 number .he did nt have money as well as huge space to build it at that time .he could nt see any reasonable things to start it .it was big risks .it might be worse if it influeced toward his church numbers because all elders of church number were not agree with his opinion .however , he began it against all environments and conditions .so some of church numbers left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harship for new church .but his church number became over 700,000 numbers becuase the location the church was bulit , became the core of city of seoul .all so important building such as the building the national broad casting and govenment , were established there .the other reason is that all most people try to do what he or she knew well .that means that there are so competitive in that area .if he or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others , it is rare to get success .let s think about one example .there are a lot of pizzah store in our area .many of us know how to make it .it is also not much risks for managing compnay because it is famillar for each of us .however , it is easy to make it as well as to be known how to do it .
