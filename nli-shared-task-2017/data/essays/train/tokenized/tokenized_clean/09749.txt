as far as i am concerned i think that the people in our daily society need their cars .you feel free if you can take the the car and go shopping for example .but you also see the deep impacts of the globalization .if everybody takes his car every day the nature will be polluted .so you do nt have to forget the nature .i think we will not have more cars in twenty years than today because i think that science and economy will find another transport type .the oil prices are very high today so i ca nt imagine that the car industry will increase .i think another transport type will appear like the transrapid above the buildings .another reason is that the world population increase and so i think there is no space anymore to provide all people with cars .do i guess that the natural resources are limited and so if there is no oil anymore you have to find a solution .maybe you can support the car with solar cells but this method will be very expensive .so in my opinion scientist have to find another way to bring the people from one point to the other point .the old traditional way to come from one point to the other point will discussed .if you ride with your bike to the university or you want to go shopping you will also support you health .so i can imagine that something appears helping the people to remain fit .our daily society is full of people having more weight than healthy .why we do nt connect two things .the health and the movement .ok , i am a sporting man and feel better when i ride with my bike to the next city .but who has the same thoughts that i have .nobody .the world is governed by people who want to live fast and who do nt have any time to relax .time is money and therefore i think the car industry does not increase but the world will find a solution to make the life easier for those dreaming of it .
