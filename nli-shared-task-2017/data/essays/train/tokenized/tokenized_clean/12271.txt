fist , i do nt agree with this statement , because if you would like to go a place where you are in a vacation in there , you may want to be a free person .on the other hand , you ca nt do everything what you would like to do in that time and in that place .but , sometimes we need a tour guide who introduce us the place or city where we are in vacation there , because some places where we do nt know howmany historical places it has .besides this , if you go to travel with your tour guide you may have some problems .for instance , when you would like to visit some historical places you ca nt choose where you want to go .so , your travel guide may affect to you .your travel guide everytime stay with you .you could nt have a rest with your family .the best one is , travel only with your family .next , there wiil be many people in your vacation .and most of them who you do nt see in your life or you do nt know how charecteristic person do they have ?this point is very important because , if you do nt know a person or people , you should nt go to vacation with them .maybe some of them are guilty , we do nt know eachother .and there will be a lot of problems with your group , if they are nt nice people .then , you could nt have a chance to choose them .i think if we could choose which person can go to vacation with us , it maybe possible to think go to vacation with a grup and a tour guide .but i never heard that you could choose your persons of group .after that , maybe in your vacation , some of your group s member would like to go to other places or would like to do different things , but you do nt .finally , the best one is everytime you should go to your vacation only with your family .
