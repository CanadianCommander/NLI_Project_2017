i strongly support the statement .young people play life more than older people do , because of these reasons .first of all , young people hav nt any probleme ; for exemple when the sun arrive the young people go to play game .second of all , young people hav nt some one to do ; for exemple the day when they hav nt school , young people prefer to sleep long time or to look at tilevision and over .also , young people hav nt a responsability ; for exemple if they hav nt give the house propretor money heir mather or father wlould pay from him .in conclusion , older people can not enjoy life like young people because they have a big responsability to do .
