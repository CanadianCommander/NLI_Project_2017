if people are asked , in an survey for example , who enjoys life more , younger or older people , one is likely to answer spontaneously in favour for the younger ones .this tendency might have its roots in the wide-spread oberservation which can be made in the today s society .but is this assumption right ?do younger people really enjoy life more than the older generation does ?it is true there are a lot of offers especially for younger people to create their free time .there are clubs and bars in every city where an older person would not really fit in .besides there are also a lot of new sports activities which are especially developed and introduced for the generation under 50 .you can hardly imagine a senior standing on waterskis or making a bungee jump , can you ?but can therefore be concluded that the younger people enjoy their life more ?personally i do not think so .there is also a great number of leisure offers for older people that are really not less amusing at all than these for the younger ones .for example you can find dancing events for seniors nearly everywhere .as the health system has improved extremely the last decades the older people are more healthy and fit than in former times .thus they are able to exercise a lot of sport despite their age .and they really do .the number of older members in sports clubs or gyms has increased enormously .older people also have other great advantages compared to the younger ones .normally they have more money and more time .most of them earned money during their lifetime which they now want to spend for their fun .young people , on the opposite , often still study or earn not really a lot of money at the beginning of their job .that s the reason why they often can not benefit from the rich offers .furthermore a lot of older people have already retired and now enjoy their new freedom and `` endless  time .finally i think the mentality of older people has changed .they are not longer thinking that only hard work can make them happy .they also want to enjoy the `` evening  of their life .as a conclusion i want to point out that in my opinion older people enjoy their life toexactly the same extent as younger ones do .
