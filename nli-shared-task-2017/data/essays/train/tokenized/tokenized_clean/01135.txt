the question of whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept that it is for them to learn facts is one of the very important issues which teachers , no matter the grade they teach is , should take into thier consideration .personally , i think that understanding concept is a more fruitful process than learning facts .the process of understanding concepts guarantees the application of understood concepts and ideas to varied life-circumstances and situations .it also gurantees a prolonged usage of the learned concept contrary to learning facts which may just disappear from our memories .learning concepts , in my point of view , makes a fruitful learnign process where learner can make use of the learnt concepts to reach great numbers of facts .if i teach you the concept of how and why people need to mix with each other and socialize , you can take out from this concept different facts about people , such as making friendship , getting married . ..etc .prolonged usage of knowledge is attained more , in my opinion , through learning concepts rather than facts .concepts stick in our minds and do not vanish easily from our memories .so , if i teach a student a number of facts , i am sure that he/she will forget some of them just as the class is over .however , although teaching concepts takes much more time than teaching facts , thier availability in students  minds last much longer .by the end , i strongly support the teaching of concepts rather than the teaching of facts as teaching concepts , in my standpoint , have much more effect on students  achievement and development .teaching concepts and ideas opens the door foor students to think actively and respond geniously to the events they encounter in their life .if we are successful enough in teaching concepts a more prosperous future is guaranteed for our syudents
