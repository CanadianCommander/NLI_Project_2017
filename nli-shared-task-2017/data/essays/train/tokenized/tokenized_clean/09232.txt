they say that those who win write history .however , it does not mean those who lose were not part of it .taking risks is a double-edged sword , depending on the ability of the samurai .a saying like this would drive a person to take unnecesary risks , without giving them fair warning that taking risks is serious business .back in my junior year business class , we talked about the risk-return curve ; which basically stated that the greater the risk , the greater the return .succesfull people who have taken great risks and in turn earned great return from it , can get away with rolling that statement around .it is a different tune for those who took the risk to high , and did not recieve a return .doing the same thing , is not entirley as bad as the statement makes it seem .sure , taking a risk once in a while is good , but perseverance and constance are also traits succesfull people posses .it gives those who depend on you a sense of security and stability , which is benefitial for any business .a healthy balance between taking and not taking risks is , in my opinion , a healthy adivse .more than anything , knowing which risks to take .being wise comes with experience , the same way the ability comes to the samurai wielding the double-edge sword .experience is aquired with patience , but also with a keen eye and an ambitious mind set to succeed .one must know when and where , but most importantly , why .in conclusion , yes , succesfull people take risks .but risks taken after deep analysis and gained experience .knowing when to attack , when to defend , and when to fortfeit is what makes a person succesful ; it is what guarantees the samurai s victory .
