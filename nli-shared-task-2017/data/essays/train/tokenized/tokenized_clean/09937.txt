`` the risk is my game  said james bond in a movie and i think bond is successful .the importance to improve myself is connected with trying new things and taking risks .i believe that successful people are the ones who try new things and do nt complain about wrong choices .instead of doing always the same things , trying a new one is risky : you do nt know what is going to happend , where you are going to be .but this makes people smarter and more intelligent .in a completely new situation , a person could improves himself and this makes a better people .i personally prefer to choice new things : for example at the restaurant .it could be a stupid examples , but it is fondamental .at the restaurant people is divided in two categories :the gamblers and the `` abituee   .the gamblers always try new plates , new food and that excite them .the feeling for a new flavor , new taste makes the choice both unaspected and exciting .of course there is the problem : `` what if the taste is not so good ?.but once you have choiced a new plate , you have to own the risk .the `` abituee  are the opposite of the gamblers : when they go to restaurant , they already know what they are going to take .they do not experience new thing and so they will not improve themself : they are too closed-minded to understand the thrilling of a possibility .the gamblers have much more possibilities to find the perfect plate for the perfect dinner .only with the experiments on new food , people could understand what they like and what they do nt like .i think this example , because it is strictly connected with life .successful people are successful , because they have risked and maybe they tried so new many things that , now , they know what is the best for them .
