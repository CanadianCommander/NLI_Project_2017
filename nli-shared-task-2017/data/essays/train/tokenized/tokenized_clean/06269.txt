nowadays communities are at the base of our society , which is made up of children , young prople , adults and old people .adults and young people are the most active part of our society .the statement ca nt be taken as an absolute , i think that it depens on the society in which we live .at different societies corresponds a different way of thinking .first i have to point out the importance of the education .as a matter of fact especially in europeans countries and north american countries , where education is a fact of great importance , young people are more involved in our communities in order to help them .it is a biunovocal relation as the more young people can help their communities the more can be both educated and help in their growth .there are some activities such as parish activities that inovolves young people .for instance i usually help children to sudy as a volounteer .that is a good way to help our community .nonetheless i have to state that in some delevoping countries young people have no much freedom and that causes many problems in the relation between communities and young people .moreover all people tell them what to do without giving them reasons .besides there is some young people who do nt figure out why they should help communities .this is due to the fact that there are egoist and they do nt like to help others .but it s not completely thei fault .there are different outlooks in the education of a person .one can choose not to force his son and let him stay all day in front of a computer or in front of television or one parent can make the choise of spend time explaning to his son the importance and the lovely sensation that hammer out in helping others , that i sto say in helping communities .in conclusion i support the idea that if it seems that young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping thier communities maybe it is because they had never seen adults do that with passion and love .so we have to own out our resposabilities and never give up in front of unforeseeable hindrances , instead we can change our outlook and we can share our sparetime with young people in order to focus togehter on the big opportunity we have to help our communities .
