certain persons think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .indeed , the understanding of ideas and concepts could seem to be more valuable , ideas and concepts implying abstract thinking and ability to have a reflexion disconnected from the concrete world .however , i think that learning facts is essential and more important for students than the understanding of ideas and concepts , for the following reasons :at first , for young students it is difficult to understand ideas and concepts .most of their work consists in learning facts , for example by naming objects and defining them ( a child will be shown for example a yellow fruit and he will learn that it is a lemon ) .therefore stating that ideas and concepts are more important would result in considering that most of the things you learn as a child would not be worth learning .such a position is not defendable .moreover , you can not be able to understand ideas and concepts if at some point you have not been able to learn facts .most of the time ideas and concepts derive from observations made with respect to facts .for example the theory of galileo about the rotation of the earth comes from observations he has made in the real world not only from abstract thinkings .as a result we may consider that learning facts is essential to the discovery of ideas and concepts .furthermore , facts may help people to understand ideas and concepts by illustrating abstract thoughts .as a result , if you are unable to learn facts you will not be able to understand ideas and concepts .at last , in certain fields , such as history , facts are essential to the comprehension of the subject matter .as history is a succesion of facts , considering that facts are irrelevant or less important than ideas and concepts , would imply that history is not an important field .such a position could not be agreed with .by way of conclusion , i think that learning facts constitutes an essential step towards the understanding of ideas and concepts .
