i globally agree with the quotation above even if i think that some precisions should be add up to complete it and make it more realistic .first , the purpose of studying is to gain a rational mind so that you can apply it to resolve and analyse various issues .therefore , it is compulsory to be able to quickly understand concepts and ideas so that you can discuss them and give an opinion without necessary having any related knowledge .in addition , facts are often the aftermath or the physical consequences of ideas or concepts .in other words , facts convey ideas and concepts , that is why they are inevitably of a superior value .for example , the castro revolution in cuba is a fact while the marxism ideology is the logic behind it .second , a reason that can explained why facts are sometimes seen as important or even more important than ideas is that facts are extremely efficient to convey an idea .people are generally more receptive twhe they can link an idea to relevant fact and great speakers often uses facts and examples to support their saying .therefore , one could wrongly think that the message is more interesting when conveyed through facts whereas it is the combination of ideas and facts that makes it so appealing .to conclude , there is no doubt about the superiority of ideas and concepts over facts .however for a student to be successful in life , he or she needs to be able to link ideas to facts and point out the existing interactions between them .i therefore think that the sentence should have been written like this :  it is important for students to understand ideas an concepts first and then look for example of the aftermath of these ideas throughout the history  .
