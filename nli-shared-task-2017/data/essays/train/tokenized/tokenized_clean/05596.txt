firstly , i thing that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be , culturally speaking , really interesting but that it can also lead to a confused professional guide line in the future .therefore , the first objective that each student should have will be , to my point of view , to find out what they will be in ten years in order to have a clear objective during all their studies .even tough , it is , obviously , really hard to now at 18 years old what you will be in the future , i profundly believe that the question should be raised carefully in order to create the student motivation .moreover , i do believe that at one stage or another we have to find out what we really want to do and then , in order to achieve , this objective to specialize ourselves .to take a simple example , at the end of my bachelor degree in foreign language i did realize that this section was not diversify enough , so i decided to change for another direction : international commerce .my point , is that it is important to focus on a specific guide line but without being too specific .nevertheless , being stuck in a specific subject can be prove to be a handicaped for the search of a job latter on .in fact , for some subjects a specification can put the student in a very difficult position , for example we all know that nowadays some departments or branches or no longer relevant or can not be provided any more .students that are specialized in these subjects will therefore have problems to find a job at the en d of their studies and they will probably have to pass another university diploma to get a more general degree in order to find a job .
