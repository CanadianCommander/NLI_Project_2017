in my opinion , a man should have a specialized knoledge on one specific subject .the reasons , both including social aspects and individual aspects , are illustrated below .for the social aspects , today , more and more companies require a person to be armed with a spefical knowledge .only by doing this can help companies stay competiable because those people is the ones contribute a lot to companies by using their strong knowledge .for example , if a person who wants to go to intel to design cpu chips , then he needs a strong knowledge of electronic engineering and helps intel stay advaced all the time .there is no reason for a company to hire a person who does nt have any specific knowledge , because every people has his specific job in the firm .even more generally speaking , companies , as well as our society , need those who have a specific knowledges to make changes in this world and let our world become better .on the other hand , from an individual point of view .the more he devotes himeself onto a certain subject , the more knowledge he will get .for instance , he who feels like studying law might have the change to understand his career direction earilier than others .this helps him to stand out of crowds and becomes sucessful in future as soon as possible .bill gates is just a vivid example , who loves computer science so much that even decided to quit school when he was only a college student .later , he built up his career as well as this world s honor : microsoft .by the same priciple , a person who concentrates on a specific subject could gain a deeper understanding on it thus broaden his view on this field , by easily meeting with a variaty of friends .meeting people , attending lecture , or conference becomes a good oppertunity for him to even become better in this field .based on those above points , i think it s better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success as well as change our world .
