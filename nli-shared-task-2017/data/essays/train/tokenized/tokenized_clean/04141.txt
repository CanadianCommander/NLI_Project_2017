i disagree with the statement , i prefer to travel alone without a tour guide .because traveling in such condition spoil the numerous opportunities in traveling .the first reason i am against for the idea is the tour can easily become reactive .travellers can lost their opportunity in learning about the destination .the travelers who are also a customer of a tour guide do nt need to learn about the destination .the service supplier , the tour guide has made a tour completely .all the travellers have to do is following the tour guide .it can spoil the oppotunity to enjoy the travel deeply .for instance , when i was in high school , i was in a grade trip committee and organized the trip .i am sure that people in the committee worked harder to know about the destination so that we , the menber in the committee enjoyed the trip the most .we could understood many things in the place , for example , the reason why the custom is like that , why people think in that way , etc .the second reason is that it can cause travellers not communicating with people in destination .it ca nt be said that you understood the place not knowing the people in the destination .due to the security reason , tour guides are scarcely introduce many kinds of places .to add to , the travellers  chances to communicate with people in destination were taken away by paying money to the tour guide .they threw away the opportunity to reserve hotels , resarch the transportation , what temperature or weather there , etc .it is much work .
