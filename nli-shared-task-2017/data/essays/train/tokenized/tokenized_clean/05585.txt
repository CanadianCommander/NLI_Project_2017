most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first of all as we know in the market companies are trying to sell more and more to get money .the television and marketing on stores influenced on people about benefits of products and try to convincet you to buy them .for example products for women : creams and lotions antiaging , products to loose weight , products to make you hair nice , smooth or curly , etc .when i go to the store and i m looking for the best option for my skin and health i always read the ingredients , if those ingredients are vitamins , how to use it and contraindications on the box and i compare with others products .after a couple of months using the new cream i noticed that there is no positive change or improve , and talking to others people that the use the same product , i found out that advertisements and marketing either pictures or comercials saying buy others consumers that they try it before convincent people to use it .i agree that people can find a lot of products on the stores saying all the benefits or even lie with the only proposit to get them for more and more people .if i can mention more examples i ll never finish because there is thousand of products seem better than they really are .in my opinion is how is made the advertisement and how much impact in people .if you dont try it and have the experience you ll never know about the p
