nowadays the advertisements are very important for a product in commerce .advertisements make the product be known and they have to help the product to be sell .so factories and societies that product something try to present their product the best they can .so that an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is often happens .for example , i love going to the cinema and obviously to do that i have to know what is on in the day i want to go ; i must have an idea of which film i m going to watch .there are many advertisements on tv , for example , that describe these films , and these advertisements are called trailers .in this case the most of the time the films whose trailers i watched seem wonderful and i often decide to go and see them ; but when i am in the cinema i understand that the trailer , during its sixty seconds , presents to me a collage of the best scenes of the film , but the other dozens of scenes are bad !in this way and in this case an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is .and this can happen also with foods or drinks .so i essentially agree with the statement , but also i think that after some time , after the product was known by the population , people start to speak each other about it and each other they clarify all the aspects , positive and negative , of the product .after that there is an evolution in watching or listening advertisements ; after that people recognized the tipical ways societies use to make a product seem better than it really is .in this way , now i am partially able , for example , to understand watching their trailer if films are bad of course or if i can try and see them .in conclusion , i agree that most adverisements make products seem better than they really are , but i think that sometimes people are able to understand that .
