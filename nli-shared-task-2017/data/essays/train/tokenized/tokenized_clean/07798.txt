students are important to learn or understand the ideas and concepts because by understanding the ideas of the subject and consept of the subject , it will make student learn easily than for them to learn facts .stuends must sure about the subject by the concept and understand ideas while the leacturer teach that subject .by understanding the ideas of that subject it is so easy to study and it is easy to remember the subject as long as possible .so i agree that the students must understand ideas and concept of the subject instead of them to learn facts .students must understand the concept of the leactures subject while teaching .for example , in exams it is easy remen  mber the concept of the subject and it can easy for writing the exam .we can implement our own ideas while we understand ideas and concept the subject .we can do research on the subject by implementing new ideas with our own concept .by understanding ideas and concept of the subject we can seminars at different places and we can clarify the doubts of the subject .the reason for choosing that the students must keep consentrated in the classrooms while the leacture explain .the students must intracts with leacture by giving new ideas of solving the problems by this the class will be so involed in the topic of that subject .students can clarify there doubts with the leacturer .students must familiar with the subject by understanding ideas and concept of the subject .where the learn facts are simillarly good to gain knowledge by there learn facts .it will take more time for them to learn factbecause they have now the concept and understand the ideas by there own will take time .it is so tough that to learn facts with them .so i preferd that the students must understand ideas and concept of the subjectby the leacture instead of them to learn facts .learning concept and understand ideas are more important to students .
