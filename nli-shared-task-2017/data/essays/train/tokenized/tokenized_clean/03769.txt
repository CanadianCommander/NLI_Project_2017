i completely agree .that is the purpose of an advertisement , to try to make things look better than they really are .our society is based in capitalism and consumism .the more you make people buy things ( even the ones they do not need or work as they should ) , more money is made and companies are able to grow and expand .if a company selling a specific product wants to be profitable and expand , it needs to let everyone know that its product is the best .now , if you are trying to sell a product but you just realized it has some flaws , would you tell the custommer about that ?most people would nt .it would imply to invest more money trying to make the product better and capitalism is about making money not expending it .after all , if a company can make money selling quality products they will do it .in advertisements , marketing people look at the good points of a product and focus on them , making them look like the best option for the consummer .obviously , they wo nt say anything about its disadvantages or problems they will try to make people want to buy that product .however , that s why some countries have aggencies to keep track of custommer complainings made about bad products .if they find there s a problem with the product they might contact the company responsible for that and make it fix it or do something else in order to compensate the custommer expenses .i think the important point here is the ethics of the company trying to sell products .if the company only cares about making more money , they will try to sell low quality products , however if they have good ethics , they ll try to sell always the best products even if they need to expend more money
