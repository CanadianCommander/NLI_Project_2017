concerning the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well , i agree to a cerain extend .while certain people can achieve a certain level of success by only drawing on old knowledge the majority of the people who have success , do so because of their willingness to break out try new strageties .the first part of my essay will give arguments for this fact , while also providing examples .the second part will draw the attention on the fact that experiences and old strategies can still be usefull , while only partly .if one looks back in time the most people that can retrospectively regarded as successfull have taken risks and tried now stregeties .the willingness to break out of fixed patterns of society and try new approaches has mostly resulted in success .this applies for various fields , such as natural sciences , humanitarian scineces and especially the business world .to give an historical example , gutenberg invented printing as a means to reproduce texts in the 15th century .with this he risked the anger the clerus , who had a monopoly in this field .however , he was successful and changed the way of publishing forever .also today we can find similar examples , which can also be much simpler .for example the starbucks inventor had the simple idea to sell standadized coffee to go at various places with a brand name that stood for quality , as opposed to the classical behauvious of drinking a cup of coffee in a cafe .however trying out new things is not sufficent to be successful .it is important to have draw on a certain knowledge and certain skills that exstist already .without those skills the development of a new idea can easily result in faluire .for example the building up of the starbucks empire , which was founded on a new idea , would never have been possible without the knowledge of olod established economic principles and business knowledge .to conlude i want to draw aon the importance of the two elements that are important when trying out new things .it is important to use long established skills and knowledge in order to develop a new a idea and realize it as a porject .this approach is only logical because old knowledge and skills have once been new ideas that people fought for .it therefore behoves us to use those old methods to realize new and daring projects .
