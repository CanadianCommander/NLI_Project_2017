nowadays , most of the young people have a job , a family or live only in a relationship with a girl/boy .so they have nt much spare time , but in the following text , i will mention my opinion and how it could work .on the one hand , if you live at home with your parents and go only to school , you should support your parents in the household , because you live there and get everything from then , so the parents can ecxept some help .you should nt do anything but you can share the work , which has to be done .for example you can make a plan for a week or longer about who have to do the dishes or to clean , so everybody make some work in the house .the work should be fairly shared .on the other hand , if you go to work to work all day from morning until the evening , it is very difficult to find a fair solution for everybody .after the work you are tired and if you should do then some work in the household is very hard .for this problem , the solution could be , you can arrange with your parents to do some work at the weekend .ok , you are young and would like to make party in the evenings , but i guess you live at home and your parents care for you , so you should give something back to them and they will see that you know what they do for you .they get something back for there cares or worries about you .i ca nt understand the young people , whose think that their parents have to do all the work in the household .when the parents cook for me , it is absolutly okay and my job to make the dishes .moreover it is my job to clean my clothes and to iron them .finally , i think there are not many young people who do like me .most of them , it is sad but true , think , their parents have to do all the work at home , so they can go out and meet friends .i absolutly agree with the statement that a lot of young people don , t give enough time to their communities .
