success in life is determined by the work you do and the amount of time you put toward that work .everyone has a dream of becoming successful one day and achieving all their goals in life .sucessful people do nt just become sucessful overnight , they work hard and have strategies which they follow very closely .according to me , it is important for successful people to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .people who have the courage and the will to become successful will take risks .life never works the same way all the time .what one has learned might not be useful in the real world setting .they might have to change themselves or modify their ideas to make themselves eligible for the real work setting .for example , as successful chef that person must have taken all kinds of risks .if the chef is a vegetarian chef , he/she would have taken the risk to work with non-vegetarian food .if the chef had only been working on vegetarian dishes and never tried cooking non-vegetarian dishes he/she might not be a competitve chef .taking risks and trying out new things makes people look and stand out as better and more knowing candidates .trying new things might not always result in a success but it is worth an experience .it is this experience that teaches people great lessons in life .for example , the most famous thomas edison was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments which were failing .he was asked , what is the guarantee that this time your experiment will succeed .mr. edison replied that he has 228 reasons why they will not succeed .this reply shows that successful people take risks and fail but still take risks because they know exactly what they are doing and are confident enought to justify everything .if successful people like mr. edison never took risks we would nt have bene able to see these innovative inventions around us .success is marked by one s efforts and hard work .in order for those efforts and hard work to work a person must be willing to take risks to become a better and a competitve candidate in his/her field of expertise .also , to gain an experience and achieve more in life .
