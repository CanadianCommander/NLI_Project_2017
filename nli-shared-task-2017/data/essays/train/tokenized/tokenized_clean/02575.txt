are there differences in enjoyment in life comaparing young people and those of whom are older at age ?well , i think that is a question that depends on a personality or different backgrounds in which the person came from .however , i do think that a more younger person will have the advantage in enjoying and having fun in life because they have less to worry about .when a person becomes older they are more aware and warned of personal and social problems , at school , friendship , grades and so on .what i thought was the most difficult , while growing up to be a pre-teenager was that i had to conform with others and i had to use the right choice of words .when you are little you have limited thoughts of how your words may affect others and how you accept differences , but when you grow up , you may be discriminated and segrigated because of your skin color and the clothes you wear , or the way you look .these problems cause you to worry more and be less out going .it can also cause you to be depressed and make you choose the wrong choices in life .at school , not just young adolecents but also college and university students have stress up on managing their time to complete and hand in their assignments in on time .with the growing stress , you can find yourself caught up on homework and writing essays , which prevents you from having free time to spend for your liking and enjoyment .when you become older you have to worry about mannaging your deadlines at work , how you are going to pay the bills , conforming with your co-workers and more social problems along with personal stress .with all of these stress and `` things-to-do  going on , i do nt think that you will be able to enjoy your life so much as well as a younger person with less stress and less work would .
