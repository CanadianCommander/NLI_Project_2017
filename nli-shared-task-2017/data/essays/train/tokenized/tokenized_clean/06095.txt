i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know .todays world of comfort and happiness we are enjoying is , because of the efforts of many successful people .i can mention the following points to support of my argument .firstly , each and evry person has their own success , in their own terms .people who have urge to get a good life keepaside the things what they achieved , and try to do things what they have nt achieved .if we take the school going children , success for them is to complete primary schooling , and after that undergraduation , and then graduation and then getting a job , then they will start thinking about the familly and their children .though they remember about their past at the back of mind , they will concentrate more on the future and be a sucessful person at that instance of lifesecondly , success may vary from person to person .for me success is more like a getting a good job .for my parents success is having abetter education for their children , eventhough it is difficult for them to invest for the studies and taking the risk .if my parents just stop investing on my education thinking that they can not risk it , we will not have a better future .each and everyperson try to be successful by trying newthings and taking risks .finally , each and every country have their own successful leaders and buisiness people and people of variety of fields who took the risks and invented new things .we must be thankful for them for what we are today .they are responsible for happiness and comfort of life that we are enjoying today , and we must put our effort and be a suceesful person rather than sticking and doing the same things .in conclusion each and every person can be successful , if they work hard and give more better life for the future generations
