no risk , no fun !i believe that the statment `` successful people try new things and tak risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do  is a very wise adice .it seems that people with a new business tend to play on the safe side , instead of taking risks .it is often argued that if one makes changes in a slower manner , one s business will be safe and success will be guaranteed .it may be a slow process , but it is safe .unfortunately , people that have such thinking also tend to forget that playing on the safe side , will not guarantee success .there is not one method or formula that leads to succes .such thing does not exist .with every decision we make , we take a risk .if one truly `` plays on the safe side  , there are no changes made .every single time that we make a choice , me make a risk .so , if even playing on the safe side , turns not out to be so safe after all , why sould one not go for the whole ?taking risks and playing with new ideas and sturctures , can be very helpful to a successful business .the odds of failing by taking a risk , can high or low , it depends completly on a particular situation .you should not forget that the outcome of someone who is taking a chance , and is succeeding , will be much more valuble , than from someone who took the `` easy  and `` safe  way of making very small changes over time .if you would graph the failures and success of two different businesses , one who makes small changes , or even none , over a long period of time , and then of another business who is making constant changes and is playing with their possibilities and the freedom they have available , you will see that business one will have a postivie rising curve , and that business two will have a line that in - and decreases from time to time .but eventually if you would compare these graphs , business two will be the one with the most success .if you want to have a successful business , you have to go beyond your knowledge and experience and be willing to discover new , and perhpas , even better methods and structures .
