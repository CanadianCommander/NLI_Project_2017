i feel that in general , today s youth do not show much concern for the community .however there are a few exceptions , and by gaining inspiration from such people we can change the current situation .let me illustrate this with an example .in my institute there is a social services group called nso .all students are supposed to work for a minimum of hundred hours for this organization over a period of two years .the nso carries out activaties like educating poor children , tree plantations , cleanliness campaigns , etc .however , as a secretary of this organisation , it is extremely disheartening to see the apathy of the students towards such activities .whenever we plan something , only a few volunteers come up .ultimately they run short of completing their hunred hours and ask me to help them in an inappropriate manner .what are the reasons for such lack of concern .one could be , lack of time .there is a lot of competiton amongst students .as they strive to achieve the results they aim for they forget what they owe to society .often students are motivated to do community services just to make a statement on their resume .however , i would be wrong if i said that this applies to all youngsters .i have a friend who is just the opposite .he is very passionate about community service and does it because he feels for it .recently the college cultural festival was organized .it is time for enjoyment and fun for most students .i was amazed to see my friend running a stall during the festival to raise money for an ngo while the rest of us were having fun attending rock concerts .to conclude , i feel that although most students feel the need and the urge for working for our communities , it is only a few who turn that inspiration in to action .
