i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first people who try new things can have more chance to make a success .i have seen the tv program showed how one of korean business man got succeed and able to finally export electronical devices to us .he used to be a engineer in a small electronical company .his salary was good and economically stable .however , in spite of negative opinoins from friends and families , he decided to leave company and make a new one because he had lots of idea and experiences for the electronical devices .initial period , he failed many times due to lack of experience in marketing and so on .however he tried many other things like change the design of the product and collaborate people who knows marketing and business .now he is a ceo in the big company that earns $ milions per year .people who is willing to take risks can have more chance to succeed .my mom was poorly educated .she always has passion and will in her mind for further education like going high school and college .though she has two kinds and families that she has to take care , she decided and started to search what she has to do for further education .she took many lessons from the private institutes and took exams to obtain the graduate certificate for the middle school and high school .now she is trying to go for the college to study what she wanted to study like english literature .she gave much more chances and opportunities to herself by trying new things like learning things from different places .
