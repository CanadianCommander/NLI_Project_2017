i agree with the statement that successful people try new things rather than repeating conventional methods .generally , a success is considered as a victory of any kind of competitions that achieve certain goals that people would regard highly .thus , in order to win a competition or achieve a goal by any way , people need to have more strength of any kind .thus , i think exploring a new area or new things would give people a better method to achieve a goal that would be highly competitive against other people , while the exploration might have risks to fail .bill gates , a founder of microsoft , is usually considered as one of the most successful people .his achievment started from a new idea : to produce a personal computer .it was obviously challenging and risky for him to do the business , since a computer back then costed enormous money while taking huge spaces .it was not really possible to be owned by a normal individual .however , he succeeded it , and now , he is one of the most successful business men in the world .another example of a success based on risks would be gabriel garcia marquez s new style of writing literature .his magical realism attempted to overcome the limit of a novel by utilizing a totally different way of writing .his extremely descriptive and flowing writing style was first not very well-regarded ; however , he is not considered as one of the best writers in latin america , and numerous writers actually imitate his writing style that a new style of writing called `` magical realism  finally was created .even in science , it is necessary to attempt to be creative and try new things than others to be successful .for example , german army in the second world war had confronted a problem that their missiles could not reach america .their effort to improve the range of missiles was great , but it kept failing due to lack of accuracy as the range was increasing .however , a scientist thought of a new idea to solve the problem .he thought that it was not necessary to launch missiles from europe ; if it was too far , they can launch the missile from closer place .thus , the scientist invented a missile launcher that can be installed on a submarine , which apparently could attack the main land of america with extreme accuracy .in general , a new method that creativity provides grants people to be more competitive .as if an armed person fights with an unarmed person , it is certainly beneficial for people to try new things .even though it usually has a high possibility of failure , it is worth to try to explore new ideas , and generally successful people are people who have obtained a solution by new things without failing .it can be said that although there is a risk for a new thing , if it does not fail , it will be a base of a success .therefore , it is worth trying new things .
