i disagree with the following statement because i think that nowadays the car is most important for life and the people do nt make a step back .moreover i think the design of a car is improve of the 100 % and the innovation in this sector is in a great improve .so the innovation is most imporant in the world and the case-s car improve your gain to make a new car , and for this reason i think that for the nex twenty years there will a lot of cars in the world .i think that twenty years are few to change the situation , if only there will some problem who can will danger for umanity life this statement will be real .for sure i think that a uman life of nowadays are depending of a car in fact if one people must go at work and if must few km for example one km , take a car and , for this reason the car in the world improve .if we look around w can wacth all days many car in the city or in a village and as the statistic test demonstrated the number of a cars grown in the world .certanelly i think that the problem of the environmental is many too , but do nt all the people understand this problem .to solve this problem the people must use too bus or train to move but this is impossible now .in another word i think that a number of a cars improve because the people do nt undertanding a problem who can cause at the environmental , and i think that the progress will be continue .in fact there is many other reason because being improve a production of a cars , one of this is a globalization who make a world generalized when the markets tends to produce a lot of product so in this case are the cars .to sum up i think that in only twnty years the cars will not decreasing , and only the big problem of the environmental will can change this situation .
