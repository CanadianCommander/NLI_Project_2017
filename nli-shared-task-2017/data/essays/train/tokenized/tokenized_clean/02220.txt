the question if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts has been discussed already quite often .in my opinion it is of greater importance for students to understand ideas and concepts .the main reason for studying , espacially if seen from a humanistic perspective , is to learn how to think freely , put questions and understand the concept of a subject .although facts might be crucial in professional life , every single job will probably require the knowledge of special different facts .for example a businesswoman will work in a consulting company while the her former study collegue will work in a bank .it is just impossible to include all facts which are needed in a curriculum of a career .therefore it is unavoidable that every newcomer has to get into the demands of a job individually and often start learning from scratch .as i have seen e.g. in my history classes you will very likely forget some facts but you will never forget the broad idea , for example the reasons for a war or for the rise of the nazis .this is much more important to know than to remember every date or the exact sequence of some engish kings .this leads me to my next point .when you study the idea of a subject you also learn the ability of how to do research and where to find facts .therefore i think it is not fundamental to know every fact but rather to know where you can find the fact .several people go as far as stating that it is actually not important at all what kind of content you learn at university , but that you learn how to do research , how to write papers , how to solve academic problems and how to work without being told every single step like in school .but this is definitly only true for the humanities and not for professions like doctors or physicians .to summarize , i prefer studying concepts and ideas because i think it will help me to develop more important and sustainable skills than just facts .
