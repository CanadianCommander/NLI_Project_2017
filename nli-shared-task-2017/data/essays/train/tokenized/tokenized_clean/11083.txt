i think it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .first of all if you want to understand ideas and concepts you have to do a lot of research .for example galileo galilei had do a lot of research before he understood that the earth is not flat and is instead a ball .it took him about twenty years .for normal students to understand some physic problems , we have to do also a lot of research in our book or on the internet .if you start doing research it gives you the opportunity do think about the idea and learn something about it .another reason why i think it s more important to understand ideas then fact is , that fact sometimes sem really clear .we know for a fact that adolf hitler killed himself .if you would study the facts you woul study only his dead .instead if you are studyieng ideas and concepts , you will learn why he killed himself and why he all did this .for me a fact is something short wich we do nt have to study , but an idea or a concept is something big you need to do some research on .finally , if you are learning to understand the idea and concept you can use your studies in live .if you studied the idea how a car is working you can work at a carshop and repair cars , but if you only learnend the fact that cars have a motor you will be not able to build a car .when you study to understand ideas and concepts you learn way more about life , then if you just study facts .facts do nt give the background were you can ask `` why  .a fact is a fact and nothing changes about that , but you can discuss about an idea or concept .
