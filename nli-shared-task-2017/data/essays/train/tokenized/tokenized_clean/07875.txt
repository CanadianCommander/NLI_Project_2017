i agree with the following statementbecause all of these are risk while living .for example iam a food engineer .i know food very well .but i mus nt work in food factory or deperment of food in factory .may be i am successful an other depertmant .in my family my uncle is a doctor .he is nt work in hospital .now heis working international factory and heis very successful person .so i take risks to be successful person .first of all you love your job or work .when you love , nothing is problems .finally look at life of succesful persons , they take alot of risks everytime .
