learn s methods are really important , they allow education system to be more efficient .there are several patterns which can be followed by teachers .for instance , they can choose between focus upon ideas and concept s or on facts .to understand ideas and concepts improves students ability to develop their logical skills .these qualities are required by a lot of areas as mathematics , biology or economic .for example , in economics , you need to understand all market s mechanisms to be able to explain how works an economy in any country .ideas and concepts merely learn you how some events are engendered .to learn facts is more important for culture .it leads students to know the backgroung of some situations .they can in this way easily picture in which conditions some concepts take place .by following the same economic example , we can say that the knowledge of some history contexts allowes us to understand why at some moments economic theories have not worked .for instance , it can be implied by an event that one of the theory s assumptiom is no longer respected .at hence , for all these reason i utterly disagree with this statement because understand ideas and concept is complementary to learn facts .
