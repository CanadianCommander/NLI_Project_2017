it is sad to say so , but i am afraid it would be completely the opposite .not only there will not be fewer cars in twenty years but there will be more cars that our roads , fuel resources and specially , environment will be able to take over .it seems that in these days everybody has a car , new , second-hand , blue or red , compact or station-wagon , whatever the shape or model , when a young man or woman reaches the appropiate age to drive , they get one car .and this is specially true in the case of usa , where a person has nothing to do without a car .everybody gets a car as soon as possible , not only because it is cheap .also because long-distance communications throughout usa may be really good , but that is not the case when it comes to short distances .moreover , when you are driving , if you take a look around other cars next to you , what you see is that most cars are only filled with one person .maybe most of the people are heading towards the same direction , but nobody agrees to share the car , which will result into less fuel expense and from that into less air pollution .my opinion is also based on the fact that public transportation is already well developed , except in cities where there is a possibility of building an undergrown net .i do not see any future perspective of an alternative vehicle but who knows what will happen in twenty years .those futuristic films where we could see spaceships floating on the air seem to be very faraway .it is true that every day there are more low-cost airlines that provide very cheap flights .but cars will never be replaced for short-distance travels .there will be more and more cars and this will have a terrible impact on our environment which already damaged by the pollution that cars produce .the best thing would consist on finding a new type of fuel , based on natural components instead of petrol , a new efficient and friendly-environmen
