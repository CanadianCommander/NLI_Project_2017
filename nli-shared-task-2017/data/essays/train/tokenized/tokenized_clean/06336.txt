with the development of society , there are increasing choices to enjoy life as people can play computer games , chat on line , or go to see a live performance etc .although these all seem to be what only young people can do as they accept new inventions and opinions more quickly and have more energy to enjoy , it is a little bit haste to assert that young people enjoy life more than older people do .does young people really have more time and energy to enjoy life ?as the pace of modern society fastens , young people who have already had a job face the pressure from their bosses , family members and other people , worrying about not getting promoted without recommendation , being troubled by a tiny mistake during the work and therefore making great efforts to work in the hope of completing their tasks perfectly .as a result , they always keep in a hurry to get things done and seldom have energy to enjoy their life .what s more , for the young people who are still college students , the fierce competion when hunting a job also drives them to study hard and develop many kinds of skills .for example , in the college i am studying in , most of students are striving to get certificates in business english and computer skills and taking a lot of courses such as communication skills , which may be helpful in future career .in contrast , as older people do nt have to face all the challenges , risks and difficult choices , they tend to have a more peaceful mind and enjoy life more than young people .some people also argue that the modern technology such as computer skills used in many methods to relax makes it hard for older people to enjoy .in fact , many old people have been accustomed to taking adavantage of these innovations .for example , my grandfather who is 60 years old have been good at chatting on line and downloading movies and music from internet just like a young person .and also , old people can enjoy life in different ways without technology .they can take a walk and take exercises in a park , or listen to music sitting in a chair , and for some of them , looking at grandchildren being around is a kind of relaxation .
