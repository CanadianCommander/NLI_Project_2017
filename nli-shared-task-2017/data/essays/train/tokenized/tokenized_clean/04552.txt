technology is ever-changing .a genius is born every now and then , who brings about new inventions into the limelight .if these inventions are beneficial to mankind then they soon replace the old ones .one such example is the mode of transport before automobiles were discovered .people either travelled by foot or they used the help of animals like horses , donkeys etc . .then came the invention of the wheel after which carts were made .these carts were driven by bulls and these bullock carts became the means of travelling .further , engines were invented , which led to the production of automobiles i.e. both two wheelers and four wheelers .currently many cars have been manufactured and are available in the market .every year , a new model is designed , having a better engine efficiency , greater mileage , a different size or simply a different seating arrangement .these new versions soon become popular in the market .just as how we have transformed from a bullock cart to a car for our mode of transport , in the same way twenty years hence there is a possibility for the invention of something else that is novel .but the question is - `` what next ? !.could it be a car which flies or could it be a locomotive which looks like a spaceship ? .the design of this new locomotive is left to the imagination and skill of the inventor .since , this new invention would then become famous in the market , the demand for cars would eventually reduce .as a result of this , fewer cars would be used twenty years hence .
