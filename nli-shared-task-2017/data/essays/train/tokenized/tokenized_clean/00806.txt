i first tend to agree with this statement and i actually hope there will be less cars in the world , because pollution is a serious problem .according to me , in twenty years , they may be a problem about oil .we use so much of this right now that it might not be available in the next decades .if the oil becomes harder to find , then it becomes also more and more expensive .the richest people may then be the only ones who will earn enough money to buy what is the main need to make a car work .i can even imagine people using their own bike instead .why not ?would it not be better for our earth ?moreover , new laws preventing the use of cars may be created .governements may take actions to prevent married couples to own more than two cars for example , or other things like that .anything can be done , i think too many vehicles are on the roads .since we are talking about close future , maybe we will wait much longer for changes to be seen , because , let us also be realistic , more and more people own a car nowadays , it is indeed so comfortable to own our own way to move from place to place in such a short period of time .we need ten minutes to go somewhere by car , and maybe fourty by feet .so it is hard to agree or disagree with the statement because all of this depends on how the world will turn out to become in the next few years .it depends on people s state of mind , on politics , and on the decisions that are going to be taken .but anyway , my point of view is fewer cars would be a good and possible thing which would be likely to happen if each one of us are willing to make efforts to help our planet .
