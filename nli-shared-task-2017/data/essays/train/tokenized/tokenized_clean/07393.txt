today people , especially young people , enjoy more then older people .i think it is a very true statement !for example in my family i often go out at the saturday night , i usually go to the movies , to pubs or to the restaurant !instead my parents never go to the restaurant or to the movies !i think it happens for several possible reasons .one possible reason is that the life today is earier than before .today we often have a lot of money .my mother usually tell me that when she was young she has only two or three dress .i think it is incredible !i have a huge amount of dress !a second possible reason is that in a city now there is an incredible amount of cinemas , pubs , restaurants .there are several opportunities to enjoying .furthermore each family has a car .a car allow to move people easier than before .thus actual young people can enjoy themself more than previous young people .in fact the actual economy is better .there are more money , so there are several possibilities to enjoing .
