some people say `` no risk , no fun  and because of this no profits and furthermore no success .i definitely agree with these people and with the given statement .of course there are witnessed examples of successful people who just copied ideas in order to earn big profits .of course many people who do not run a business in which risk and creativity are daily questions , are able to realize a nice career as well as high wages .and of course people who define success in a completely different way such as being a member of a kind of club maybe even the captain of a bowling team are successful with a high degree of riskaversion .but from my point of view people are only successful if they are able to change their environment significantly .i do not reffer to the direct environment as the personal social context of an individual .i am talking about changing the whole society or at least the business sector you are concerned with .what would our world look like without great reformers and visons of few people ?personalities like m. l. king , adam smith or mahatma gandhi changed their society with their inventions , theories or opinions .but without taking risks or thinking in new dimensions , developments that occured as a result of their thinking would not have been possible until now .to be successful it demands a low level of riskaversion , a genious strategy ( that can be a simple strategy as well ) and the ability to implement it .and facts you already know might be the basic knowledge to explore several ideas but without risk and the willingness to do something completely new success can not be realized .finally i totally agree with the given statement .i would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeating that from my point of view risk and success are strong partners that can not be changed .
