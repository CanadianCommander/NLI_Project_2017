the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  is a quite provocative statement .in order to analyse this i will differentiate between some types of advertisements .as far as i think there are three especially effective ways of drawing attention to a product or service .the probably most effective one are tv commercials .in second place i see magazine or poster advertisements .thirdly i think radio ads are quite effective .exactly in the order that i listed these three types i think there is a hierarchy present that is linked to the statement .tv commercials are extremely powerfull !the human mind is affected by such commercials in a great variety of ways .the visual stimulation is obvious .it is also understandable that the audio affects a person .but an immense power of a commercial lies in those factors that are delivered to the submissive mind .let s say you have 24 to 30 images per second in a modern film .if one image per second shows your product in an otherwise `` normal  film , you get automaticly attracted to it .fortunately that way of advertisement is prohibited because the customer might be affected against his will .poster and radio advertisements only have an `` honest  attempt to draw the attention .but still they can as well include a lot of stylistic devices that can influence a viewer towards the product .colors , for example , are extremely powerfull .although different colors might have different meanings in different cultures .in the western hemisphere for example red might represent the wild , blue the relaxed and silver the elegant .that way a customer might get the feeling of an extremely stylish toothbrush if it is shown in a bright silver light .that way a special significance is attached to a basicly normal object .this as well might vary between cultures .therefore i agree to the statement .personally i think this is the great power the advertisements have .commercials play with all the associations people might have and by doing so they deliver a message that somehow praises their product or service .
