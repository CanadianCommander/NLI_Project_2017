i have worked for a long time as a researcher in my university s laboratory .what i have learnt during that and other experiences is that only people taking risk and trying new things are successfull .threfore there are at least a couple of reasons according to which i agree with the statement .the first one is that people trying to explore new things most of the time give a different point of view to all the other .for example , when einstein has introduced his theory of relativity he has become one of the most appreciated scientists of the world .his theory has opened new research fields and it has been the result of a deep research conducted making new assumptions , trying new things and taking the risk of being criticized .the second reason is that who tries new things is in general a very particular person and in many occasions i feel like them .during my experience in the laboratory , for instance , i was used to get in a deep state of concentration , eliminating all the external stimulus i could have .few months after i have finished my experience in the laboratory , i have read some biographies of famous and successfull people and i have understood that they all have this attitude to isolate themselves from the outside .concluding i can say that i agree with the statement because i think that people trying new things give ever a new point of view to mankind and because sometimes i feel like one of them .i hope that in the future i will do something by which i will remembered as a successfull person .
