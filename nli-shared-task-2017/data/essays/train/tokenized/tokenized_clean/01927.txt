in my point of view as a social worker , i disagree that it is better that people should learn and study as much and broad knowledge as they can .instead , i think people should specialize in one specific field .here are my reasons .to begin with , each person has a special talent and habbit which he / she is perfect than others .it is important for us to let every people excert their abilitis who only he / she has .take my sister as an example , my sister like play guitar very much .but in my famiy my parents always think and put a strong emphsis on that children should spend all their time to study and it is secondary for children to learn others such playing music .from that time , my sister always live a hard time because she did not like studying all day long and she also again and again get a bad grade .by constant communicating with my parents , they finally knew that mabe it is a better choice letting my sisterplaying guitar instead keeping studingin addition to person s the special talent and habbit , efficiency is also an important thing to our society and it is important for us to let our society more efficient .finally , the concept about that people should kow much and broad knowledge can avoid wasting the social resources .and then we can use the rest resources such as money to do other things .based above those reasons , although the opinion of that it is better that people should learn and study as much and broad knowledge as they can maybe be reasonable and understandable , i agree that people should specialize in one specific field .
