yes i agree with the statement because they will have the dare to implement their innovative skills after one success .they always try to do0 something better and useful than the others .they will never go with the things which have done before but they will change or add some more features for those which have done by them earlier .the succesful people will also take the ideas of the others which will be useful for them .they always goes with the concept `` try and try until you succeed  .this is the major concept used by many of the successful person because they wont leave the thing what they want to do .for example i would like to consider mr. darren buffet , one the of the richest person in the world .at first he was a cool drink seller after that he invested some money in stock market he went into loss side .even though he was in the loss side he didnot changed the track in which he was really interested .now he became second richest person in the world .he had only view in his mind is he want to succeed in his field he made it possible without diverting .there are many people whom we can take into consideration .even many of them were not from rich families they became a worlds important persons .we have to think in many ways for one thing then only we can succeed .every one is having some of the ideas in different feilds they have to implement their ideas in their interested field they will definetly succeed in their future .the people who are very innovative in thoughts will succeed and also become inspiration to the others also .i would like to conclude that be confidential in what ever we do then only we can succeed and be as inspiration to the next generation .
