i support the idea that most advertisements give wrong information to make products look better by three ways .firstly , companies use many pictures which is not about the products .customers notice the advertisements by the picture which is not about the products .it means that customers give first impression by something which is not the products , and then they misunderstand that this first impression is about the products .thus , advertisements give wrong information for customers .secondly , companies use many techniques to stand the products out .for example , a silver watch stands out in black backglound , and it makes the product very cool .however , when the watch is used , most of background color is skin color .in this color background , a silver watch stands out less than in the black background .this kind of techniques is often used for advertisements .thirdly , companies use words which makes the products very good .they often use the words , such as new , cheep , and good , but these words do not describe the important characteristics of products .for instance , a cheeper computer always has less performance , such as amount of herd disk .however , companies try to hide this fact by using the word cheep because the word cheep attracts customers .in other words , they try to give wrong information for customers .to conclude , most advertisements tend how to sell more instead of how to inform the good aspects of the products .the main purpose of companies is making more money , so the customers have to understand that most information from advertisements include lies and be clever .
