i disagree with this statement because without learning the facts it can get you nowhere .ofcourse , some people think that without facts it wo nt take too long to find out , but what if they did nt know if they were right .to put it this way , say that you want to learn something in biology in plants , animals , fish , reptiles , insects and mammels .to know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book , you can read through the main facts and details that was given to you .if you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book .if you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem .also , another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened , example who killed someone or who is the one responsible for commiting a crime .to find out , you need to ask yourselves : `` how did he or she died and who killed them ?the questions will be answered if you gave in every information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people .either if this person is guilty or not guilty .life is not easy on how it sounds when it is important for students understanding ideas and concepts but a faculty is the way that shows what can be featured and how can you explain it .given through what the topic is about , to me , i think it s a good way to have facts better than to ignore them .it helps me learn alot when they were given to me and preparing to answer that i choose this because it is best to find out more than hesitating to answer it .
