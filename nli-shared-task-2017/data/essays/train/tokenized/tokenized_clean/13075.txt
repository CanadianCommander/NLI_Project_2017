i support the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i hold this believe because cars have already caused too many damage to the environment and use a lot of natural resources , hence they will be eventually superseded by other highly environmental friendly transportation tools .let s look at first what cars have brought with us over the decades : pollutions , trafic accidents , waste of irons and used up of oils etc .those negative effects have already impact our life a lot .such as people will loose their best friends or relatives during a trafic accidents .more importantly , the negative espect also impact our enrionments .we all know that the worlds becoming warmer and warmer , while one primary factor contribute to the global warming is the excessive immission of gasses used by millions of cars everyday etc .this harmed our world s air and damaged the environment .consider all these negative impacts , there are voices that already recommend to ban the production of cars .further more , twenty years later , as producing more cars will turn out to be not realistic because of the tightier resource constraints , people will stop producing cars and turn to produce other transportation tools .given the rapid technology improvement , i stronly believe that cars will be finally superseded with another more advanced transportation tools .this can be true after sentific researches and many experiments .imgine a life that we can go anywhere via jet planes that similar like the situation just as dipicted in the fiction film .then , our life will be totally different as what we are today .in conclusion , twenty years from now on , i belive that there will be fewer and fewer cars in use than there are as of today as a combined efforts of sentists and the publics .lets cross our figure to wish the environment of the world , the dearest place that we live together , can be better and better after our mutual efforts for example to find other transportation tools that are more environmental friendly than cars !
