i fully agree with the statement .for me , the main purpuse of an advertisement is to show a product to someone ( a person , a group of people , a company , etc ) in order to sell it to the person .so what other way to sell a product than show it the best way possible .and if the product is not so good or not that good looking , the only way to convince the audience that this product is worth buying is by showing it a tiny bit better than it really is in fact .a great example that i have in mind to illustrate this , is the following one : when you are waiting in a fast food , restaurent and you are looking at the pictures of the food you are about to order , you always see all the french fries lined-up and  facing  you .you always see the food displayed in those posters in a way that you have never seen it on your table .the reason food is more attractive on the posters is that the servers , would not have time to re-arrange every french fry in order before you eat it .and of course , there is no way that a fast food brand displays it s fries just like it is in real life , because nobody would order it .some might say that if the product is really good , there is no need to make it seem better than it actually is .and again , this is usually wrong .let s take for example a big brand .whatever products they manufacturing , they will probably be another company out there that is selling the same product ( usually a little bit different ) .in order for the first company to sell its product more that the competitor , the company needs to invest on a advertisement .and the main goal of the advert is to show that the product is better than any other one that looks the same or have the same functionalities .so basicly the advert has to show that the product is better than the other , so probably also better than it in fact really is .and finally , is a product is really good , there is probably nood need to make an advert in the first place as it will be a self selling product .
