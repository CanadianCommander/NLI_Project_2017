it is often said that knowledge limits you .i could never truly figure out what that meant until i saw it in application to life .and i agree with the statement that - young people enjoy life more than older people do .as one grows up , he undergoes many stages in life .each stage is a learning experience in itself .each stage has its joys and sorrows .a baby would be considered at it s first stage in the game of life .his troubles would be limited to being fed at the appropriate time and probably aquiring a new toy .that s why you see young kids smiling at all times , even in their sleep .as we grow up we realise that life is not all peach and roses as it was painted for us to see , but in fact each action has its set of troubles and maybe sometimes rewards .we are induced with new worries and tensions with each passing day .securing a job , supporting your family , aquiring a suitable pension plan , and eventually settling down in life is all that one sums up his entire life as nowadays .this constant struggle to achieve his aims , prevent man from stopping for a moment and enjoying the celebration called life .young people are more blessed .they have limited amount of stress as they are not completely aware of the problems that await them in their higher stages .they enjoy each moment as it comes .to put it in better words they live life .consider an example of a father who slogs day and night to earn enough to put his son through college .he doesnt mind putting in those extra hours at work as that would secure his son s admission into a good university later on .the son , on the other hand , would be blind to the hard work and efforts that his father puts in for him , and enjoy each evening out with friends .maybe a responsible son would match his father s efforts and maintain top grades .but lets take a practical view on this ; that hapens one in a hundred !it s not that young people shirk off responsibilty but just that they are more smart in shifting them to another day .older people are more serious in their approach to life .this is a continuous cycle and might never end as young people grow up and one day replace the elders .so live each moment as if it is your last .
