i will support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .it is very short time that people are called as young .so i think most of young people enjoy their life because the time is really limited .my opinion is composed by the following reasons .first , young people have enough time to study or learn at school .most of them are going to the school in order to obtain the skills or knowledge .sometimes studing is hard for students , but they can enjoy the class or lesson with their friends .futuermore , most of schools have some interesting events for the students during the year .for example , my school have the event called `` internatioal day  in which students in the international school will sell their traditional food or perform the traditional dance to other students .it is very interesting for me and i really enjoy it as i take a part of it .second young people have many opportunity to find out what they want to be in the future .it is difficult to think it but young people have enough time to consider what they want to do in the future .they can go to the university or expertise colledge in order to study more about the fields that they are very interested in .sometimes it is possible that they can experience the social work in the society .for example many young people are willing to have a part time job .some people can find out what they want to do in the future through their job .finally young people can hang out with their friends during their free time .it is important to make a good friendship with others .most of older people do not have enough time to spend their time with their friends because they are busy .in contrast yound people can meet and talk to the friends whenever they want and can spend their time together .the friendship will be good as well .sometimes they can travel to the foreign countries and make a great memories there .to conclude , young people have enough time to do something good for them .they have much time to study a lot , to spend with their friends and to think about their future .for these reasons i agree with the idea that young people wnjoy life more than older people .
