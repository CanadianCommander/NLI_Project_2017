first of all the years of young is great years and they will be a great memories when the young get old .the young years is like a fresh flower but will be dead when the young get old .every body does nt want to be old , every body want to be young .actually the young people has diffrent properties than old people .the young people they are more healthy than old people .the young people also they can run long distance than old people .but the young people they ca nt feel about their young years untill when they get old .which is that wrong .the young poeple they should secure their young and trying to keep it with them untill when they get old .some examples for how to secure their young years by playing sports , eating fruits , vegetabils , and doing excersice every single day , etc .secondly iam not agree or diagree yet until i finish from my explaining about the young and old peoples .actually some of old people they are tired and they have physical problems .these problems what they have from their young years because when they were young they did nt use it correctly .by different reasons could be smoking , not that much exercise , or do nt eat goods , etc .so the young people they should take care for them selfs and try to get away from the bad things that can harm their young .thirdly the young people life could turn to the old people by the reasons i mentioned in the second phargraph and also the old people life could be like the young people life .so the young life is not everything unless they take care of it .also if the old people take care of them selves they will live better than the young people life .in conclusion i agree about the young people enjoy there life more than the old people unless they take care of it .finally i would say if we take care of our selves we will enjoy our lives with out any trouble or facts that can stop us from enjoying our life .
