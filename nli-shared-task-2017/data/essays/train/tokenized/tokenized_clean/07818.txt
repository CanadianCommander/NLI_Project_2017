it is rightly said that `` knowledge leads to success  but it is also said that `` half knowledge is dangerous  .according to me one should have knowledge of all subjects when you are undergraduate level but when you go for masters degree or doctrate degree one have to specilize in a perticular subject .having broder knowledge is always useful .one should have a broader perspective of all subjects at school level and college level .this provides them with a carrier option who are really confuse what to choose as there future and what they are good at .knowledge is helpful in every walk of life .people here are really confused about distributng and how to utilize their knowledge .one should understand that knowledge is never wasted .if one is gaining masters degree for instance he can not do masters in all subjects .in that case he has to choose a specific subject .but imagine if there is a group of old school friends meeting after several years and if all are from different field .imagine a person sitting quite and can not speak because he has no knowledge of what they are arguing on .what a miserable situation that is .hence according to me every type of knowledge is useful in life but one has to make a choice in later part of his life have to go for a single subject .
