now a days young people are affected by many aspects of the society , so that they ca nt able to help their communites .i agree with the statement by the following reasons that , because of their education system , extra curricular activities and affect of media etc .firstly , i could discuss about education system .in my country our education system makes all students so busy all the day .they are busy with their tight schedules of classes and study hours .they do nt even have a minute to spend time with their parents .as a graduate student i am also facing the same problem .so that they do nt have time to help the communities .secondly , young people are used to spend their time by extra caricular activities , for example playing sports , participating in seminars , giving paper presentations and attending conferences that are realted to their education .all these factors makes them so busy .i also used to attend the seminars and conferences when i get a free time .finally , media has its great impact on youth .for example television , internet , magazines and tv channels .all these factors are attracting the youth .so that they are wasting their time by spending their lot of valuable time to watch tv , using internet etc .one of my friends , who was also my classmate , addicted to internet browsing and chatting .he spent most of his time by chatting with his friends .therefore he spoiled his carrier by neglecting his studies .this incident shows how the youth are inclined to unnecessary things and not showing their interest in helping communities .all these factors indicates that youth are spending their time for their personal activities .however , some of them used to participate in some social welfare activities , such as helping poor people and orphans .i conclude , that most of the youth use their time for their own purposes rather than helping their communities .so that i agree with the statement that , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .
