i do agree very much that the advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .i would say that the company that wants to sell a certain article , have to present it as something you must have .some times they tell you that will make you nicier , some time they tell you that it will make you smarter , but they allways try to convince the customers that if you have `` that  product you will be better .companies invest a huge amount of money in the advertisemet field .they know those maney are well spent .this is increasingly happening since the world of the telecomunication has been globalize .an example often mentioned is the coca cola .in every corner of the world you go you will be able to see the advertisement of coca cola .and it works !there are many places in less developed countries where is easier to find a bottle of coca cola rather than wather , and some times it is also true that is safer to drink coca cola insthead of water .actually i believe that the companies , sometimes does not present them product better than they are , but they make the advertisement in a way you think that `` simple  thing is now nice and usefull .of course behind this process there are plenty of professionist that just work on it all the time .to make you feel , you can not leave without that `` mobile  phone .i am old enough to know that the life is possible ( and may be better ) without that mobile , even if it seems to me , when i think about it , that it has allways exist .pruduct can be as good as they are advertised , the trick is , how to make peaople think that thay ca nt leave without it , and i am sure they will find a way to sell you anithing they want .there is also a copmetition between them , i mean between the sellers , so that they have to show his products compare to a `` common  one , and tell you the reasons why his product is much better compare to another , wich is usually less costly .but this is another issue .
