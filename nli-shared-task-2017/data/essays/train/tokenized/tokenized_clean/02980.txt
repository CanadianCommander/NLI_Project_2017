i agree with the statement that successful people take risks rather than doing only what they know .successful people do take risks as they want to escape from the ordinary life .i do not call myself a very successful person , but i once have taken a risk and my life had been better .first , some milionaires famous in one area , once was a expert in other things , and i think that happens because that those people know how to master on one kind of subject .henry ford , the father of car , once was a expert on a watch repair .he worked as one to earn his room rent and to study mechanics .then he thought about transportations and invented cars .next , the successness is equal to the riskyness .which means that when you have a high probability of failure , then you have a high reward when you success .i am in middle school grade three , since grade two , i liked a girl .she is in same school and i still like her .i wanted to say that i like her , but i got to shy when i stand in front of her .when i said that , i felt like falling down a endless cliff that i could never come up again , but when she laughed , said nothing and looked at me , i felt like a mattress holding me from the cliff , so i like her , and she knows that i like her .lastly , risks are sometimes making something new or re-designing some products .edison , the king of invention , once tried to hatch an egg , and did not to go to school when in elementary school .his mother taught him .when he were grown up , he made a telephone which was already made by alexander graham bell .however , the edison s phone was better to hear , so people bought edison s phone .in conclusion , successful people try new things and take risks rater than just doing what they know and what they can do well .
