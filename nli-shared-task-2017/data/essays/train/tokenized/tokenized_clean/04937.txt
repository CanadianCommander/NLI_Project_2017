i disagree that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i really think that the ways of energy for cars and other characteristics will be different but still there will be cars .following some explanations :nowawdays , the petrolum is becoming more and more expensive .the ways to obtain petrolum are more costly and sophisticated to reach certain areas in the deep of the oceans or earth .in additon , petrolum can be found in oceans that are lead by extremist countries , which is a cause of conflicts or even war in extreme situations .the gas for the cars is becoming unaffordable to many people that uses the car as a mean of tranport .the research of alternative ways of energy to substitute the gast is a real need .this research has been already started in many countries and by many companies , therefore cars that use solar energy or other types of energy already exist .today , the cost of these innovative cars is higher than current cars .on the other hand , i belive that the sooner the gas is not any more available or only available to very small part of the population , the demand of these new innovative cars will be increased and prices will be down making the innovative cars affordable .people that has a car today is used to have one .they use it for real needs like going to work , shopping , transportat or moving from one city to another if there is no other mean of transport .some people is so dependent to the car that they use a car for ocasions where it could be more effective to walk , take the train or the bus .in 20 years time the need will still be there and the car way of energy could be different .i think that the appearance of the cars would be also different according to the new times : shape , size , materials , safety complements inside the car .
