i agree with this statement because at the begining of every inovation stay ideas and concepts .without them you can learn nothing about facts .this statement can be best described on the example of the begin of a carrear .if you are new in the company and you are chalenging with new tasks and maybe problems which you have to solve .what would help you ?you have to start with analysing the problem .this implies that you have understood the concept .after this you can try to develop ideas which could lead you to solution .and only at the end you will use the facts to come up to the solution .another aspect wich confirms this statement is the fact that that the facts are always available .you can get the facts from books , from internet and from another different sources but there are no sources for ideas .if it would be so than there would be a lot of reach people .so the main aim of every study should be the ability of developing ideas .this is also the main feature which makes difference between university and scool .the fact are the contents and only helpfeaters which you use to realise your ideas .
