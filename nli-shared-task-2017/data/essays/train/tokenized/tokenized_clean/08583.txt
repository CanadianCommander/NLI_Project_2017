i think that helping one s community means taking part in the community actively .therefore , if given the choice , i think that yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are two reasons .first , young people nowadays are very busy .for example , i would like to think about junior high school students in japan .they go to junior high school , of course .after school , almost all of them go to cram school .they have to prepare for the entrance examination of high school .they ca nt come back to their home until 10 p.m or so .they do nt have opportunities to meet their neighbors day time and know what kind of people are in their community .they do nt have sense enough to feel living in the community .second , young people tend to enjoy their free time in thei home even if they have much time .these days , there are many enjoyable goods which you are alone .one example of this is the internet .with using the internet , you can communicate with not only your close friends but also people in the all over the world you have never seen .the internet makes you decrease the opportunities to meet someone face to face .taking part in the activities held by community and touching your neighbors make your community more powerful and cheering .but young people do nt go their community because of being busy and atractive goods in their home .as a result , i think young people do nt help their community .
