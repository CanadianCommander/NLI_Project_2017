it is true that learning many kinds of knowledge of academic subjects is good .however , it is also true that learning a specific subject is better to be specialized .i strongly agree with that teaching specific subjects to students is more efficient .there are several reasons .first of all , most students learn a lots of subjects in the school and have exams in each semister .however , it is not necessary to become a specialist in one part .for example , i had learned many subjects from academic such as history , neuclear , and pantam physics .but i am a president of online-game company now , those things that i learned are not necessary directly for me .second , people can learn from their peer and famliy about something like history , music or art .most sports man who are played in major league baseball in the united and premier league soccer in the u.k. in my country have learned their specific area for their life without studying broad field .sometimes , it is not good to communicate with others variously but it is nice to get a job and to be a prefessional .as society is getting more complex , the meanig of knowledge is more complecated .therefore , it was to know about everythings , but , now , it is to study a vital knowledge in specific area .therefore , i agree with that it is better to specialize in one specific subject to get a job and to be an expert in the special field .
