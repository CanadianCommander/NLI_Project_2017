no , definitly i do nt agree with this statement .i think in the future it could happen exactly the opposite in the usage of cars , and i m going to explain why i m sure of this .in my opinion , the main reason among a lot of aspects , is the relavant explosion , in these years and also in the next future , of the asiatic populations , and , as a direct consequence , of the asiatic market in this sector .in these eastern countries , as , for example , china and india , there is a big population that is in costant increasing of their birth , but , what is more important , is growing the level of their social and technological culture and knowledge .it means that those populations , that together have a number of inhabitants which is about thirteen times larger than the one of united states , will create in all economic areas , and so also in car sector , a big market that in the next twenty years could only increase the number of material goods ( as cars , in this case ) which will be exchanged in the global commerce .in this particular example , furthermore , there is another very rilevant aspect which can be affirmed to support my thesis : it is about the relations , in those eastern countries , between the population and the territory where thei live .although the number of the inhabitants is so high , the extension of the territory that they occupe is very big , and the need of movement from one side to another of the city it is a real aspect we have to considerate .nowadays this problem is not solved with an important solution , but it is reasonable to think that in the next years , with the increasing of the technological culture and possibilities , will be built more roads and than cars will become the only mean of indipendent trasport and movement .
