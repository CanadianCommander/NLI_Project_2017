no one can cast a shadow of doubt on the fact that there is innumorous number of advertisement in the world .there is a discussion among different people about whether advertisements make items seem much better than they really are , or not .as regards the aformentioned idea , i reckon advertisements do not show what they really are because they forcus only their merit , and use attractive pictures in them .besides medicen and cigarret commarcials , companies emphasize only advantage of their products .for example wash soap , in the tvs or magazines , they show only very clean white plates and clear glasses .audiences understand how it is effective , we can clean up everything so easily .however , of course we have to spend some time to do dishes , or maybe we need soak them for little while .they do not show the various type of food stains .therefore we do not understand actuall effect of the product .furthermore , advertisement makers use very attractive pictures in them .beautiful landscape , pretty acctress , among others make it nicer .for instence , in a cosmetic products advertisment , there are always a beautiful young actress .even if the product forcus for antiaging , they pic up young model .of course her skin integlity is not because of the product .however , people do not know her actuall age , thus easily people believe the result .in a nutshell , advertisments are created for incresing their salls , therefore , companies want to show only good points of it
