in my opinion , young people have the chance to enjoy life more than older people do .first of all , i am convinced that young people have more opportunities than older people do .indeed , they have all the possibilities in front of them .as they have no real responsabilities , young people can do what they want without thinking about their children or their job .moreover , we can denied that young people have a good health .so , they can travel a lot , discovering new country , doing lots of sport .hence some old people can travel but they have to face to their physical limits .the social life of most of students is particularly developed and active .i have the feeling that young people meet friends everywhere and everytime .the lectures offer the opportunity to see friends everyday .even if their family matters , they have the opportunity to live their roots to enjoy new experiences .they have no fundamental obligations .i am myself o good example of a free joung woman .in fact , i have recently decided to live my parents in order to do an internship in a big company in paris .i have two roomates with which i share lots of things and we have the project to go to australia next summer to find a job as a waitress and improve our english .finally , i think that young people have less doubts and are less disappointed by the life .in fact , i believe that some experiences could affect you and change your frame of mind .i have often remark this phenomenon for the old people .sometimes the lost of their friends or a member of their family could make them sad .given all of these points , i am really convinced that beeing young is a chance and offers a large range of opportunities .
