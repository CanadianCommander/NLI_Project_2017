i am of the view that the number of cars which will be employed in tewnty years from now will be lesser than the amount present on our roads today .global fuel price inflation has reached an all time high .the prices of transport fuels have become exorbidant .buying a car will no longer be a provident option .this inflation will only compound in the next twenty years and hence the idea of buying a car to the common man will no longer be an attractive option .the environment is decaying by the minute .people have begun to realize this threatening trend and are inclined towards a more environment friendly existance .cars , with the pollution they emanate do not help the environment at all .with growing awareness , people will recognize ths danger and abstain from buying cars which are sources of great air pollution .the world s poplutaion has increased rapidly and will continue to increse over the next twenty years .unfortunately , the size of the earth will remain the same .thus , traffic congestion will be a major problem and a hurdle in years to come .the only prudent method to tackle this problem will be to introduce effective public transport systems .people will prefer to take the bus or the subway rather than having to wait for painfully long periods of time on the road while commuting .this will therefore lead to a dwindling in the number of cars being purchased .the cost of raw materials needed to contruct a car has also risen alarmingly and will continue to do so in the next few decades .for example , metal prices have soared and metal forms an integral part of the cars body .this will lead to a hike in the car prices . .manufacturers will have to increase their prices to accomodate the high cost of raw materials .the high prices of cars will discourage common people from buying a car .this is also one of the reasons why people will refrain from buying a costly commodity .in view of all the above reasons and illustrations , i feel that they will be fewer cars being driven in twenty years from now .
