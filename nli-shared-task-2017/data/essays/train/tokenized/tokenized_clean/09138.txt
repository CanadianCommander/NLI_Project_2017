there are widespread opinions on the responsibilities and expectations of young people nowadays .i think that young people today still spend sufficient time helping their communities .but before beginning the reasoning , `` young people  and `` helping their communities  needs to be defined : i consider young people to be teenagers of the age between 13 and 19 years old .help in communities comprises activities , such as supporting the elderly , being engaged in municipal politics , playing in a sports club , or spending time with small children during holidays .many young people today are engaged in politics to help their communities .the number of members joining political youth organizations has steadily increased over the last ten years .when talking to those teenagers , i can see their motivation and enthusiasm to participate in political work .they are aware that they have a responsibility towards their community and even enjoy this fact .secondly , the popularity of sports clubs has never decreased .most young people are at least in one club , such as the local soccer , tennis , or track and field team .although some sports have seen a decrease in members , other sports have become more attractive .this can be exemplified by sports like american football , baseball and beach volleyball .finally , young people today are aware that social activities are meaningful and even useful for their future life .everybody who wants to apply for a job after school knows that these activities are an important part of their resume .somebody who has not participated in any social community work is less likely to be an attractive applicant .some might object that nowadays young people spend more and more time playing computer or surfing the internet .however , this objection can be countered by the fact that young people used to watch tv a lot or maybe read books instead .the argument misses to state how young people in former times helped their communities .to summarize , the political engagement , the popularity of sports clubs , and the awareness demonstrate that young people nowadays do spend enough time on helping their communities .
