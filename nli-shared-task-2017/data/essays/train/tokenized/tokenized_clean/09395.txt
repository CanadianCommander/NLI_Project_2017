i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are two reasons : busyness and lifestyle .the first reason why young people do nt use much time to their communities is thier busyness .recently young people have less time than before .because the world changes very rapidly , they have to learn a lot of things to catch up the changes .imfomation technology brought us internet which let us contact easily to the world network .then , we have to check floods of information nowadays , while it was enough for us to check some specific information in old days .in adittion , recently young people have more complex job than before .they have to learn many things to do their job in order to get enough money to live .the second reason is the change of young peoples life .many young people prefer to live in big city where do nt exist much communities .so they do nt have any insentive to use time helping their communities .it s not rare case that they do nt know even the person who live in nextdoor .in conclusion , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
