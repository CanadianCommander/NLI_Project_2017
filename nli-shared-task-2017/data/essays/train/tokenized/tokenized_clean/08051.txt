knowledge in a broader sense is always helpful , but keeping knowledge in many acedamic subjects rather than in one specific subject will be difficult and in practical scenario will keep you on `` no mans land  .i personally disagree with the statement to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specilize in one .there are strong reasons for this , let us take a subject for this , say `` industrial design  this seems to be a one subject but its a complete discipline in itself any academic curriculam if design will include all those subjects which will help in this subject .specializing in one subject will make a person skillful and specialist of its subject or field .he can contribute to the industry or a society with his skills .this is one aspect of the specialization , it has another side also , it will bring people from different fields and subjects together and will encourage a teamwork , example of a autobobile industry will help to make the point clear .to make a product one broadly needs a designer , a person who designs or visualise that product , an engineer who will make that product work , a marketing person who will sell it to its right users , thus they have to work together and everybody has to be a specialist in his subject as a engineer can not sell or a marketing person can not design a product .though it looks very simple but it is very difficult to execute as each and every person in any industry has a specific role , though they can contribute in other areas with their ideas , but one has to play his key role in that particular process and thats why skill or expertise counts a lot in todays competitive field .specilization will not give you a choice from the career point of view , but it will make you known for that particular subject .most of the people who served the society with their knowledge were highly specialized in their respective field .thus , it better to have a specialization rather that broad knowledge of many subjects .
