i agree with the statement that there might be less number of cars in the future than they are in the present .firstly , i think global warming will play a major role in revising the transport modalities of the people .climate changes being reported by various environmental authorities are forcing people to think about the future .already lot of fuel effiecient cars are coming into the market and also cars which are using alternative fuels other than petrol which have less harmful emissions .if research goes on in the same direction cars may be replaced with some other alternatives .secondly , growing population in the urban and rural areas and the number of people driving vehicles has become unregulated in many countries like india .narrow roads , traffic blocks especially during the rush hours is forcing people to use mass transport .people are looking for alternative means of transport as they can not afford to be late to work .in twenty years time things might become worse and cars might not have anymore place on roads .thirdly , the growing costs of fuel day by day is making people think each time they drive a car .in the future resouses might not be sufficient enough to meet the demands of growing vehicles .in the past , people used bicycles , horses , etc as means of transport .now science and technology have led to the invention of cars , buses , aeroplanes etc according to the needs and supply of the present generation .where there is a need or demand for a particular commodity in the market , there will always be a supply .as the demand comes down , manufactures might stop supplying cars but may shift to newer inventions .people in the present are definitely relying more on cars and newer models and also the number of cars are increasing day by day .fuel efficient and environment friendly vehicles like hybrid cars might still have a place on the roads .but in the future things might change .attitudes of people might change according to circumstances and changing times .growing stress levels , unsafety , accidents etc might be factors which might force cars out of roads .mass transport might play a pivotal role in the coming generations .
