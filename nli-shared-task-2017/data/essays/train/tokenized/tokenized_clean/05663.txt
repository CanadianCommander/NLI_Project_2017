since the invention of the automobile , the amount of cars has increased .now we can hardly find a family wihtout a car and even can see ones with more than two cars .as the population grows , at least it is not decreasing , the amount of car will increase too .so there wo nt be fewer cars than today are .car is very important in our life .it is the most individual vehicle that we can ride .there are public transportations but we can only use the limited usage of vehicle of the public transportation .that is , whenever it caome to an accidental situaltion public transportation wo nt be very helpful to individuals because individual can not use them for their own purpose .so the car is necessary in our lives .however there are a lot of problems caused by a huge amount of the cars .two major problems of them are air pollution and limited fuel .fuel used in cars are basically refined petroleum .so when it burns in the engine ti emit co2 and make no and no2 which are the main pollutant of air pollution .also petroleum is limited resource that would gone in next few decades .car has its importance in our lives so it wo nt decrease in amount but instead there wiil be new forms of car .for example , a hybrid car use hydrogen which burns and emit water and an electric car which use battery and motor to run will replace the current form of cars gradually .
