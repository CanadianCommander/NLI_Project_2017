in the context of constant competition between products and trademarks , what makes them different ?is it the product , the advertising or the trademark ?we ll see that `` false  advertising is necessary for a company and is controlled by the rules od competition .at last , we ll see that advertising is nt the product underneath but much more a identifying suggestion for custumers .first , a company that launch a product can not possibly find a large scale of custumers without promoting it .therefore , a company needs advertisments to exist or to continue existing .with the laws of competitions , the advertising is in a way self-controlled .as we saw last week with `` loreal  , a company can not say anything in an advertisment .they have to be able to proove their assertions in an advertising campaign otherwise other companies will sue it for a lack of accuracy that dammage the market competition .second , the companies usually `` lies  about their product because they wo nt tell you immediatly the side effects or problems you might encoutered with the use of the product .advertising will sell you the good effects of the products .but , i do not think the real matter is the product underneath .i mean more and more advertising do not sell you a product directly but an underground , an atmosphere or a celebrity .in a way , advertisments are here to held you identify a trademark , the one you want to look like or lifestyle you want .and , a advertising campaign is more like a dream maker , suggesting that you need the product if you want to achieve a certain lifestyle or look like a celebrity but it did nt tell you that you will achieve it .advertising just show you the way because : `` you worth it  and `` just do it  .to finish , advertising might lie on a product because they only show the good side of the product but they ca nt be exagerated and the real challenge of a advertisement is nt to sell you a product but to keep you for life .
