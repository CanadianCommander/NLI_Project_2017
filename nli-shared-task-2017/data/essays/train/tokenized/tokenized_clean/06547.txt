i believe and i have observed that successful people always try new things and more importantly do not hesitate to take risk .this is the way how people see and meet new opputunities waiting somewhere to pick it up .eventhough trying new things and being open to changes are fearfull to most people , i think this is the one seperating those who govern and others who are governed .i also strongly believe that taking risk is the key to success espicially in busuness .for example , my big brother resigned from his job in turkey and went to united states for his graduate study .some people who never want to try new things and always doing the same stuff forever blame dmy brother as foolish because he was trying something new and taking risk .however , in the long term , my brother completed his study in the us and now has become a director in an oil company currently running in russia and making a lot of money .those who blamed my brother still do the same job with fixed salary and closed vision .now the world in which we are living has become a small village and is changing in every hour in terms of rules and ways which we live  which we do business , and so on .even if we do not want to try new things , i believe , the current conditions are forcing us to change , try new things and taking risk .i have several friends doing business in different part of the country .i clearly certain that those who did new things addressing taste and preferences of custoners , for instance , have been winners at the end of the day .nevertheless , some of my friends who do not like taking risk lost their business .i have an specific but trategic example with one of my friends doing slver business in ankara .i strongly urged him that he had to try new markets especially foreign markets for his products he was producing .in addition , he gad to take some risk for losing money .he chose his old way and avodid new things .unfortunuately .his business is noe dead .in summury , i am in favor of trying new things and taking risk .so that we will be able to improve our personel attidutes and busnisses .this is the way how we can prepare ourselves for future .
