`` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know hoe to do well  .this statment is often said about people and what they should do in order to be successful .succes is measured by what you have accomplished .in life if you take risks your are going to be more successful because your are going to get better at what you do , improve in some areas and learn .first , if you take risks you are going to get better at what you do because you are going to have more practice .having more practice you can see what you are better at and what things you should improve .one day my friend was really scared about making a decision because what if she failed .the first times she tried she was right , she failed .but with practice the teacher is born .she became so good at what she did that she was more successful .second , you are going to improve your qualities .like my friend , she realized what areas she could change and improve them in order to be better .if you dont take a risk you are always going to be good , and thats all .you want to be great at everything and sometimes we just need a little push and courage to know that at first maybe its not going to be better , but at the end of the road you are improving in every single way .third , by taking risks and chances you are learning .learning is the most important quality .if you learn from your mistakes and from the things you are good at , you can combine the knowledge and create something wonderful .people are successful because of what they do , the things they create and what they are good for .every person during their lifetime has to take a chance , risk what they have .if they dont they are never going to be great , just good at what they are .but if they do decide to take a risk they are going to learn so much more that even if they fail they gain more knowledge than a person who didnt take a risk .this is why successful people take risks , to gain to knowledge of different things , and to be great at what they do .
