advertisements are utilities of companies to sell more pieces of their products .and alone this hypothesis makes me wanting to say : `` advertisements make produkts seem better than they really are !an example for such advertisement is about cars .often you can see cars in tv which roll over a lonly street in a beautiful countryside with a hawk on sky .this makes you feel free and good but there is nothing said about the car itself - for example if it is chep or how much petrol does it need for 100 kilometers .also you can often see cars driving trough moody streets and hard theretory but in normal life i do not have the possibility to drive in that and i would not have it .another in last time often discussed product is the cigarrette .in most advertisement persons who smoke cigarrettes are cool ( like at `` malborocountry  ) and have much friends and social contacts .this makes you believe if you smook you will have friends .but there is nothing said about the bad things like tumores and losing power at sports , or only about the fact that many nonsmokers do not like to kiss a smoker .also other kinds of advertisement are realy problems for some groups of persons .if you have a children , for example , and in tv are all of these nice toys and electric cars shown but you have not the mony to buy something of that it is very hard to explain this circumstance to a kid .so the advertisement can effect some familyproblems .and i think it is not nescessary to say that this toys are not that good in the eyes of your children i played with it for some time .but it is not only the advertisement which makes things semms better than they are .the pacage of produkts is another important detail .an example for this is milk .i think everyone like to bye his milk in a bottle , because you can see it an it looks better than in a so called `` tetrapack  .so it ist not easy to say it is the advertisement alone .
