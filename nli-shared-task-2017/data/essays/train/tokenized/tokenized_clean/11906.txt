i do not agree with the proposed statement and i will give different examples showing that young people nowadays are not as selfish as presented .first of all , i must confess that there is a common image of young people depicting them as more and more selfish , only worrying about themselves , playing on their computer and waiting for the diner to be ready .this picture is usually compared to the one presenting young people some decades ago , helping their parents at the shop , in the field or simply at home .however , my opinion is that this selfish image is too limited .more and more young people spend time and efforts in social organisations .for instance , the number of boy scouts in belgium is increasing .scouting is typically a place where people learn to care for their communities .they organise activities to help homelesses , they help at the church and take part in social events .another example is the social work which is more and more proposed by schools to students .students are proposed to work for social organisations during a definite period of time .these social works are more and more popular , showing that young people are ready to give time to their communities , as soon as they receive the opportunity to do it .furthermore , there are plenty of young people that each year leave their country during summer holidays to go and help other communities in need .some are going to build schools in africa , others entertain small children in asia , ...this shows that young people nowadays care not only about their community but are also ready to spend time and money ( they usually pay their fight ticket ) to go and meet other communities that need their help .to conclude , i think that this image of the lazy selfish youg people which is very strong in belgium as well as in other countries should be corrected , lookimg at all the other young people who work hard to help their communities and even others .
