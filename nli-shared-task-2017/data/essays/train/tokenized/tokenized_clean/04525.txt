i will agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .success depends on the proper planning , the amount of effortness , taking the right decision at right time .there are many successful people that they become successful by taking risks .for example thomas alva edison who invented the electric bulb by doing almost one lakh experiments by trying the new ways and by taking risks finally he succeed .there so many scientists are there who sacrified their life the world by inventing the new things by taking risks .in politics there so many succesful persons are there .for example abraham lincon the americas formar persident who came form poor family became the president of america .in the early stages he was also unsuccesful but by perseverence by taking risks he became succesful .another example is mahatma gandhi who sacrificed his life for freedom fight .his weapon is non-violence .he took several years for getting the freedom .by taking risks and try the new things to fight agaist the rules of british government .finally he was succeed .according to bussiness the most successful person whom loved is dheeru bhai ambani the former chairman and managing director for reliance industries ltd .he came for a middle class family and he started his carrier with small petrol bunk with a little money .after that by taking new things and taking risks he became the most successful person .because of the hardwork and the perseverence taking the right decision in right time he became more succesful .however by taking too much of may cause so many problems .some people think that doing what they already know to do well .by that way the successful people try new things and take risks and get success .
