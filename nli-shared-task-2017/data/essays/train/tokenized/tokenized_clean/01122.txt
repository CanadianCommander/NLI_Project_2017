i believe that understanding the ideas and concepts is more significant than learning facts for students .there are two reasons which make me think like that .first , when the student try to understand the main idea of a particular subject , it is easier for the student to examine what is really meant .by this way , the student gains the opportunity to think and critisize the concept of the subject .when the student has the ability to critisize , the student may draw new conclusions for that subject , i mean the student may have a different point of view , and discuss its advantages and drawbacks with his classmates and professors .this really helps to improve the thinking skills of the student and very useful for further researches such as attending a graduate program after the school , if he intends to .second , as we know the human brain is open for new ideas , memorizing what is told in the class would not be helpful to the student for his upcoming classes .because when you just memorize the facts without knowing its causes for a specific time period , for instance memorizing classnotes before the exam , it is inevitable to forget all of it after a meanwhile .to conclude , i think learning the reasons for a certain subject is for the student s own good to understand a specific subject clearly .
