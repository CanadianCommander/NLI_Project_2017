many things in the world are so complex , if we want to get all facts that it might be take a long time to understand all .in my opinion , the efficient way to learn things is to get the main ideas and concepts , instead of understanding all the facts .the better way to know a fact is to attemp getting it by ourselves .if someone always tells you anything what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledge .you just follow others steps , without thinking deeply .you will not find other news dicovery , because you always think others  opinions are correct .it will stop prodessing , and it makes our brains get rusty .for instanse , when i was studying in university , the professer always theach us the way to study , not following the books and reading that .the meaning of teachers is to help students find their ways to research , they can tell us about different fields talking about .if we are interested in some specific area , we should research more information about that by ourselves .afterward , analyze the information and discuss with professers .it s the way to learn knowledge , by means of the mothod and we can find more necessary information than we expect .in my opinion , the better way to study is to understand main ideas and concepts .if we just follow ours  opinions , we can just stay in the same place , without process .we should think something by ourselves , and it is possible for us to learn more things which we should know .
