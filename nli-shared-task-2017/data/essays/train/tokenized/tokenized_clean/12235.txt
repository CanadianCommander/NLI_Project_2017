i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .an education based on the ` why  behind many different topics will provide a holistic education to students .as a result , students will understand ideas and concepts .students will have clearer pictures .a student will learn a few factual information while he or she is in the process of learning an idea or a concept .the student will become more creative .the student will be in position to contribute more meaningfully to different discussions with different groups of people .such learning help student build some skill sets such as soft skills related to analysis , thinking .also , students feel encouraged to opt for constructive environment in which the learning is based on ideas and concepts .students feel no undue stress on remembering facts as just remembering facts are not going to help in the long run .instead of remembering some rules or incidents as mere facts , the student will be in position to question the existing those rules and incidents .there are chances that more new ideas and concepts will be generated .for example , recent changes such as orgnanized producers in retail sectors have resulted in better and efficient processes for the end customers .in today s online world , the factual information is easily available .students do not need to do any rote learning .also , learning facts hampers a student development .students will rely on memory for such a trivial case about which information is easily available .for example , a trivial case would be that how many bones are present in human body .there is no need to learn such facts .instead , once the student is aware that the number of bones can vary during the different stages of life or can vary due to some external factors .the student will be in more position to understand the reasons for such a varied number .such a discussion based on ideas and concepts will provide more insights to everyone involved .in sum , students who understand ideas and concepts will excel in life from the all round development and will be in position to contribute meaningfully to the socielty .
