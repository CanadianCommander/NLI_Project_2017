i completely agree with the statement that sucess comes to those who take risks and walk the path less taken by .numerous stoires revealing how great discoveries and inventions took place by the people who went on to take risks .to state a couple of examples i would like to start with neil armstrong , the first astronaut , who took the risk of going into the space and walking on the moon .man had never thought that could ever reach moon but it was made possible because some body thought differently and then went on to risk his life for that thought .otherwise man kind would have never been able to reach the moon hadent he had the faith in the thought that it could be achieved .another example that can be cited supporting my thought would be that of j.l baird the inventor of television , he thought that by emitting electrons on a surface through a cathode ray tube images can be formed , it was only then that he could develop something which laid the base of the modern tv , he thought differently , and then put his thought into practice , it could have been dangerous but then the development of the modern tv would not have been possible .mahatma gandhi the father of the indian nation used the most unique method of `` ahimsa  or non violence to gain independence , nobody thought of it , using non violence against violence , was unique , he risked his life to that thought and went on to gain independence for india .thus i would like to conclude my essay by saying that you have to think out of the box to be successful , normal and conventional everybody thinks and does , but what clicks is a unique idea , what sells is a unique idea and for that you have to think and do apart from the league and the people who do that are heroes or weave success stories .
