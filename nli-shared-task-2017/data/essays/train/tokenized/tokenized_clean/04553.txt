the twenty first century is the era that lots of discoveries done for the sake of the human-being .this is done by scientific improvements in lots of areas .but how are these improvements done ?by the scientists knowing things about many subjects or by the scientists specialized to only a single area .since lots of special subjects about a single topic could be seen nowadays , it must be noted that improvements done by the specialized scientists .first of all , if we think of the history of science , the scientists of that era had ideas abut lots of issues such as mathematics , physics , chemistry and so forth .however , one sould keep in mind that there were fewer things discovered until that time for that era .as a result ; even though the previous scientists were not be specialized to one area , that does not mean that today s discoveries have not been done by specialized scientists .as mentioned before , lots of subjects could be observed about a special topic or area .for instance , if we think of electrics and electronics , one could be drowned in lots of areas which are telecommunications , electromagnetic waves , power electronics and so forth .in addition to this , if we think of the history , we can not talk about electronics before 1960 s when the semiconducting devices were first used .as a result , by the improvements in electrics and electronics with the specialization to these areas , the humanity has a easier life .for instance , would not be so hard to live without mostly used devices which are cell phones which are products of telecommunications .if we think of eyes which are the cameras to the enviroment for the human-being .if we deeply analyze what is in the eye , we must note the importance of retina , cornea , eye lens and so forth .for instance , the people suffering from diabetics may lose their visions due to problems in the retina .or simply , if we think of contact lenses which could be used as artificial lens , these are improving visions of millions of people .to summarize , all these about the eye could be done only by specialization .to conclude , since a single human being can not know or remmeber the whole idea about one issue , it is important to specialize to one area .as a result , more improvements could be done about that area and as a result about that issue .
