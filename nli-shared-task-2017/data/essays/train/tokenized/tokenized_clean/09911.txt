i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts it is for them to learn facts .it usually for the students to know how they make a good life and understanting the fact .not only for the students but also in every peson in this life .learning facts is how to make your minds open .there is many reasons for my agreement , it makes the student have more understanding for anything , and to keep the idea in his head .any student must make concepts the idea for him to understant the idea exactly .if he concepts the idea and he understand it very well , he would not forget it any more , and he will learn the facts by this way .for very simple example , if the student takes in the school that if he will not wash his hand before the meal , he would have a stomech aeche , so he will do it any more .not only for the student but also for any pearson , even children or adults peaple .in their job or in their house they should concept evrything for them self to know it correctally or exactly .anybody should konw the fact for everything to make them minds open , therefore , it make them very understanding person to talk with them .in conclusion , understanding idea and concept it for them is very good idea to know the fact exactly .knowing the fact is some thing very important to be an open minds person .
