the question that `` youg people enjoy life more than oder people do ?  isn t right at all .i mean some old people enjoy their life also .on the one hand young people are younger their body do everytihng what tehy want to do .but on the other hand young people don t do the right things that helps their to live longer .for example they smoke more than older people , because it seems cool .and usually they take drukes and often they drink more .these are all thing which shows that young people enjoy their life .but it isn t so , i mean when young people do that they want to go more to the death and they aren t enjoy their life they make it smaller .in opposite of the younger people older people enjoy their live , too .but not like the younger it do .they can not do much more things , because they have families and a job .they want to live for their family .they must work to get money to buy foods and some other needs .they must show their children that they are good parents that do everything for their families .but i mean , no i think , that oder people do the same thing like the younger people in their past .we can that both are , i mean older people and the younger people , enjoying their life .the older people do it in the past and the younger people do it now .for me is enjoying the live very important , because when someone enjoy his life , he can say in future that he miss his past .he can ask his children the past of his live and he can say his children what to do in some situations .it s like the history , but of the personility of one human .i think that i enjoy my life but not more than my father it did , because we live in modern time , nothing happens at tis time .but at the time wher my father was younger there happens so many things .the world have change at that time , for example computers were made and other things .i hope that i enjoy my life in the future .
