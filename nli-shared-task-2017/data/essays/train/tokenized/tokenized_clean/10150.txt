as people know more and more in their lifetime , they suppose it is the most important to try things new , in order to bring them to a higher level that can make them a successful person .however , this could hardly be true since success not only costs new ideas , but also hard working and patience of woking on things they have already known .first of all , it is said that practice makes perfect .without repeating over and over again , doing the same thing , people can not finish a task greatly .for instance , the famous chines athlete , liu xiang , as one of the best runner in the world nowadays , he is successful .yet he is trained to do the most simple and basic things everyday to win the golden metal .he is requested to go slowly running and log distance running , and jump back and forward in the field .these things are certainly the things he knew how to do when was five years old .although knowing how to do them , he keeps on practising everyday , and the repeating , however , takes him to the first place in the race and achieve his success by this kind of training .so , doing what a person has already known and do it better and better , even the best , can enventually make a person successful .in addition , poeple keeps doing the things they already know is much more important than merely trying new things .this is just like a basic attitude towards life , which shows that a person can not do things he knows well , can barely do things he does not even know .for example , if a person does not read very well , that means he/she can not read fast and accurate , he/she will not achieve a nice score in university that requires a high level of reading skill .in this case , the reading ability is the person has already known and , further , may has the approaches of how to read well , but the poor reading ability affacts him/her in the field of further education , and the real situation is , before he/she tells other people how to read , or tries the new ways of reading , he/she has already failed the universities .finally , a person concertrated on trying new things will overlook the purpose and importance of doing things in this new and risky way .noting knowing how to ride a bicycle , is the question remains untill a person fell down from the racing bicycle or a motorbike .the things people have already know may seem boring , but the day people understand it really well , they can see through their aim of trying new things and will be mote possibly , successfull .hence , it is the most significant for a person to become successful to do things they have already known and do it as great as possible .
