nowadays cars belong to our everyday life .seventy years ago it was an object of social distinction insofar onlly upper class had a car .progressively the situation has changed and cars are become something common for a lot of people even if it is not the case everywhere in the world .in north countries it is not surprising to see three cars in a family .however the situation seems to change once again for different reasons like the lack of petroleum , the pollution or the town s architecture .so , it is very possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the lack of petroleum in the world is one of the reasons that could explained the fact that it is possible to see fewer cars in twenty years .indeed petroleum becomes a really expensive product .if the rise of the prices do nt stop it wo nt be possible for a lot of families to use their cars .a second reason might be highlight .indeed governements are conscious that pollution is a fundamental stake for out planet .so , different policies fight againt greenhouse effect as the treaty og kyoto .furthermore it is obvious that cars are partly responsible of pollution .that s why their use will be more and more restricted .last but not leat the organisation of the towns , like paris , do nt allow to drivein conclusion , in twenty years cars wo nt be used by most of the people .taking the tube ot the bus or a bycicle will be easier and cheaper than taking a car , and better fot the environment .consequently , cars are annouced a difficult future .
