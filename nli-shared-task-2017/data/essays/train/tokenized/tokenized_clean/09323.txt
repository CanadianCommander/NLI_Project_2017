it is often said that older people enjoy life more because they have more money and time to buy something or travel .however , i do not agree with that older people enjoy their lives more than younger people .there are several reasons and examples that young people enjoy life more .to begin with , young people have much better physical condition .they can go wherever they want and do whatever they want .for example , my uncle , who was over 60 , really wanted to try bunge-jump at least one time .but he was too old to do that kind of risky outdoor sports .he regreted that he could enjoy his life more than now if he were young .secondly , young people have more desire about their lives than older people .i believe that dream is a essential factor to feel happiness in their lives .as people age , they tend to lose their dreams because the possibility decreases to fulfill their dreams or goals of life .it often leads to frustration and abandonce about their lives .for instance , a lot of parents in korea sacrifice themselves much for their kids .they have little hope besides their kids .it is almost impossible for them to work more , make more money , or make new friends .in addition , young people can feel happy in thier lives from even small satisfaction .there was one tv program how each generation react to some given events .they were more likely to smile and laugh than older people .they felt happy very easily just because they were more happier people .very small comedy or even trivial action was able to satisfy young people and make them laugh .it shows that young poeple can enjoy almost everything in all situations , in contrast , older people are picky .in short , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people have better reasons and conditions to enjoy life more .they have enough both physical and mental energy to try what they want to .and their desire will encourage them to explore and enjoy their lives vigorously .also they have more tendency of satisfation .
