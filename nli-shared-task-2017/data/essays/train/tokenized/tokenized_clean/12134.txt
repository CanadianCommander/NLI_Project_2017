i have a very close example in my family that it is important to try new things and to take risks .in fact my father has adopted this rule , and he is a succcessful man .but i think that you can try great challenges when you are able to manage all your skills , so to do well some things is necessary to be successful but not enough .moreover i think that to do new things in every situation in our life is an exciting way of life .in fact this approach allows to open the mind and to think with a wide vision .therefore travelling a lot , meeting new people and frequently changing the job is a way to improve ourseves .in fact it is possible to enhance our skills and to solve better every new problem .on the other hand taking risk is an art and a personal skill , but it is essential to become successful .in fact doing a challenging thing and being everey time under pressure probably can extract our best and compete with greater force .i thing that an intresting example of `` taking risks  is napoleon , who was the greater general of history .he was able every time to choice the winning way , which was a non conventional strategy , which presented many risk but also the possibility to gain a great success .he was also able to communicate this approach to his army , so to transform the success of one man , to the success of an entire country .in conclusion i think that an aggressive and competitive approach is the best solution to try to reach success , even if it is also necessary to have some luck .for these reasons , hoping to become a successful man , i ll use this set of suggestions also on my normal life , both on work and during social realtionships .in fact i like competition and taking reasonable risks and i want to learn and do new things every moment .
