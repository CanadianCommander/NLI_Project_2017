in my opinion it is better to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects than to spealize in one specific subject .in our childhood as children we will be interested in different subjects .even in our school we read a wide range of academic subjects because all are essential in our life as we grow up .specialization in one subject will not help us to do whatever we want and to achieve pinnacle of success .we need different subjects such as mathematics , history , physics , chemistry , literature and many other subjects in our day to day life .without one subject also we cant proceed .for exampleif i do specialization in physics and donot know other subjects at all then there is no meaning to my interest at all .i need to literature when i hav to converse with people and for counting money and all i must know maths .so each and every subject is interlinked with each other .it also makes studying easier by doing different subjects rather than sitting with one subject .with the knowledge of different academic subjects we can achieve immense knowlendge in various streams .we will be aware of the worldly progresses and new inventions or discoveries .even the great scientists of the world had an idea of the different subjects .for example marie curie discovered the effect of radioac tive substances and the cure for the cancer .its soleley not chemistry which she applied in the discovery .there is a lot of physics and maths also involved in it .there are many advantages of knowing different subjects .some people do specializations in art , literature , etc.but they should be aware of other subjects .learnind different subjects will include a lot of curiosity and general knowledge of a person .it will motivate an individual to adopt innovative thinking and to get exposed to the world .so i conclude by telling that there are many advantages of having a knowledge of different subjects rather than a single boring subject .
