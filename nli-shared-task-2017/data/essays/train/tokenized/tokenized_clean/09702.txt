most advertisements seem to make products seem much better than they really are .most advertisement seems to emphasize too much of their benefits or vital points in their products .to make the advertisements more effective , people work for the advertisements use more color , put overstatements about the products in good way , and use popular actors , actresses , and even singers to make the effects bigger .in general , customers should not believe in too much for the advertisements itself .i have two examples to show how the way advertisements work .one is that the advertisement of camel cigarette , there are actually two advertisements paper for men and women .but the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beautiful and look cool with the cigarette on its both advertisement .the advertisements want consumers to think to be looked cool or even mature when they smoke like the model on its advertisements .the other example is about nutrition pills .there are many kinds of pills or powders such as diet pill , protein powder , omega 6 pills , etc and its advertisement affects people greatly .those advertisement make people think their body look not nice even if they really do not , and let them buy those pills to loose weight or make mascle .some people might believe if they take big amount of protein powder , they would make huge muscle which they want .however , the truth is they can not .those protein powder does not help to make more muscle .people who buy the protein power are just waisting their money .people can buy anything they want in this society .however , many of them do not realize how they are affected by those advertisement when they go shopping and choose things to buy .customers have to know only what they really need to buy , but not for the products they think atractive because of its advertisement .be a smart shopper .
