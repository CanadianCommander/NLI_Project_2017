`` it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .i disagree about this statement .when i was child really i could agree above the statement .but now everything changed .in our time students want to learn reality .students especially nowadays can learn a lot different subject from different sources .these sources can be internet or television .and also foreign countries television can be watched fron students and they can see different point of views .also some countries they can learn real history of their countries and war reasons .after that at class students can ask teacher some questions about fact .before this was not , when teacher whatever says students can take this idea or concept .for example before i learnt from my teacher about first world war , according to his statements ; we lost the war because our alliens lost .but now i learnt the facts from different sources especially foreign sources everything is different .all my ideas and concepts confused .globalization started in the world .after globalization lectures , teachers or speakers any meetings or any speaking places must pay attention every sentence .students now can questioned every word and every idea .therefore , giving lectures all the time should developed their knowledges .students can make for searching because of much spare time .teachers can not much time for searching time because marriage and having children can stop them .consequently , all the time lecturers shoul leran facts all the subjects especially about history because now every human-being can reach every knowledge or every country all over the world .they can also meet a lot different countries people and they can learn from them , from television , from internet every reality and facts .because the world is globalizationing .
