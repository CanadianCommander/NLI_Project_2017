as people grow older their interests may change .whether young or old , each generation has each ammusement .however i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons .first of all , generally speaking , young people have less careful to their health than old people do .as people grow older the possibility that they become sick would become increase .in hospital there are too many older people who consult in doctor for many reasons .as opposed to that , young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere .health is the most dearest thing of all .second of all , young people has not their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan of the future easily .old people cannnot never change their job or their partner of marriage .it makes the life of old people boring and less exciting .in addition to that old people have heavy responsibility for their job and their family .in contrast , young people have much time in the future ; they can draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream .finally young people , perticularly young women can enjoy fasion and cosmetics .in the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women .this means that young people tend to enjoy fahionable life and fashion brands target not old woman but young woman .young woman can spend more many fashion that old woman do because young woman can use their many freely .and as people get older they get their weight more easily that they were young and they cannnot wear the closethes that were fit to them when they were young .young people enjoy their life tma
