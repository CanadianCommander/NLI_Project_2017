to do or not to do ??in our lifes we drop in many unintended situtations .we try to solve many times and go on at the same point to do the best .or most of us keep to do the best thing we could do without taking risks but we know that we would do it well .ca nt we face our worsts when we wanted ?is the matter to show what best you do or what you can do ?everything starts with ourself in our mind with being generous and brave to life .maybe we strongly need to be more different not to according to ur confessions , according what we need to do .if you say that it s far away from me to change your same way sometimes and to open new doors to yourself what you are able to do , now it should be the time to show your abilities without any fair but with taking risks and bad results .everytime you want to see good answer after doing something ?how much will it satisfy you ? .you must do the things what you cant be able to do and need to take risks when you built your own chart .as if you think that you cant do the things which seem bigger .unless you dont try to do new things and taste the bad things , you cant get the best one , you just get it as it satisfied you or you are supposed to do .sometimes all of us need change and get some experinces from all the thing what goes on our life .you need to be curious to reach the point where you can be , you need to try and understand which you dont know how to it well .absolutely it will add you many things as you faced your capabilities .dont wait the time or dont wait it to come in front of you .you go and keep it without any suspections and obsessions .every new things make to born new thing .success always hides beside you .if you do not walk on the new path you always go and come back at the same way you walked before .see the dark feel the dark , learn how to use your light . ..give chance to new doors maybe it s a love and maybe it s a life maybe who knows , to a unlimited success . ..be the change one to be everywhere . ..
