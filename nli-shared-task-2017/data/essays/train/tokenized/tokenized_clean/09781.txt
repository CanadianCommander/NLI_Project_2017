nor fate nor chance nor any star commandssuccess and failiure not but lies in your handsthis is the mantra that seems have driven successful people over the year .continuous improvement and the quest for it is the single most important factor that drives people to achieve the impossible .how much ever a person likes a particular thing and however brilliant he might be at it , if the need to improve continuously is lacking he would ultimately be bored of such a job and will fail to give his best .the very fundamental truth of life revolves around the fact `` no risk no return .the leading example of a successful man is mahatma gandhi , a person who could have easily chosen to lead a simple and happy life as a lawyer in south africa .however , he chose to come back to india and fight for freedom of his people against all odds .without his determination and guidance india would not have been freed .another example would be mother teresa who worked day after day to help the poor and the underprivelaged .as any other human being she could have chosen to lead a normal and happy life but that would have made all of us call her a motherto explore new opportunities one needs to go out of his way and face uncertain circumstances and figure out ways to emerge victorious .only when one believes that failiure is not an option in an uncertain environment would he actually give his cent percent and emerge successful .as necessity is the mother of all invention taking risks and being exposed to an uncertain atmosphere is the main element necessary to becoming succesful .however , taking on new risks and challenges is not the only ingredient in making a successful man .it should be combined with other qualities like willingness to learn , courage and above all belief in himself .this stresses on an important concept called calculated risks , which effectively mean risks which a person needs to take in a planned way .the problem should be analyzed and then broken down into components , and each component should then be individually attacked .
