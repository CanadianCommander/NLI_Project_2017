i had a trip to che-ju island in my country , korea , with my friends , and it was a trip that led by a tour guide .after the journey , there were more bad memories than good ones , because of these reasons ; caanot choosing visit places , and the problem of extra fees .for my experiences , i disagree with the opinion that the tour group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .first of all , people robbed their rights to choosing the spots to visit , if the travel team is organezed and led by a tour guide , people of the the team have to follow the schedule which is made by the guide .for example , i could nt visit the museum which exhibit the numerous kinds of unique plants grown only in han-ra mountain in che-ju island .instead of that , we merely followed the typical travel courses like teddy bear museum , and restaurants that sells black pig .how waste of time !!i can see such a thing not only in the island , but in my town .to follow the schedule we had to sacrifice our right to decide where to go .in addition , going travel with a guide is too costly .there are many so called ` options  that we can choose whether we will experience it or not .however , in reality , the ` options  are not option as it means literally .the guide makes people to do , or sometimes buy something madatorilly .and of coures it is not conclued in the travel fee people already paid .to illustrate this , a tv program in korea revealed the reality of the ` option  system .they research about that , and conducted a survey to the people who experience the guide tour .most of them did nt wanted to do the program , but compelled to do that by the reason that if someone does nt participate alon , then he or she will break the harmony of the team .furthermore , about 90 % of them disappointed to the cost , and quality of the optional programs they had experienced .it shows how expensive to tour with a guide .in conclusion , i disagree with the view that the tour with guide is the best way of travel , because we can not go where we wish to go , and have to pay for the extra fees for optional program , as for me who experienced such a bad-memoried-trip , i am planning to go euroup next summer with my own preparation , and organization .even though it is hard to prepare , it will bestow me happier memories , and allows me to save money .
