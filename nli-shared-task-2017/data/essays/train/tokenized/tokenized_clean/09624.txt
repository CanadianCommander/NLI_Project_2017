succesful poeple are poeple who do things well .what is difficult is to know in advance if it is a good or a bad thing .but how can we manage to be a succesful person .you have to take risk .of course you have to be quiet sure of your action .but what is fare more inportant is to believe in yourself .for exemple if you are a good singer but that you do nt believe in yourself you can be sure that you will never become a famous star .of course taking always risk can be dangerous specially when you like it .for exemple somebody who likes going to the casino may loose a lot of money , so in this case taking risk is nt a good thing .in fact you must find balance .to be successful means also trying new things .but new things are not always good , you have to try before beeing sure it is a good idea .but in fact what is really inportant is to learn of your mistakes .for exemple if you try to passe an exam but that you failled what is important is to learn of your mistake so it will not happend again .by using this way of thinking you will learn a lot of things and than will be able to do them well .but to become somebody successful you have to take risk and try new things because otherwise you will never learn how to do things well
