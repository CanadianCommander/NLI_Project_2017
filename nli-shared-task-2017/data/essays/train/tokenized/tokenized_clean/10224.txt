i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i support my position on the following arguments :i think that every stage in life has a special feature that makes it different .on the one hand , young people like to travel , spend time with friends hanging out , practicing sports and doing other activities proper to their age , which is perfectly good .it is the perfect stage of life to learn , experience and recognize the values that were transmited to us .it is also a period in which young people could enjoy the opportunity to demonstrate their affection and love to older people , knowing that some day they will also get older and in demand of affection and attention .in other words , it is a life period that always will be remembered , but that also has to be spent with care and responsability .on the other hand , older people become more family oriented , traying to spend more time with their relatives and the loved ones .it is natural , their priorities in life have changed , but it does not mean that they do not enjoy life anymore , on the contrary , they enjoy life on their own way .even though it is true that older people become more and more dependant from relatives and other people , it is also true that this is an efficient and human way for us to show them our appreciation for what they have done in their lifes .this is also a great chance for them to witness the love that their relatives may show and feel .in sum , i believe that young people as well as older people are totally able to enjoy life in their own way and considering the characteristics of both different human stages .thus , i do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
