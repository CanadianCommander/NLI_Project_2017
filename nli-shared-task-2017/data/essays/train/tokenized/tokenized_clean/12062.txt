i disagree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .i believe that specializing and concentrating in a single specific subject is far more important for two reasons .first , our life is limited .we do nt have enough time to learn about every topics or subjects during our lifetime .if we can live for five hundred years as turtle does , we can study and learn almost every accessible subjects that we need to know .however , the real is not .for example , if all students are educated in purpose of having broad knowledge without any indept specific knowledge about science , they might understand how machines operates but they can not fix in case the machines stop or are destroyed .we do not want our children to have only shallow knoweldge in many subjects without their own specialties .second , i strongly believe that being equipped with specialized knowledge may result in inspiring people from using the specific knowledge and applying the knowledge to various other areas .in my case , i have been very interested in collecting butter flies in every different kinds since i was five years .this hobby made me read the related books and articles about insects as much as i could .as i know about the insects more , i was more deeply inspired from their behaviosr .as a result , i expanded my hobby to my major in college : biology .in conclusion , i think focusing on a specific topic has a lot more advantages than being a only generalist .since our life span is limited and society is well diversified , we need more specialist than shallow generalist .also our culture and technology will be beneficial from the people who have profound , indepth knowledge on specific subject as the society s environment become more complicated .
