i agree with the statement .infact i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people because they find it more interesting , they still have to affront many life s problems , they still have to feel every sensation , they still have to know how life could be horrible sometimes , they still have to know a lot of life-s part that old people already know .for example sometimes my mother tell me how i could affront a problem because she have already affronted a situation like mine and i love when she does it .everyday young guys and girls feel that there is a big and awesome world in front of them which is waiting them .i love this sensation .i love have a lot of dreams about my future , i like think that i can do what i want about my life because everything depends by me .i know that it s not like this , there are a lot of problems that i will have to affront during my life , but i prefer to convince myself that with my forces i ll be able to arrive where i want to .old men and women believe that their life is an habit ; for example , they already know what they will do next summer because they will do what they did last year and the year before .i want that my mother and my father understand that they are still young , they have to live their life as i uually do with mine .what they usually tell me about my life are important informations for me to resolve my problems , but they have to enjoy their life .for example they could go away for two days without me and my brother or they could change habits and go out for dinner sometimes .when they talk about what they did when they where younger i can see how much they miss that period and i feel bad . ..maybe next christmas i could ask to the big man , as we call him to remember to my parents
