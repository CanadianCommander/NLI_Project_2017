what do people usually use to guide them when they are traveling ?i remember two years ago , my friends and i went to new orleans , louisiana for a trip .before we left , we went online to find all the attractions in the area .however , we got lost so many times because we did not know the area ; nor did we have a tour guide .therefore , i agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because having a tour guide will decrease the chance of getting lost , and it will be less likely to get involved in an accident .first of all , having a tour guide when traving will decrease the chance of getting lost .a lot of people , when they go to a certain area for the very first time , inspite of having a map , have the tendency to get lost .one reason for that is because sometimes the maps that they got online are not updated .hence , they get lost on the roads , which can cause them to be angry .i remember while my friends and i were on our way to a mall , despite the fact that we followed all the directions in the map , we still got lost .but , we had a tour guide , perhaps , we would not have lost .besides having less chance of getting lost when traveling with a tour guide , the possibility of getting an accident is also low .in florida , it is said that lots of people die when they go visit a place due to car accidents .the reason why is by looking at the map while they are driving .but if they had a tour guide who knows the area very well , they would be less likey to crash .thus , a tour guide would be very helpul when traveling .in conclusion , i am strongly in favor of the idea of having a guide when traveling .for , this will minimize the chance of getting lost and getting an accident .
