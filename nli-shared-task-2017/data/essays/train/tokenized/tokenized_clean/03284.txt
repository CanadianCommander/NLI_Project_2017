young people usually cost lots of time on computer , cell phone and go out for fun besides school and work time .but i do nt think it means they do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think the communities ca nt separate form the common actives and people .young people can learn a lot in friends , computer and somthing or someone they meet in life .for example , i always cost a lot of time on computer and interenet .i met many kinds of people online i will not find at school .i always can find new things from them .and i can aways get the news online when i want .but in the eyes of other people , maybe i just play the computer all dat and do not give enough time to helping my community .that is why i do not think young people they do not give enought time to helping their communities .i think they just change their ways to do it .
