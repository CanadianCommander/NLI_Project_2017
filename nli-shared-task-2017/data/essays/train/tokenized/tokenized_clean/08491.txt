i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .one particular example is what i am currently observing in my community .i live in a residential area with my family which is close to shinjuku , a sort of entertaining center of tokyo .a month ago , the plan to build a huge studio-type apartment complex next to my place was revealed .this new apartment is mainly targeting to people without family who work and study in shinjuku .as the area is very close to the entertaining area , it is much assumed that many of those who work as hosts and hostesses at bars may live in the apartment .then , the big dispute occured and many people living in the community started to organize a movement to oppose to this plan .they say that this apartment will greatly damage the living condition of the people in the community .they meet regularly , prepare posters and friers and consult with local politicians and lawyers in order to figure out how to stop the plan .however , none of the young people living there , including me , have not joined or even helped this community-wide opposition movement .people who have been actively involved are those who are over 60s .given this personal experience , i wonder why young people nowadays are not eager to help their communities .first , i think young people have less attachment to the communities they live in .for example , i know i will live at a different place when i have a job somewhere else .for young people , communities are not permanent , while for older people communities are where they live until they die .second , i believe that young people simply do not have enough time to help their communities .they work long hours and have various commitments to other `` communities  they belong to , such as work place , schools , virtual space on the internet and friends .and they know that using their precious time on these `` communities  can make their lives more exciting and interesting than they do so for their real communities .to sum up , i agree with the statement and i also think this is not something that we can easily change .
