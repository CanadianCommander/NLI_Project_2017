i strongly believe that each subject you learn has a long lasting contribution on your life and on your personality .my dream is to learn and know everything in order to bring myself to the fullest potential , the question is : is that possible ?in fact , it is not !our life is too small for acieving a dream like mine with all the other issues surrounding us and need our care and time .furthermore , different subjects may not always be in the same field , e.g : physics which is an essential subject in the sciences field does not match history - a part of the humanities family .in conclusion it is better for us and for our precious world and time to take a one way decision that we will take for our future according to our personality , self image , tendincies , capability and all the other requested needed information .specializing in one acadimic field and not subject is the most essential for me , for instance : if i chose a way that is most suitable for me and wish to pass it then i have to take a look on all the subways and instructions and neither pass it straightly nor blindly .i other words if i chose to specialize in aerospace engineering then i must have a wide look on the other branches like physics , chimistry , mathematics ...at last i want to point that this section of argument is so wide and complicated but virtual , what happens in the real world is that we go with the river , we finish our school with an unefficient material , register for the university with no clear image to all the fields that may fit us and then ...then we are in the hands of distiny .
