i do nt agree with the idea that the best way of traveling is to join a group led by a tour guide for several reasons .first of all , no matter how many people are contributing to the group , hiring a tour guide is always a lot more pricy than traveling by yourself or with a friend or two .indeed , i find these tours as tourist traps because the tourists pay double or triple price when they visit museums with the ` knowlegable  tour guides , compared to the amount they pay at the door .for example , i went to moscow last year and at the kremlin palace i noticed that the visitors are given two options , either you can hire a guide at the door for an outrageous price or you buy an audio guide for only three dolars .is nt it obvious which one makes more sense ?some people might argue that a tour guide has a lot of information about the city that is being visited , so it is essential to be led by one .however a well-writen guide book would compensate the need for a tour guide and these guide books could easily be obtained from the bookstores or even tourist information offices .recently these guide books are being written by locals of the place and they contain all the valuable information that a visitor may need .furthermore they are being updated as new places open or anything changes in the place .also traveling with a group has the inevitable disadvantage of moving as a group .despite of the fact that each individual has there own interests and their own preferences , the group has a certain schedule for the entire trip and mostly it is required to follow this schedule .this requirement leds people to see places that they have no interest in and in a way it turns the trip into an unpleasent event .
