i strongly agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because i have observed that nowadays everybody is occupied with her or himself .for example last month i had a terrific accident and i was not able to attend my classes so i was depending on the helping hands of my classmates .but although they recognized my absence knowbody was willing to help me with my homework .that was an hardtime experience for me .thus , i have many friends i felt so alone .another good example is the behaving towards older people .i sometimes sit in and overcrowed bus and an old woman is coming in but nobody besides me wants to stand up and offer the woman his or her seat .that makes me sad .or helping old people with their housework would be a good possibility to pay attention to them but nobody has time to do this because of a full activity plan .to my opinion every person should treat the other person like he himself wants to be treatend by someone else .that means when you are observing that your neighbour needs help then do not hesitate to help him because next time probabily you will need his help .the most important thing to me are the people who suround me for example my parents , frieds and neighbours .and therefore i always try to keep my eyes open and help them when they are in need because i now know how it feels to be without help .for me it is also clear that i would help oder older people in any occasion because when i am old i need the others help to .to sum it all up i strongly believe that young people should change their attitudes towards other people by spending more attention to the needs of other people .so that they will change from selfish young people to ones who pay attentin to their friends , neighbours and to all other people .
