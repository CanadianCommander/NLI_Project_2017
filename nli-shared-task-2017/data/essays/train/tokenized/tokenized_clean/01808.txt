as the touring company is more popular resently , the students in the school , some communities and some groups of families go on trip with a tour guide .i agree with the passage , `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  i will give following two reasons why trip with the tour guide is best way .in the first , tourists can deepen the knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide .most tourists is not fammilier with the place ; they do nt know about the language people speaks and history , what manner and behaivor people respects and so on .therefore , tourists is necessary to inform tourists what intresting there are ; as a result , they have fun in the place .next , tourists needs the tour guide who leads there .they may lose their way , and be in troble with the paticular language and culture .for example , american childreen who go to singapore recieved a heavy panishment in order to not follow the rule there : they throw their gum in the public place .if a tourist was along with them and teach singapore s rule to them , they would nt be in the troble there .therefore , the best way to travel is group led by tour guide in which tourists should have fun the travel in a patucular place .they can learn about the place more and do nt in trouble term of the tour guide .
