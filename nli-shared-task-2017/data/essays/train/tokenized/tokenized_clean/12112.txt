time is the most effective heal for hurt ; it is not an exaggeration to say that flowing time brings one experience , maturity , and satisfaction .by undergoing obstacles during their lifetime , people can enjoy their lives wiser and easier .some people say that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do , considering that young people enjoy to challenge on new things , such as bunge jumping or accessing to millions of web sites .however , other people argue that older people enjoy their lives more thoughtfully and wisely , based upon knowledge obtained from various and numerous early experiences that they had before .no one can deny that young people have high spirits and love of challenge or innovations .they seem as if they are enjoying life most thoroughly ; they sing whenever they want to , eat whatever they want to , and chat wherever they want to .elderlies do not : they like sitting on rocking chairs , reading newspaper in peaceful minds , and knitting while watching sunset .they are quieter than younger people , but know how to enjoy simple things around them , which younger people would consider `` boring everyday life  .older people enjoy what youngsters consider unenjoyable .they entertain themselves in most simple , but peaceful ways , considering their life experiences .time can be a heal , but it can work as a shortcut to entertainment .older people , who had more time and experience compared to younger people , tend to enjoy their life in their own ways , peacefully and thoughtfully .
