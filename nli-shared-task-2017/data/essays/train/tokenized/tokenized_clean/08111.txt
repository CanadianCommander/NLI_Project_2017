i completly agree with the sentence .i m a student and i think that is more important to understand all the concepts and all ideas .basing on my experience i think that is more important understand all the ideas and all the concepts of a topic or of a lecture .in my opinion if something is over your head it is important ask a questions , to understand anything .a mounth ago , i was in an antropology class and my professor was discuss a topic .this topic was over my head and i did nt understand nothing .at home i studied my notes and at the next lessons i asked to my professor to explain me the point that i was nt understand .i think that , in the university world , there are a different way to ask something to a professor .in my university all students can contact their professor by e-mail , by phone or apply for an appointment .another thing that is very important for my experince is understand the reason of wich i study something .in all the lectures of the university professors these professor must explain all the reason of wich the students study the topics of the lectures .in a human factor design course my professor say that we wil study antrophometry , human behaviour , human computer interaction and human machine interaction .so we will be able to use the information of these sciences to design a good object , good space and good buildings .i think that is more important study anithigs .i think that is more important ask if we do nt understand something .we can use e-mail , phone and all the tecnology that we know .also i think that is more important understand why we are going to study something .
