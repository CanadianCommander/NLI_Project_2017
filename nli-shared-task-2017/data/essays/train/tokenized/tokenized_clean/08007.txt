i would agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .there is a saying that `` experience is the best teacher  .a person who is very successful must experience more in different ways and learn how to survive in different environment and not afraid of risks .i will explain my opoins from the following aspects .first of all , one of the most important character that a successful person should have is curiousity and a desire about learning new things .normally a new opportunity , new atmosphere and new people around can bring new sense and new pentientail for a person .for example , a very famous chinese writer lu xun .he used to be a doctor , but he realized that doctor can only treat people s sick instend of thinking .so tried to start writing article and book , then his books influenced a generation of chinese in 1920s .secondly , as a successful person , he must be very brave and taking risks in all different circumstances .for example , chairman mao is a tipical successful leader who was always taking risks in this world .he led chinese people to stand up and build a new country in the east asia .thirdly , i do nt think that a person who always keeps a position and never try new things in his life will be successful .keeping doing one thing for long time , people will become lazy and increative .they just want to do the daily things and never think about do some different from others .on the other hand , i also think that persistance is an very important character that a successful person should have .for example , a scientist is doing lots of study and research focusing on specific fields and progects .the job itself requires that he must know how to deal with his study and also must know how to do well .it is essencial for a scientist that he must be pacient and concentrate on something instead of trying new things and taking risks .in a nutshell , the successful people should have an couragement and disire for trying new things .it is an important part for a successful person to take risks in order to get new opponities and petential so that he can make a difference in this worls .
