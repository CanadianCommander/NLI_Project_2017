travelling in a group rather than alone is most of the time a difficult decision to take and it involves many personal and external factors : the place you intend to visit , your social preferences , your tolerance for being with other people for long lapses of time , the type of people that will come along for this long trip . ..and many others .i do agree that travelling in a group led by a guide is a good experience in most circumstances .when i intend to visit a large city , an historical site or a country of which i do not speak the language , being led by an experienced guide and togheter with some travelling friends is essential for me .i have the opportunity to learn more about the culture of the city or the country that i am visiting , while discovering pleasures ( i.e. nice restaurants or nice locations ) that i probably could not find with my little written guide .for example , when i was in montreal with my husband we dragged our friends to a `` not pricy and excellent :  restaurant following directions of our useful little guide .surely the food was good , but the not pricy part needed to be discussed ( and our friends offered to pay prior to seing the bill ) .in visiting historical places the role of a guide is even more important .living in venice for many years , i have always been impressed by the amount of information i did nt know about the local churches , and , despite being a local , i enjoyed to join guided groups while walking through the churches .even when travelling in remote places , being in a `` protected  group with a guide that is able to help you with the essential needs is wise .my aunt was in mongolia for 3 weeks , living with nomades in a tent and drinking acidic milk with all her travelling companions , and , once back , she assured me that she would not repeat the same trip without a guide .sometimes however travelling in a group may be frustrating .it requires conciliating needs and desires of different people , while tolerating organizational and travelling issues .probably a good travelling `` social  attitude is the best way to face any trip and to enjoy a good guided trip .and , as a last point , having a good guide makes all the difference !
