i fully agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know .taking risks to achieve something big is what these successful people believe in .they have big dreams .they feel that without taking risks they can not fulfil them .they are not afraid of failing and they expect positive outcome from these risks .typically the people who fall under this category are the bussinessmen .for example to sell his product a successful businessman would use a method like this .he does the entire campaigning and advertising of a new product that he has to sell in a different way .he keeps offers for his customer like `` buy one and get one free  .so by doing this he attracts the customer to his product and thereby increases the sell .he does nt think about the money that he is going to spend by keeping such offers but he thinks about the money he is going to make by using this `` buy one get one free  offer .so the risk here is to give such kind of offer .so this is the outlook of a suuccessful person .they see the positive side of everything .they actually do the same things but they do it differently and thats what makes them different from a ordinary person .now if we think about a not so successful businessman in the same situation he would nt have taken the risk of giving big offers from the fear : what if the customers dont buy my product ?i will be doomed .so he would follow his usual way .even if there is no loss there is no extra gain is what this businessman thinks .but the successful businessman does not fear about the loss and consistently thinks the big profit incase his idea succeeds .
