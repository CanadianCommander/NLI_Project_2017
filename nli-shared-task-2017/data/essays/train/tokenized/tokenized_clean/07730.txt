in normally , as a nature of fact , young people and older people have some different ideas and approaches even to the same situation .therefore , i completely aggree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is because due to the following reasons .to begin with , young people and older people have different attitudes and experiences , so they are not expected to behave similar against the same situation .for instance , young people can try to enjoy life by travelling , dancing , doing so many sport activities such as swimming , tracking , skiing and so on .however , in general , older people think to live a more stable or routine life and they usually do not want to enjoy life by doing whatever young people do .furthermore , young and older people of course have different metabolism which means their hormones are really different to each others  .therefore , one can not usually expect to someone , age of 75 , to make bungee jumping from a skyscraper but as you guess , a young boy try to feel this adrenalin in his vessels by jumping from 250 feet height .moreover , similar to these , young people have no such a hard responsibilities for their families or someone around them .however , many older people are grandmother and grandfather so they always have to think not only themselves but also their childrens and grand children .for example , think a boy , at the age of 15 , he/she can go to a holiday for two or three months with his/her friends because if the schools are closed , they have a great time to make whatever they want , but older people have a limited time to do so .in the ligth of above discussion , last but not at least , i wish to conclude by saying that young people enjoy life more than older people due to their different experiences , different hormonal metabolisms and different responsibilities as well .therefore , as a young and dynamic boy , i try to do whatever and whenever i want because i do not want to say when i am 65 years old that i wish . ..
