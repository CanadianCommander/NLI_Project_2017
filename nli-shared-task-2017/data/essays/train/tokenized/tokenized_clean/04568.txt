i m agree whit this statement .for example , thinking to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertisement that the productors do , is too unreal .they say that if you have this mp3 , you have more opportunities to be considered by your friends , or by other people , that you have something more that give you what other have nt , give you celebrity or more opportunity with the girls or the boys .but this is only an object that beetwen a few months you will change because is out of mode .is nothing special , it ca nt give you everything that they said .the producers use the pubblicity to bring the people , to influenced their choices and for doing it they must invent , they must associate to their object the figure of geat , wonderfull , special even if is a common object .another examples could be rappresent by the use of yogurts for the regularity .in italy there are more societies tha make yogurt to help the people to go to the bathroom , and they say that if you took one of this every day you can get it .but if you try , the quality that them could apport to you is not real how they said .it s dipend from people to people .so we do nt believe in everything that they tell , because there is always someone that tends to tell a lay for having we to his part .
