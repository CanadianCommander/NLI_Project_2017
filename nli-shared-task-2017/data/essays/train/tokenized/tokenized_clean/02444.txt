i am agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , if the advertisement make product more better is in order to encourage people to buy them .in fact , if the television or the radio make many advertise about one product , the consumers will be more attracted and spend more money .it is a good way to sell a product because the most important thing consist to attray people .if the product is very sad or ugly , it is clear that poeple do nt buy it .for example when we saw advertisement on television about fast food , in particular mac donald , the burger seems perfect , i mean that he is bigger than the restaurant s one and seems to have more ingredients but when we go to the restaurant , we have another vision , we have the impression that what we saw at the television is really different than what we have in our plate .this example shows us that if we did nt see the burger on television , we has nt gone at the mcdonalds .the role of the advertissement is to bring us another way to imagine the product and to push us to buy and to spend money .all in today s world is commercial , to spend money is the new way of life and we can see that nowadays that we buy everything even if we do nt need it .buying give us satisfaction and we couldnt live in this world without selling .that s the reason why the medias take the opprtunity to shows us products which seem much better than reality .even if we realise that what we are buying is not the same with what the television shows us we will continue to do it because it is necessary .to conclude , everybody do nt care if the product showed by the advertisement do nt seem like what they really are because the needed is to buy .
