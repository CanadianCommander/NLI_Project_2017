older people enjoy life more than younger people do .from my perspective , the world is made for older people , instead of younger .when you are young you get ignored for what ever you do by olders .also , the world is created because olders made lots of efford to develop the world .when you are older you can experience whatever you like , you can have freedom , and you have power to control youngers .when you are older you can experience what ever you love .you can drink alchol , you can go to anywhere you like , and you can choose what to do for the career .when you are young you are ruled by parents that they only want good , model stuents .they want you to do well in studies , sports and anything .i myself had difficult life when i was young , i was kind of stuck with my parents that , i could nt do whatever i like .when you are older you can have freedom .for as long as you like , you can go the wherever countries you like .if i turn thirty , i want to go around the world and explore different cultures .when you are young your parents want to be with you all the time .they do nt want you to go anywhere but the house .thats what older people can enjoy life more than younger people do .when you are older you have power to control over young people .say , you are police you have power to rule over young people , and teachers can do it too .young people are just the step to be olders .that s why young people can not enjoy life .they are limited to enjoy life .in other hand olders have so much time and energy to enjoy life .also the vision is different , between young people and older people .older people have much more wider views than young people .that s how older people can enjoy their life .these are the reasons why older people are better than young people .older people can experience , have freedon , and have power .world is like the world to older people not for the young people .if young people want to explore better life , they should study hard and may have patience to be older people .older people enjoy life more than young people do .
