technology is in a fast progress .since the invention of the televisions , people have been spending much more time in front of them .as a result , the researchers find out that advertising the products on tvs or on billboards will catch so many people s eyes .but i , personally dont believe the general idea of the community .i dont think the better the product is advertised , the better it is .i want to share my experiences .about a year or a year and a half ago , i bought a set of knives from a television ad , assuming that they are better than my regular knives .although , they were being advertised like even having the ability to cut a wood , it was a total disappointment when i got them .they were not even different from my old knives , and supposed to do the same job .afterall , i began to use them in any case and after 6 months or so , they began to not to be trenchant and had to throw all of them away .they neither cut a piece of wood , nor a tomato at the end .my second experience is about believing or assuming the ad products were better was about a doll for my cousin .she wanted the toy , that was sold in a store , and also advertised on the tvs .as a matter of fact i bought the toy to her and it had broken in few days , while she was playing with it .as a conclusion , however , in the past i used to believe that the advertisements make the product better , i learned that it is not a statement , applying to every case .after all these experiences , i learned to criticise more about the stuff that i am going to buy , and not pay attention to the advertisments .they are not that useful , as they are shown .
