in my opinion advertisements make a product seems better than it really is , so i agree with the statement .in the today s world a great amount of advertisements is given to us , even if we do nt care of them we are often compelled to watch them .i think advertisements can change a person tought about a thing , and for this reason we found advertisements everywhere .it often happens that a person s choice is changed because it had watched an advertisemts .some people buy only things that are showed on television because they are influenced by advertisements .advertisements make them think that these products are better than the others .fortunately i am not really this type of person because i do nt care of advertisements , just because i know that they could change my decisions .so when i have to buy something , i ponder my decision and i look for the best price and the best object without thinking to what was showed on television or said in a radio program .i do nt follow advertisements for another reason : all objects showed on them are more expensive than others of the same type .that is because of the cost of the advertisements , but these cost seems to be repaied by the influence that advertisements have in people s opinion .when i look for buy something i always budget my money and i choose less expensive objects rather than more expensive ones , which are always the ones showed all day long in advertisements .in conclusion , i think a great part of the people is influenced by advertisements , which make products seem to be much better than they really are , but i think that people have to choose with their own head and must not follow advertisements seen on television or heard from the radio .
