i believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .specially as the student start to progress in his knowledge , ideas and concepts should become more and more relevant than facts alone .even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requires us to learn facts before understanding them , it is clearly of higher importance to understand the concept as whole .in fact , understanding the concepts is the only way to apply all the facts we learn .for instance , in my working experience i have noticed how two different persons aproach problems .the first one tries to memorize the solutions and does not care about the underling reasons of the problem .the second one reaserches the facts for the superior task of understanding the problem as a whole .clearly the second one always comes with new and suported ideas on how to resolve the situation , however , the first one is always talking about specific information that does not help the solution at all .another example of the higher importance understanding ideas have over learning facts is the following .when there is a complete understanding of the concept you can apply the same concept to a similar situation regardless of the different facts you may encounter .addittionally , the sum of ideas and concept can even form a more complete and complex reasoning for a wide variety of situations .on the contrary , the sum of facts would not lead us to the same aplication regarding diferent situations .the fact that ideas and concepts are of higher value is the only fact students should have on their minds as they progress in their knowledge .i definatly believe it is more important for studentes to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
