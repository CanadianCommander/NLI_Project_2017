in the following text i discuss the question if in twenty years are fewer cars in use than today .first of all you have to take into consideration the country you are talking about , because i am sure it is too difficult to discuss the development of car sales for all over the world .in my case , i am going to talk about the amount of cars in germany .as far as i know , germany is already one of the countries that has a very high rate of car users .that is why it becomes harder to sell more and more cars .moreover it is important to know that cars are not cheap at all .thus , the wealth of a country influences the car sales as well .in germany there is one more factor .the greens are an important power in the german government .that can be explained by the wish of minimizing the pollution .people do not want to see their children growing up in a world full of cars which pollute the air .on the other hand scientists always try to improve the quality of cars and it is possible , that they will invent a car which will not pollute our environment anymore .so i am sure , such a car would lead to more cars in twenty years .one huge disadvantage of cars is the trouble on the streets .in my opinion it is horrible to cross a bigger city like berlin or london by car .it usuallz takes several hours and even if you have been in a good mood , you will be in a very bad mood after the third traffic jam .compared to cars it is so much more comfortable to take the underground in a big city .more and more young people want to live in the city and they grew up with ideas of how to avoid pollution and that is why i think in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
