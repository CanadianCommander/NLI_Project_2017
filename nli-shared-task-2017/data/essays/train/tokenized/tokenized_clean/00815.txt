from my point of view , it would be really an impressive option to have the better knowledge of many academic subjects .as far as i m concerned i think it would be splendiferous in improving several academic topics , besides they could increase the general knowlege and also creates splendid improvement in the case of different subject skills .but in the case of a unique subject provides the improvement in only one subject .in this instance , let s consider an example , if we presume a student who is concentrating in only one subject , consider political science .he might be thorough in only his concerned subject then he might not get any additional skills towards other subjects .when in the case of another student who is concentrating in different kinds of subjects , in this hypothetical case the student definitely gets familiar in many topics that he had read .if we presume some of the topics choosen by the student would be from software engineering technics , embedded systems , japenese literature , data mining and ware housing . ..so on , through his streunous attempt towards learning thse topics would yeild him several sponteneous achievements by educating him inthose subjects .so educating in so many academic subjects would overweigh towars the results brought up by the single subject , because the specialization on many academic subjects outputs the spectacular and magnificient and picturesque results .and student must feel amour propre towards him .eventually , i conclude that taking several academic subjects in order to get specialization in some subjects all at a once such as , political sciences , japanese literature , software engineering techniques , embedded systems , data mining and warehousing , the student would get the out standing benifits by getting skills , rather than the student practicing in only one subject .eventhough he could get the broad knowle
