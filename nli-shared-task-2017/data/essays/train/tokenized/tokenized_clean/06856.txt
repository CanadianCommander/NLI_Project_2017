i agree with the following statement .i have two reasons why i agree .the first reason is because the fuel is getting expensive .as everybody know , the fuel in the earth which are used in large amount of machines and buildings are getting less .so the gasolin which provide energy for car is also getting expensive .then the people who uses car will stop using car so often , and start to walk or use bus or train .the second reason why i think the car in use will be fewer , is bacause of the enviroment problems .the dioxigen which is include in the exaust from the car , is damaging the ozon which is covering the earth .and it is still been damaged .to stop damaging it , people have to stop providing dioxigen .so people will have to stop using car so often .this is the two reasons why i agree the statement .
