i may agree with the statement or may desagree .the enjoying in life depends of young people and older , like elderly people .young people would rather to spend time on computer than to read a book if they have had the oppotunity to choice between them .the most f elderly people might choice to read a book , and another younger people may choice any way .young people like child or teenagers migth expect life to show many ways to make them happy or funny .that is why there are in their minds how come they spend good time and easy life .they have their parents or tutor support their studies and even support life style and they are not able to spend these kind of things . .in the other hand , older people should make ends meets to life , if they did colect enough money , or life by their jobs , depends the case .most of them have on their mind the way to spend life , that is way , they do not expected the life to show an enjoy life .they might think to spend a good life trying to enjoy , however it is too difficult , enjoy and spend good life everytime , than the most of young people are able to get .the psicology of both kind of person are quite different , but in same cases older people could get good life and enjoy life .their jobs and professions get to them a nice way to life .
