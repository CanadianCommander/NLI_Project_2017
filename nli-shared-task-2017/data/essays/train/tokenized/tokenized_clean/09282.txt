does young people enjoy life more than older people do ?by :oscar acevedowhen a people grows and start developing the sence of joy in their lifes , is the moment when we start thinking about it and we start to wonder .is this going to be better whe i m older ?am i too old for this and i want to go back to my early youth ?during our youth and childhood we play , we run , we scream and we walk the world without any worry in our lifes , but this is not the top of it and that s not the end of the road some more experiences come to us and they make us grow as persons and they make us happy in certain moment .young people has the chance to go out with friends , practice sports , more chances to meet people and more time to live .but is in this moment when i belive that older people has an advantage over young people , and this advantage comes when older people is able to remember all those fun times and all that adventures that they have had , is in that moment when people can start enjoying life and make a compilation of all the pat moments and also be able to share it with some other person , some friend that they have made during their youth .when we see a kid playing in the palyground we think of how much this little person is enjoying time and how much this this person has to enjoy in the future , even when young people has no debts , has less problems and has no big responsabilities , an older person can take the best of all that and make it a good experience and a good memory .joy is not how much we are doing now and how many fun moments we are having , joy is how good we can feel with ourselves by the past thing we have done , by the good things we have lived and why not to mantione it for the bad experiences that have lefted a lesson in our lifes .i belive that a person has to realice of what could be a possible future , how is this person going to get it , and when a person can reach that goal and is able to accomplish it .there we can call the real joy of life and the real moment of happines .is for that reason that i disagree with the statement and i support the idea that older people ejoy more their life than young people .
