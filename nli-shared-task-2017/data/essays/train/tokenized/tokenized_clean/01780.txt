advertisements have become an important part of our daily life .we rely so much on the advertisements and bring the product to use it .but , most of the advertisements make the products look much better that what they really are .i totally agree to this .i have heard lots from people about the superficial advertisements whose products are really bad and i have too experienced it .there are lot of hair related products like shampoos , conditioners and hair styling products of different brands .i have dry and weak hair .i happened to see an add for shampoo for dry and weak hair .there advertisement poised a model having silky and strong hair after using it .so relying on the advertisement i bought that shampoo and used it but to my surprise i didnt get even okay results .basically they try to sell their products by making progandas about the product but actually it is not satisfying at all .lets consider the example of fitness intruments .the advisements shows that if you will use this product you will loose so much pounds , if you will use that product you will loose some more pounds .since in us obesity is the major problem , so people rely on these adds and bring home the instruments .they do loose some of pounds but it not the same pounds they show in adverstisements .in most of the adverstisements , they will just show beautiful models and celebrities to make their add fancy than it actually is .i want to tell one of my friends experience about the cell phone service .she took one cellphone service watching its advertisement talking about the better quality of phone calls and best customer care services .but she is repenting her decision of using that service because of bad voice quality and more worse is their customer support .in my opinion , not all but most advertisements tend to make their product look better that what it really is .so , in my view we should not blindly rely on these advertisements rather we should learn more about the product and should compare with other products .
