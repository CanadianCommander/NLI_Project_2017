today , there are many advertisements all around in our lives , and the purpose of them are attracting customers to buy products which advertisements are about .but it also causes many problems in this society , such as some customers do not believe that advertisements are telling them truth of products .i personally disagree with the statement , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the reasons i doubt it are listing below .first , as the tochnology gets better nowadays , advertisements can be made with many techniques , such as made by computer with many fantasy stuff .while customers think that this advertisement is fantasy , it really doesn not mean that it doesn not tell them the truth of the products that the advertisement is about .and the most important thing is that advertisement is just a advertisement , it does not force customers to buy products .second , the people who think that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are probably just make misunderstanding before they buy products .and it really should not be companies  fault because they do this is just for selling their products .customers have rights not to believe what advertisements say , buy they should not say every advertisement is not real .it would be really unfair to the people who have spent a lot of time working on how to make good advertisements .whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not , it depends on different people and everyone has different thinkings about it .
