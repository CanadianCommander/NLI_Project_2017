i do nt believe this question can be answered by yes or no .it all depends on the people , on the activities of these people and in the period they live in .in the industrial revolution for example , you had to try something new to be successful because the activities were changing .an activity in which one might have performed well suddenly got surpassed and that person was forced to change his activity .the people who made the right changes became rich , others who had put their bets on the wrong horses became poor .in the actual time both ways are possible to become successful .the first way would be to stick to something you know you can do well , but you have to do it better than everybody else .that usually is nt possible without investments and the risks that go with it .so i think that , in most cases , there is no success without taking risks .another path to success would be to try something new .in that case the risks are usually higher , but if it was the right thing to do , the rewards are higher too .the difficulty here is that you have to get into the right thing at the right time .the advantage by trying something new is that if the new thing does nt launch off , you can still go back to what you can do well .if that happens you probably wo nt get really successful , but you have tried .but to try something new is nt possible to everybody .to get into a new thing requests the right ideas and much bravery .most people stay in what they re doing , even if they re unhappy , because they do nt have the guts to make a change .in conclusion i would say that the most important factors for success are bravery , to take risks ; luck , to be in the right activity at the right time , the character to want to be better then the others and fantasy , to have the ideas .of course , you also need the skills to then lead your activity to success .
