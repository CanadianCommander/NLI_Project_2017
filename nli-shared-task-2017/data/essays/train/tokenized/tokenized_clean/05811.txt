there are several reasons why i think that young people nowadays give enough time to help their community , most of them based in my own personal experience , that makes me completely disagree with the statement setted .in first place , we have to distinguish between periodic help to the community and flunctuant help to the community .the first one is help of young people almost in a weekly basis and with a very high grade of compromise .the second one is help given when certain natural disasters such as tsunamis or floodings arise .looking back throughout what i have been witnessing in this particular topic during the last 10 years , it is pretty clear for me that young people are involved in their community in a periodic basis .just a small example of this may be a program hold in my university which consists on young people living with old people who live alone and need help .of course there is an advantage for the young people from the program such as not having to pay a rent , but the really important thing of this program is that they are helping the community , helping the old people , helping their families and in general , helping society to become much more involucrated in the needs of the community .there are also many examples of non periodic help such as those of natural disasters .when that happens you always see plenty of young people moving to get food or clothes but not only in their own countries , but also moving themselves to wherever the disaster has occurred .an example of this is the tsunami held in asia a couple of years ago , again in my university , you could see every single student organization moving in order to get money , food , clothes or medicines .so , to sum up and as i have argued before , young people make lots of efforts to help their communities and they really give many of their free time to help others .
