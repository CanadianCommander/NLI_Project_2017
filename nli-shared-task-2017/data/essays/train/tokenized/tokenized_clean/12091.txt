some poople in japan , where i live , disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .however , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities for the following reasons .first , school often says that young people have to spent their time studing .for example , my son studies at shudo highschool , a private achool in hiroshima where locates western part of japan .he wants to communicate wiht our neighborhood .but , he always have many assignments and can not attend a community meetig .in japan , exam scores are most important so young people have to study hard to get high score .in consequent , young people have no time to helping their communities .second , there are few communities in our neighborhood so if young people want , they can not spend thier time helping their communitiew .for example , when i was a junior highschool student there were many communities around us and spent much time to helping our communities .now , in japan , people often do not know who lives in thier neighborhood .we do not know each other so there are few communities around us .because there are few communities , young people do not give enogh time to helping their communities .if there were many communities , young people would give enogh time to helping their communities .terefore , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
