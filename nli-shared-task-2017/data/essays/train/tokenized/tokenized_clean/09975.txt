it is better to specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowlege of academic subject .first of all , human brain is limited there are cuntless of books and knowlege in the world that human being has achieved .it s surely impossible that one individual has all that knowlege .beside if we want to broaden our knowlege the depth of it would be shallow .however , if we specialize in one subgect , still it woul be a lot to do , it woul be much easier than to have broad knowlege , and we can deepen it by study and all kinds of efforts .second , thereare lot s of college graduators in the world .however if they have same level of knowlege. , it would be not helpful for each other .in society , we ca nt live with other s help .we need doctor s in hosptal , but also nurses and pharmasist .it is efficient and easier to divide the work than one person does the all the jobs .third , we need to relay our accomplishment to our next generations like our former generation did .if our ancestors have nt acheive anything , there would be no civilization and industralizaion of present time .the world is developing by the people who study in specific subject .we call them specialist .without specialists the world is not going to be develonped any
