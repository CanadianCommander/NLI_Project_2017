i think that i will have to partially agree and partially disagree with the statement that young people tend to not give enough time helping their communities .to answer the question accuratley though , and to fully explain my personal opinion on the topic , first of all we need to define the word ` community  .a community is not only the place where you are living .it might just as well be a certain group of people you spend a lot of time with , like your sports team , your school , political parties , your church or a local band .all these are communities .sure there are young people who just like to hang out with their friends at home , watching television or playing videogames .but teenagers are starting to wake up again , they have begun to be more active and participate in group activities , in communities .there are festivals and street markets organized by teenagers , they sing in their churches or help raising funds for charity projects .it is the young people - and not big companies or mighty politicians - who are struggling for a job and a future and therefore go through a lot of effort like organizing conferences or meetings with those in charge to change something about the situation .clearly they can not do all this on their own and need help from adults like parents , teachers , mayors and company bosses .but young people are up on their feet again , they are trying to make a change for the better .of course it is very easy to get the impression that in our society everyone only thinks of his - or herself anymore and is not willing to volunteer for a higher purpose , especially when you think of teenagers .however , this impression can only be right if you look at individuals .many young people are only concerned with their own future and their own well-being , excatly like many adults do .but there are just as many great teenagers i know that spend a lot of time helping their communities and the people surrounding them .
