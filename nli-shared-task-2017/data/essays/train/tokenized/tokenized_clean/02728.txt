innovation , risks and success in sciencethe factors which makes a random academician a distinguished scientist , or an ordinary cook a chief of reputation lie in the same place : innovation .to introduce new ideas , or even combining the existent ones in a different way changes the course of the lives , countries and eventually the history yet to be written .however , it takes its tolls under the threats of risks .against all odds and all the risks , the innovation is still the key to the success in every profession .here is the journey of the same person proving that how innovation and risk taking can alter the course of history .and in lack of these two factors how a sucessful person can spend years without reaching to a solution .albert einstein was a curious mind striving to explain the connectivity between the forces governing the universe .he changed the paradigm of the physics from old newtonian perspective introducing the relativity .this was also meaning the risk of unacceptance and scornful comments from the peers in physics .after all , he was just an officer in a patent office studying physics in an unscholarly way .in fact , his early papers are rejected by the journals .however , he has been eventually proved to be true by the observations claiming him to be sucessful .ironically , in the second part of his professional life when the quantum theorists followed his way to form the next paradigm known as quantum mechanics , he would be the person to build the barriers against the new ideas .he would say ` god does not play dice ...  not accepting the probabilty factor in physics .he spent his last years working on the same problem the way he did for the relativity , having no answers .the old way of thinking deterministically and adding the beauty of mathematics were not working anymore .problem needed a new approach from which einstein preffered to stay away .nobody can guess what would happen if he tried to colloborate with the new paradigm and search for new ideas .taking the risk of finding that the universe depends on a probability game was not bearable and einstein stayed in his track with no other sucess .the same great mind with two different attitudes bring two different consequences : a ground breaking theory and a solitary research era , giving a good example how innovative and courageous the scientists should be if they are to be successful .
