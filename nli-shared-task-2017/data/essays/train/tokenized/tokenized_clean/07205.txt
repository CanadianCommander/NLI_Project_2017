in any kind of educative , teaching , or learning institution , there are many ways in which classes ( specifically academic ) are imparted .many teachers like their students to understand the ideas and concepts they are learning , and other teachers like them to learn about the same things by teaching facts about it .according to both of this ideas of learning , is it better to undersand ideas and concepts of certain topic ?or is it better to learn the facts about the same topic ?i think that it is very important to learn facts about any topic you want to learn about .learning facts is something that will help you in the future because they are very useful .for example , learning the facts about certain roman leader who lost the empire will help you in the future , if you are a leader of any kind of institution , to avoid commiting the same mistakes as he did .another important thing about facts is that they can never be changed and that most of them are important to know about in order to understand people who are `` experts  in the career you are applying to .in that way , you would understand what they re talking about if they mention any of these facts .finally , facts are important because they full-fill your general knowledge on many aspects ( as they say : knowledge is power ) .in my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts about any topic is something very important in life .understanding ideas and concepts about anything will help you to apply these same ideas and topics in the future and make things right , thus becoming a practical person .when you understand a concept or an idea , you do nt need to learn anymore about it because then you can use it or apply in any way you want , especially in a job or a career .when you understand a concept , you can even explain it in many ways or in your own words ( it s better than memorizing things ) .if you understand an idea , then you can apply the knowledge you have about it and turn it into something practical .for example , if you study to be a mechanical engineer , and you understand the whole concept of car motors , then you can be able to use this concept to fix motors , or to explain or teach others about motors in a simpler way than how you learned it , so that they can apply the concept in a practical way .in this example , if you keep doing this or applying your concepts on motors , you can even become the owner of an important car company or an important workshop .after these explanations and showing my reasoning , i think i agree with the statement that says `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .this probably sounds too rude , buy i really think it is better to be a practical person than just being a `` smartass  , and you can achieve this by understanding ideas and concepts as a student to apply them afterwards in real life .and who knows , maybe if you do this , in the future these ideas or concepts may help in your career or in any day life event .this is why i completely agree with the statement expressed before .
