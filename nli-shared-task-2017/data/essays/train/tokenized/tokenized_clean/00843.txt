helping in communitieshelping in communities is very important four young people because it makes them more reponsible .it also can help them to find their sense in life and to feel useful .on the other hand , i agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to help their communities .they have not enough time to do so , they do not identify with their communities and the work is not sait to be fun .firstly , there is very much pressure put on young people to be sucessful in school .in our society , it is often more appreciated to have good marks than to help other people .mostly , colleges do not care about the privat and social life of students but about their marks in school .therefore , it seem to be more important to students to work for school than to help other people .due to this , there is not much time left to spend on helping other people .secondly , young people often do not have a very close relationship to their communities .on reason for this is that people change the towns thez are living in quite often .for example , if parents find an other jod in an other town , they will take thier children with them and the whole familiy will move away .if this happens often , the children can not devellop a close relationship to their communities .for this reason young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .thirdly , young people want to have fun in their free-time .if you ask a young boy whether he preferes spending his time playing football or to go out with frinds or to help an old woman , he will surely answer that he likes to play rather than to help .we live in a sociaty that supplies having fun .i believe that this is an other reason why young people do not give enough time to help their communities .due to these reasons , i believe that young people do not spend enough time on helping in their communities .i hope that this fact will change in future .
