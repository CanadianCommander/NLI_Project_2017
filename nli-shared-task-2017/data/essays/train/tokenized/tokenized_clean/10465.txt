nowadays it is often mentioned that we are using up our natural resources and that there will be very few resources of fuel in a few decades .as the usable amount fuel will be getting less the the cost will get higher .even today for a few years gas and fuel prices have gone very high .as a result of these it is claimed by some of the researchers that there will be fewer cars in twenty years time .though i do not agree with this idea , i even think that there will be more cars in twenty years .there are two reasons that i strongly claim .first reason of the fact that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the alternative energy sources .as engineers we predict that alternative energy sources will be in use in ten years time like sun and hydrogen energy .there are really important researches on the use of these energies for cars .even in turkey there are more than 40 cars using sun energy built so far .moreover cars using hydrogen energy has already been built but still being worked on .when we come over this energy problem , in other words make the last car products working with alternative energy there will certainly be an increse in the number cars in use .the second reason is that in twenty years there will still be plenty of petrol that can be used ( may be more expensive ) .and if we consider the populaion growth and the increase of wealth we can conclude that in twenty years there will more people using cars , even one family will have four or five cars !as a result the claim that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is completely wrong from the point of view that i have here .as an engineer i can say that cars in use will increase day by day
