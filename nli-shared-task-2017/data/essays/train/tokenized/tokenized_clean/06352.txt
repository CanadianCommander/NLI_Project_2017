if i was asked `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years  , i would answer i do nt think so .there are two reasons in my opinions .first , some people use cars , while others use trains and buses , but both transportations are very busy in the morning .so seeing from nowadays situations , to dicrease using cars will lead to a serious problem .for example , we ca nt get on the train which we want to get on because of busy and full , we are late to be the going place because of train s late running .therefore i do nt think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years since if there are fewer cars in use , public transportation ca nt work .second , since many people love to drive a car including me , i m sure that cars in use will not dicrease .moreover such as people do nt like useing busy trains .they prefer driving a car to using another transportations .lastly , cars companies sill develop car s model , cost and now they tried to make new kinds of cars like economy car .so i beilieve cars in use are increasing .
