a lot of controversy exists over weather traveling with a group or by alone .however , i strongly believe that traveling in a group led by tour guide is more valuable than traveling without a group .when i trip with group , it can be benificial .also , i can make good relationship with my members of the group .the first reason why i would like to trip with large group is that traveling can be extremly helful for me .i get information about new places i wanted to know from the tour guide and share knowledge with my group members .this creats more beneficial traveling for everyone .for example , i visited the states last year with a group led by a tour guide .i did not have information about the place which i viewed , but the tour guide explained very carefully and friendly so that i could understanding the place s history and charactoristics .in addition , traveling with a group makes me socialize with people .when some people are in trouble during the trip , such as ill or losing money , other people can cooperate each other so that they can solve their problem easily .also , i can learn to control myself .group activities need to each person s responsibility and ability of self control .when i do well in the group , i will be able to learn a sense of accomplishment .it is often said that traveling in a group with a tour guide has some of nagative points .however , if i have a chance to trip , i will choose traveling with a goup of people for my enjoyable trip .it can be beneficial and it offers people to socialize with others .all we should notice that when people are traveling or exploring new places , having a tour guide and a group of people are positive influeces for their trip .
