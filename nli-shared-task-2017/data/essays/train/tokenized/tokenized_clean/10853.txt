i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .instead , i feel its the other way round .its the old peole who have an opportunity to enjoy their lives rather than the young ones .there are various reasons which justify my position .first , a young guy would always have a lot to think .he would be worried about his career .he knows its a crucial time for him which shall shape his future .he spends most of his time planning and thinking .a lot of his effort goes into this .since , an old person would be through with this phase of his life , he will not have any tensions related to career as such .he has achieved what he wanted to and could now enjoy his success .secondly , when a person is young he s knows that he has to take care of his family .he knows he is the bread earner .this fact of life does nt allow him to savor his youth .he spends his time working in offices or runninng businesses to cater to his familiy s needs .on the other hand older people donot have to work .they have retired and free to enjoy their lives .third , a young person is still learning to survive in the world .he does nt have all the wisdom and exerience to deal with the difficult situations which an older person would have .from childhood to youth , he learns how to adjust , deal with relationships and handle pressures .for the young , the life is full of hardships and he s learing to find his way through .forth , its a time when a person gets married .it s said , a right marriage can make you and a wrong one can destroy .the person need to develop that level of maturity and understanding to deal with his spouse .he does compromises , making it a not so easy life for him .on the other hand , having lived so many years together , older people have developed that understanding .this leaves them with a good partner to enjoy their lives with .undoubtely , according to me , when a person is young he s building a platform for his older life .a platform on which when he grows old , he can live and relish life and can enjoy things which he missed when he was young .
