to be successful you have to take risks and experiment new things !i definitely support this vision of life and there are many reasons why i believe so .first of all we should learn from history and from our recent past that many successful people tried innovative things , instead of continuing doing the usual , and their creativity and courage to take risks has been prized .for example , in many fields of art , from cinema to graphic design , from theater to painting , people who took risks to create and promote forms of art that were different and new and maybe even ` risky  for the big public , are now on art history books and are considered as masters of contemporary art !a second reason why i strongly think that innovative things are a fundamental basis for success is that things that represent ` the norm  or ` the usual  have their own market and this market is very unlikely to increase when it has reached a very established and balanced steady state .but innovative things can open new markets from nothing !think about the fast food industry in italy in the 80s !before the 80s italians were not used to fast food , the way it was intended in the united states .the first business man who decided to open the first hamburger fast food had to fight against the usual habit of italian people to eat a simple `` panino  [ sandwich in italian ] or pizza .sure the decision was risky , but 25 years down the line we have a mcdonald s or a burger king in any city centre . ..even adjecent to very important and beautiful historical buildings .maybe our landscapes have not benefited from it , but the owner of these chains had a great deal with his innovative entreprenourial attitude .it can certainly be argued that for every positive and succesfull experience there are many others that do nt reach the same goal of notoriety or economical success and risk is always a matter of chance !nevertheless it is certainly true that , by not taking the risk of trying new things , success is very hard to obtain if one keeps doing the same and does not differentiate himself or herself from the rest of the people .
