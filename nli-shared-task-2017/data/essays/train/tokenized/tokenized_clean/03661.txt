as we know , young people are more energetic , enthusiastic , and enjoy better health , then it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?personally speaking , i do not agree with such a contention .first , the lives of young people are much more streassful than that of older people .the generations of our parents or grandparents were born in the 1930s to 1950s , when the population in china was relatively small .by contrast , most young people nowadays were born during the birth boost in 1980s , therefore , the competition for education opportunity and job positions are much more fierce for them .they have to work day and night to support themselves financially .second , young people are in a specific phase of their lives when there are more troubles and frustrations than older people .for example , young people would feel overwhelmed with anxiety or stress when first falling in love , when getting married , when expecting a baby , all of which are new to them , so that they are not sure whether they can handle .however , the life for older people is more peaceful and smooth , without such anxieties .what s more , young people might probably have some financial problems , especially when they are frustrated in job hunting .by contrast , most older people have pension and they are covered by social welfare system , such as medcare , so that they are emaciated from such financial troubles and are living a more secured and decent life .third , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , however , young people tend to be neglected in some way .nowadays , young people are encouraged or even forced to move out of their parents  houses and begin an independent life by themselves .sometimes they are living in detachness , loneless and isolation .by contrast , older people are respected by the whole soceity , and they are refrently visited by his children as well as social workers .in numerous family get-togethers , it is not hard to tell how happy they are , with a pride of self-accomplishment .in sum , although we must admit that young people are more health , energetic and enthusiastic than older people , at the same time , they are facing more stress , competition and anxiety .what s more , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , but young people are negelected in some way .thus , i do not think young people are living a better life than older people .
