in my opinion , apart from some specfic cases of people who are ` self taughed  , we always need to use the experience of our ancestors .it is completly insane to set a frontier between past and present .success in whatever field is built on past experiences .for instance , in biology , current scientists are leading research programs using the conclusions of former scientists .alexander fleming discovered pennicilline in the 1920s and medical progress could not be as advanced as it is today if he had not .nevertheless , admittedly , if you do not take risks , you are not likely to make progress .indeed , if investors had not trusted scientists to fund their researches , there would not have been such an advanced science .investors can be states , private companies , etc .they take risks because when they invest their money in medical reserach for intance , they are not sure that this research program will be successful tomorrow .if the program fails , they can lose all the money they invest in such a program to the detriment to other potential successful programs .the solution would be to match both the opinions .most of successful people try new things and use what they know from former experiences at the same time .indeed , people must call themselves into question before taking risks and they must try new things to survive .tht is why human being are so different from animals .this is what we call human intelligence .not to take dangerbasically , i think both parts of the statement are true but we must bind rhem together not oppose them .indeed , in order to go further in the analysis , it is impossible to take risks whithout using what we know and , on the contrary , you can not make progress without taking risks .
