in the course of they studies , people are often confronted to a dilemma : should they focus on a single subject or study a broad variety of topics ?let me examine arguments in supports of the two options , and finally i ll explain why an intermediate answer is needed .in the harsh competion of modern world , finding a job often requires a high level of knowledges and performance , which can be achieved only by focusing on a speciality .i also personnally ca nt help covering a subject in its totallity whwn i have begun to study it , else i fell frustated i had better not to start !however , although being highly specialized and knowing little aside can ensure you a good job and intellectuall fullfillment , it can be very disturbing in your social life .imagine you meet someone specialized in engineering while you are spezialized in music , there can be no conversation between both of you !the range of people you are likely to meet anf appreciate would be very short . ..and even regarding jobs , let s think a bit further : to the extend a company uses to develop its products various fields , its technitians must know enough about the others speciality in order to work together .for example , if a telescope manufacturer s opticians are unable to communicate with the mechanists to share their needs and constraints , the company will never be able to manufacture any instrument .that s why i think we ca nt really give a sharp answer to the question .we need to be specialized for certain things as job and academic career , but an enjoyable everyday life requires that everybody knows a little about everything .in can be extremely important , have a look for example at the nuclear debate : here are some decisions to be taken that ca nt be left to specialists only , as every person is higly concerned .there are several ways between the two extrem positions , and people sould be allowed to choose the specialization grade that suits them .
