i agree the idea that it is more significant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .first of all , many of the students would prefer the easier and quicker way of understanding .understanding ideas and concepts is easier for a student to manage the information .if a student learns a new thing , she or he would first ask the ideas and concepts of the thing to realize the conditions of the new information .this way always seems more practical to the students .i also would prefer this way , since understanding the main idea by explaining both ideas and concepts would make me understand more easily .facts are longer and harder way for most students .since learning a fact contains many details in itself , it would be more complex for a student .learning facts also takes longer period than it does in understanding ideas and concepts .this is mainly because of its complexity .if i would be introduced to a new topic , and given the specific information by learning facts , it would take me longer and harder to learn that topic .because i have to analyze the fact first and then the related things that effect the fact .however , to understand ideas and concepts would supply me in realizing the new topic by giving specific information by ideas and concepts .
