yes , i agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .how a person is successful ?or you can ask why a person is successful ?the answer to this question is that ` it is all about the innovation  , i.e. innovative mind .if you try doing new things , innovative things , definitely one will succeed in the area in which he is trying new things .its not thet you are not successfull in one field than only you can try another field .people who are successful in one field , also try to be in another field and try to succeed in that , those people are successful people .their mind think differently , think innovative and unique things .also if a person is doing a similar thing for longer period of time , he will get bored of it .so one should try doing different things not for the sake of success only but for their own knowledge also .successful people never stick to one thing which they know how to do well but they always try doing different things .there are many examples of people who are very innovative .they are successful in one field but then also they try doing different things in which they are new .and if hard work is done with dedication , nothing is impossible .there are many people who are very successful in their cinema career , sports etc but they tried politics also , and guess what , they are successful in that field also .that people were also new to politics , but they tried to manage both the fields simultaneously .so what i think that a person should always try different things and never stick to just one thing in life , not for success only but also for a change in life .
