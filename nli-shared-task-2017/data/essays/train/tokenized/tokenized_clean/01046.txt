enjoying life and profiting of life are very important .enjoying life for me does nt depend on a specific age but it depends on willing , circumstances , money , health and a lot of other things .if we take the point of willing or looking forward to enjoy life , we will get variable situations and variable results .for example there are young people who are full of freshness but they don  have the willing of enjoying life and i am one of those .iam 28-years-old , i am thinking all the time about problems especially my problems and my ambition without paying attention that i am losing a lot of time in stress and calculations with no results and in the same time i am not enjoying at all my life .in the same time i am astonished from my grand father who is 82-years-old and he is enjoying every single moment of his life .sometimes , the circumstances of the life does nt allow us to profit from life .for example i know some people who can not enjoy their lives due to a unique reason which is : ( work ) , the word seems so simple and we can ask ourselves how can work can block like this the sense of enjoying life ?it s so simple when you work between 9 and 12 hours per day you ca nt really enjoy because you do not have time and your brain became formated only to work .i think that there are a lot of young healthy people who can not enjoy their life due to their work .in the same time there are other young and old people who have the priority of enjoying life without thinking in work .other points that can influence our sense of enjoying life is money .some people , enjoying life for them is depending essentially on money , because for them they can not enjoy without travelling , without buying luxurious cars and houses and this part of people is including young and old people so it does nt depend on age .the last and the most important point for me is : health .a person who is sick or with bad health conditions , can not have a good quality of life and as a rsult of this he can not enjoy life even if he has the willing and money .on the contrary of a person in a good health can enjoy his life easily with little bit of money and willing .to summarize-up for me enjoying life does nt have an age but we can say it has a soal .
