some may argue that successful people do nt try new things meaning that they do nt take any risks in the life .however , i disagree with this opinion and for some reasons i beleive that one should take risks in order to be successful in the life .first of all , trying new things develops one s imagination and creativity .in other words doing the things which we already know brings ordinarity and make people s life monoton .i think , imagination and creativity plays very important role in being successful .only if you have some extraordinary imagination and creativity you can succeed .i wolud like to qoute from albert einstein saying `` imagination is more important than knowledge , knowledge is limited but imagination encirles the world .on the other hand , the life itself , i beleive , is a risk .no one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring .so , if we are living in a risky life , then , it is unnecessary to hesitiate to take some risks in the life .by taking risks , people increases their chances of finding new opportunies to make their lifes more enjoyable , confortable and desirable .i think , most of the successful people taking risks beacuse of the invevitability of risks .thirdly , no one can know what something new will bring without trying it .i mean , of course , while something new will have both negative and positive effects , not to trying it restricts the probability of getting the positive side .i beleive that making some preliminary studies , i mean thinking , one can easily take risks in the sake of getting the positive sides .for these reasons i stated above , i am of the opinon that successful people try new things and take risks in the life .
