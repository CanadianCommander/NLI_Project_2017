the marketing have devoloped very fast , the companies every day are discussing what they have to do to sale more and how they can attract more consumers .the advertisement is a good technice to obtain their goals .the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are  is a true .the advertisements make the people believie that the products are as they show in the television or in the magazines .i have lived this expirience with a shampoo .i have a very curly hair so i need a shampoo that do nt lets me see as a lion .when i watch in the television the advertisement of pantenne s shampo that lets your hair very curly but not as a lion i thought it was the best solution to my hair , so i went to buy it inmediately .the first time i used it was a dissaster , it did nt works as they show in the advertisement and also my hair began to fall .in that moment i undestood that you can not believe in the advertisments .other example to support my opinion is when i went to isla margarita in venezuela .i chose the hotel that i saw in the web page , it seems very comfortable and beautiful , but when i arrived to the hotel , i was very dissapointed because it was nt what i was expecting .the room was very small , the air conditioning was damaged and the food wasn ; t good .the same day arrived i changed to another hotel , which was spectacular .the advertisments make believe the consumers what they not really are .the companies are trying to attract consumers by showing them false attributes of the products and by this way the companies will have to replant their advertisments , because it would cause damage in their image and the people will not buy again their products .
