if you read the statement for the first time , you probably would agree at once , but after some thinking i disagree with that statement .though reasons like `` young people are in good shape to do everything they want  or `` young people do nt know any sorrows  come to one s mind immediately i do nt think these are the deciding facts concerning this question .moreover , i would say that older people have the great advantage to know real friends or even to have partner or a own family with whom they can share their luck .when you are young , people come and go , but older people know better with whom they want to share their whole life .furthermore , older people found out their real passions and can spend their time on them .as a child you maybe try to do a lot of different things , like playing soccer or tennis , but you do often quit them after a while , because you are not satisfied .in opposite to the older generation , who got to know themselves better over the years and therefore can fill their spear-time with activities they really enjoy .above all , older people are more experienced than the younger are .this is the deciding reason why i disagree with the quotation .there are many beautiful things happening in the world that you do nt see as a young man or wowan , because you are busy with yourself or occupied with non-important issues .a beautiful landscape , for example , means a lot to older people but younger people maybe do nt even take notice of that .everyone can see another example when you look into an ordinary parc in a city .in general there are more older people hanging around and i think that fact shows that they know better how to fill their life with joy and fun .the conclussion of that essay must nt be scary to anyone .in the end it says that we are all winners .the older generation , because they are probably enjoying the best time of their life but also the younger generation , because they can look forward to it .
