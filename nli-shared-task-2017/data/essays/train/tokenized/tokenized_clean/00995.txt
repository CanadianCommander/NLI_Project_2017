it is hard to identy the one way in this dillema having broad knowledge about many academic subjects than to specializa in one specific subject .according to me , to spealize in one specific subject provide so much detail in one subject , creates experts in specific subjects and increase concentration on the issue , make team spretual , so the new achievements can be achieved easily .first of all to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the one skip the details .therefore they can never have deep knowledge about the one main subject .on the other hand , in the one will speliaze in one subject to do not skip the details , since it has so many time to focus on the subject .secondly , if the one try to know everything , acn not be expert of one subject .if the specific subject is specialized than , and make deep investigation about the area s/he will be known as the expert on the issue .then after , i can call specialized as experts in addition to those if the one has broad knowlege of everything , s/he would not except the team work , since s/he can see himself as the one knows everything .fourtunately , the expert would want to get the others aspects about the project and can create the effective team work and brain storming in order to achieve the result of his or her project .that means getting information from other specialists .at last the expert can achive the result of the projects more easliy , since s/he would only concentrate what they should do .if the help is needed than they can get help from other experts .therefore it would maximaze the efficeny of knowledge .as a result , being expert , ehich means having specialized knowlege on specific subject creates team spretual with other expert easily , increase concentration and creates focun on the target and at last creates big achivement , so we need expert in order to courage big achievements .
