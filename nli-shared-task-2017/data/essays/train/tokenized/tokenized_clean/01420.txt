when it comes to the topic of tour , there are many perspectives about the best way to have a enjoyable travel .some people may hold the view that it is travel in a group led by a tour guide that provides the best method .however , as far as i am concerned , travel with friends or other acqaintences without a tour guied is a more rational chioce .obviously the fundamental element to decide which way to take a travel is what you want to acquire from the travel .do you choose to travel for the scenery , relax or business ?the reponse is different from person to person .however , the most possible case if for both scenery and relax .so the tour guide accompanying the travel group might give rise to some negative effect from that degree .why ?considering you are traveling with your best friends to paris , one of the most romantic cities in the world , it s normal even irresitible to feel uncomfortable because there is a strange man of woman who is keeps saying besides you for the salary he or she would get from that trip .taking this point into consideration , i often choose to travel with my intimate friends or relatives without a tour guide for more natural and comfortable atmosphere which contributes to the enjoyment of my travel indeed .furthermore , it is so commen that many people who had chosen to let a tour guide arrange the travel felt very regretful for that decision .there are many cases which are given by my friends who felt angry about the tour guides .some of them complained that the tour guide were ethusiastic about leading them to expensive and extravagent stores rather than illustrating the history and scene of the scenic place .others felt disappointed because the tour guide arranged the travel in a tight schedul which made them feel so exhausted after the trip .such types of complains are numerous which demonstrate the flaws and drawbacks of travel led by a tour guide .so if we take a careful consideration of that issue , it s not difficult to make the conclusion that the best way to travel is without a tour guide rather than with a tour guide .
