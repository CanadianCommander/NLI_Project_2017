regarding to the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones , i hold the view this is true .regarding to my opinion young people today have a lot more possibilities to create their life .first they have the opportunity to go long to school and afterwards studying whatever they want to .older people never had this great opportunity , nor the money for such a comfortable life .second is the creation of the wide range of spare time activities .there are so many new possibilities what one can do in leisure time , which have not existed in the time when the older people were young , and what they now can not do any longer because of health problems .the variety goes from sports , culture , travelling to visiting friends in a foreign country .from this i want to move to the next point : foreign studies .younger people do nt even have the great oppotunity to study , but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice .this is an important extraordinary experience , which has a great impact on the later life .living in a country for a period of time is something else than beeing on vacation .the young have the opportunity to learn really from other cultures ans so probably develop a different view about many things in early years of their life .older ones can do this after years of work and ca nt take the chances in that way .but one has also take into account the carreer chances offered to the young people .with the money from the parents it is possible to live in a big city whre many great companies are .so they have a greater chance to move from home to another city and live independent .to conclude , one can say there are various things what make the life for young people easier and more comfortable than in the past and even in the future for the older people of our society .
