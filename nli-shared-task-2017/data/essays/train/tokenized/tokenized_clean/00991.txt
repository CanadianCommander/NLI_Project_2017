although young people tend to have more energy to do something than older people do , i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people .there are two reasons for this : money and experiences .to bigin with , the old people usually have more money than young people have .this means older have more opptions to do something than younger .for instance , when we want to travel somewhere , the panphlets of travel for senior tend to be costly than those for family or young people .this is becouse , the older have tendency to eat better dishes or ride on more comfortable vheicles .however , in general , young people focus on the cost .we can also this tendency in panphlets of travel .this shows that the older can more flexible how to spend their money and how to select their plans .next , older people have more expereinces than younger people which are based on the long life time .therefore , older people have less possibility to make wrong dicision .for example , when we ca nt decide which way to choose about something , we are often consulted by older .this is because , if we decide wrong way , sometimes we recieve inconvenience .this means that older poeple can avoid such inconvenience by their own judgement .for these reasons , i take issue with the idea that young people lead more enjoyable life than old people .each group of people can enjoy their life as their own way .
