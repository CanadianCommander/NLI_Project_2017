i think the knowledge of a lot pf subjects forms the culture of each people .a person with a certain culture who is involved in a discussion , is able to speak with others of several issues .this means to avoid ignorance , and with this fact many purposes can be achieved .someone who has a knowledge of many subjects can speak of everything , not feeling submitted to anyone because of lack of informations , or because he doesn  t know what to say .this means people to feel more secure of themselves .it is interesting to enlarge the knowledge of a subject more and more , but it isn  t always possible because of time and costs .so a person who is specialized only in a particular subject can speak only about that , feeling ignorant about the rest .it is also interesting to improve the knowledge of several subjects in order to form our personality and to find always other things to disvcover .if you only know a specific subject you don  t know very much what surrounds you .with the knowledge of only one subject , you know a little , if you know less specifically many subjects , you know a lot .it is interesting to underline that a wide culture , the knowledge of many subjects , also gives people a sort of common sense , gives the faculty to understand properly what happens around them , something like consciousness .in fact the most advanced countries have a school system that goes through the knowledge of a lot of subjects , and only after that they have something improving the skill that regards each person future work .first of all you have to give the basis , then you can build something specific on them .if there  s a lack of basis , there won  t be anything else .
