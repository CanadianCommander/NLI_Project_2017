studying can be a great pain for many students , and it is true that many doubt the purpose of learning throughout the course .i believe learining is an important process in which i can incorporate more information and enrich myself , therefore i believe studying in general is important .however , i believe understanding the basic ideas has to come before learning facts , which is usually more simple and interesting .for instance , i have know many friends who do not have strong base for the mathematic : they have difficulties in solving basic calculation such as multiplication with fractions .also , when a student has difficulty in understanding , it is likely to cause her to lose interest in study .thus , lack of the basic knowledge may lead students to lose the will to study .when those who lack the basic knowledge learn facts , those facts may not seem so appealing because they are not familiar .however , learning facts can be more entertaining .and moreover , i believe its effect is the most apparent in the study of history .for example , i strongly believe that i would not be so interested in studying history , or world war ii in particular , if it was not for the background knowledge i have gained throughout the life .because i have seen a documentary about anne frank and holocaust , the information provided in the classroom seem a lot more interesting and familiar , giving me a will to learn more about the subject .although some people may not realize the great importance of the presence of interests , i believe students should persue strong base for each subjects through understanding the ideas step by step .i believe interests are greatest factor which would bring changes to the students  attitudes , and more importantly , their will to study .and i do enjoy knowing and persuing trivias .however , as a student and for my ability to study pleasantly , i believe it is more important to have a great understanding in the genral ideas rather than learning facts by bits , for collection of the facts is less likely to make sense .but i would like to stress that understanding of general ideas and learning facts can be interdependent for enjoyable study .
