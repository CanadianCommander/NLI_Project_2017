through an academic training , you usually get broad knowledge of various topic .but you can also decide to specialize on a subject that you may be keen on studying .to my mind , i think it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have a specialization .you can have an overview of many topics and have a generalist training .also , you do nt get bored by such a diversity of subjects .firstly , having broad knowledge gives the opportunity to learn things about an unkown subject .for example , i studied for one year in grenoble ecole de management .this first year was very generalist and i could learn the basic principles of many subjects .i studied accounting , finances , marketing .i reckon that a futur manager must have a knowledge on each of these subjects and master them .it  a condition if he wants to succeed .thus , i believe having broad knowledge is an opportunity to learn more things .above all this diversified knowledge will be useful in the future life .secondly , i think that if you study only one specific subject , you can get bored and became fed up with it .indeed , having a specialization means studying the same subject for long hours in the same day or week .even if it can be a subject you find really attractive and interesting , the fact to focus on it can have negative effects .the interest can decrease so as the attention paid to the subject .after long hours spended on the same issue , you enjoy tackling another subject and consequently another interest arises .thus , in my opinion i think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial .it allows to have a generalist training and to get the basic principles on subjects , useful for daily life .moreover , with such a diversity you are more involved in each subjects and do nt get bored with the training .
