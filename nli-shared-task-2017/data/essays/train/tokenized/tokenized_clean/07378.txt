nowadays it is considered as a very popular topic that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one topic .many people ignores this topic but it is very important for the university students and ones who have an aim to have an academic career .opponents of the idea ` having one specific subject  consider that one should have relative subjects like maths and physics , so when they see an integral in the middle of a physics lesson , they should avoid the problems with ease .moreover they think that one can earn much money when s/he has two or more subjects .in addition to that it will ease the communication between student and teacher , when they have many things to talk about .although in first sight it is seen that one should have many academic subjects , it is not like it is seen .first of all one should know a lot of things about maths if she/he is a physician .so s/he does nt have to make longer his/her study and be also an mathematician .it will bore the teacher when s/he is young and a university student and s/he can change his/her plan being an academician .in addition to that it is always considered that one can earn a lot of money when s/he has two or more subjects .the answer is simple : no !the academicians are paid by the hours that they teach .no one pay you much money even if you have ten subjects or one .the payment is always the same .thirdly physicians do nt have to know much about psychology .because thay have no time to spend with another subject for just finding a topic with students to talk about .if they want to talk about something they can talk about football matches , tv programs etc . .at last we should consider that academicians are busy people and they are being waited for the researches and new technologies .the second subject will reduce the chance of discover the new part of the modern life because thay wo nt have time and energy to focus on the new researches .if everyone could do just his/her own job , the world would have been probably different and lovely . .
