in my opinion , history shows that people that take risks and try new things are more successful that those that prefer to rely on their existing knowledge .there are several reasons and examples that support my point of view .first , in our globalized world , knowledge and technological innovations are rapidly increasing .ten years ago , nobody used the internet .today it is almost impossible to be successful without knowing how to write an email and how to surf in the internet .therefore , it is necessary to be open to new inventions and changes in societies in order to make progress .moreover , inventions have normally been made because people started to try new things and to take risks .a musician that only plays the songs he already manages quite well is nt very likely to invent a new song or to improve his interpretation .only by trying out alternative interpretations , even though it may sound odd in the first place , new ideas may come to the musician s mind .consequently , his interpretation of the song can be improved .therefore , by taking the risk of leaving behind old patterns of thinking , previously unknown concepts can be found out .in addition , people that take the risk of starting a business with a new concept may have more success than those that sell established products .although franchising , for example , gives the shopowner more security , the possibilty of making huge surpluses is lower .enterly new and creative concepts , however , can help you to become really successful .in conclusion , taking risks and trying new things contributes to make people successful .due to globalization , society changes rapidly , so that you are required to broaden your horizon in order to succeed .furthermore , the possibilities of making a new discory and to run a successful business are higher .thus , i prefer to do new things and to take risks .
