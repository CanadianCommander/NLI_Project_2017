christopher columbus was the first european to discover the continent america .he was an explorer .i thinkt it is quite evident to everybody that in order to reach his aims he had to take a lot of risks and finally , although america is not india , he succeeded .but is it always necessary to take risks in order to be a successful person .with regard to this question the first thing to come into my mind is that there are actually a lot of people who are highly successful without ever taking much risk in their lifes .i am talking about people who have a pleasant childhood , who have nice parents that are aware of their responsibilty of being parents .parents who care about the education of their children .mostly those children have fewer problems at school which means they have better marks and therefore are allowed to study on well-reputated universities and finally become for example high-paid businessmen .they never take much risk and still become successful .moreover i am not sure if it would not be better to focus on your strengths .michael porter for instance affirmed , that companies should rather focus on their competencies instead of trying to enhance their weaknesses .in my view that is applicable for human-beings .you probably could be much more successful if you try to enhance your already existing skills than to start to learn new skills , and of course that is less risky .but on the other hand there is no denying the fact that there are numerous examples , like kolumbus , which proof that a certain amount of risk is a premise for success .that for example can easily on the stock market .the stocks that yield the highest profit are also those which can cost you a lot of money - they are highly risky .and of course the exmaple of the businessmen is only some kind of a stereotype .often one has to make difficult decisions in order to reach one | s aims in the working life .decisions always equals potential risk .suppose you get a challenging high-paid job offer in asia .then you could jump on it taking the risk of going into a new country and being exposed to strange and maybe unkind people or you could deny it and stay in your homecountry earning an average amount of money leading a normal life .taking all the relevant aspects into consideration i reach the conclusion that it is always a trade-off .you can either be successful taking no risks an relying on your old skills or you can be successful taking a lot of risk by going a new and different way .therefore i can not totally agree with this statement .
