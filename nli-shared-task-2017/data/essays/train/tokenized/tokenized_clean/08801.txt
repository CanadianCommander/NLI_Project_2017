are not sleeping well these days .they say that it is becoming a harsher world .the development of technology resulted in isolation between families and neighboors .the younger generation is especially thought of as self-centered and unhelpful to their communities .some facts might be true , but i disagree with the statement that the younger generation is unhelpful because young people spend a lot of time contributing to their communities by direct and indirect ways .the first reason i disagree with the statement is that young people actually do spend a lot of time helping out with the community .for example , in my college , every freshman s dream is to join a student operated club to make school life more enjoying and plentiful .there are various choices of clubs , ranging from drama clubs to tea drinking clubs .however , out of the approximitly 100 clubs , one third of the clubs are volunteering clubs .also , our school has a course that gives credit for volunteering during the semester .eventhough the course is worth 1 credit , it is impossible to take the course because so many students apply for it .it may seem like young people are only interested in themselves , but given these reasons , i unquestionably believe that young people spend a considerate amount of time helping the community .moreover , i disagree with the statement because the younger generation contribute to their communities not only directly , but in indirectly as well .unlike the older generation , the younger people are exposed to advanced technology and globalization .in their own way their own way .for example , my country , korea , is a small country .recently , however , korea has been expanding quickly into the world .the reason is that young , smart people made succeses all over the world .because the represent our country , our country has a more succesful status in the world .the younger generation may be a little more self-minded than the older people .however , that does not mean that they do not help their society .we are all contridbuting to our communities the way we can in our own unique ways .that is why our world is still a beautiful place to live .
