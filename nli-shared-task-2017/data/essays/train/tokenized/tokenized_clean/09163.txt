i do think nowdays , most of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .when we are watching t.v , we could see this a lot of amazing and creative advertisements very often some of them make it too fakely so people do not belive it but it stil has this werid attractive that make people to try he product or services that they advertise .however i agree with this topic but i think it could lead to very good and effective advertisements which will be very attractive to customers .there is a lot of competive between all those products or services nowday therefore people suppose to make it more nicely than they actually are because they can not make them to look bad even they are actually useless products or services .people do not know before they actually try on them .what they only see and watch is all those advertisement on the magazines and on t.v .i think the purpose of advertisements is make people to feel that that products are rvery effective products and it will be nice to use and it will not be wasting of money to buy this products .i think make products seem much better than they really are is necessary for the advertisers and also to customers .who is going to interested in the products that do not have any attractive that make people to say `` wow  ?of course , some of advertisements are too fake but i still think is one of the ways of marketing and nowadays it is getting more better and better .there are a lots of amazingly creative advertisements that normal people never could think about it .it is a creative way to increase their business value .however , i think there are also bad sides of these advertisements .what if customers bought that product and realise it was only nice on t.v and what if they feel the company actually lied them ?however i do not think people are going to be upset because of the diffrences between t.v and the real products because it is a common knowledge that most of advertisements are making their products seem much better than they really are .i think customers should understand the company s advertisements and accept those because as long as there are advertisements in this world , there will not be a single honest advertisement after all .
