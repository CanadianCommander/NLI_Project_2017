i agree with this statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .this why we can see so many companies invast their money in the commerical every year .first , it is fame .maybe one company s product is good , but if there is just few people know it .the product will fail , because it is not famous .of course , the product will not sell well .instead , if today this product is pretty famous , it is easier to sell .for example , i am also play the customer role in my life .i used to buy one famous brand of milk .and i quietly to buy other unfamous brand of milk .if the survey asked me `` why you always buy this brand of milk ?i will answer , because of it is fame , i believe the famous brand is better than others .however , do i really do the reserch about the milk ?and prove it real better than other brands .of course not .second , even the most advertisements enlarge the real funtion of product .but most people still believe that , and they will try to buy it .because they want make their life better .for instance , the energy drink , there are many people drink this kind of beverage .they believe this drink brings them energy and power .somehow , some people even think they can not live without it .is it really have so wonderful effect on the body ?i do nt agree with it .i think the purchasing is result from the advertisement .it makes people believed what they saw .to sum up , i strongly agree with this satement .because i am also the customer in my life .through the advertisements , they meke me to trust their funtion better than they really are in the life .
