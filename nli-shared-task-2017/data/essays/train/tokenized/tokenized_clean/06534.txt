successful people who is doing thingsdo you know what is the best way to be successful when you doing things ?my friend always tell me about doings new things such as in his house or his work or anything .he likes to descover and he wants to make things differently .in my opinion , i think make or do the things you know it already for make sure you will finish it and gain the time .first , people want to finish the things what they have .for example , if your boss gave you research , you should finish it , so you would work for paper with information that gave it to you or from work , so you will finish it because it would be easy for you to do it ; however , you would know the routin to do it .secound , people wikk gain the time .for example , like what i said above you know the routin , so you will finish it early or on time , but if you want to make new things maybe you will not finish it on time , so your boss will be angry .some people think you must do new things because you have to for make new different kinds to be the best and to be evolve .however , it might be true , but maybe you spend a lot of time i mean `` wast the time  because if you did nt make it you will lost the things that you work on it .for example , you will do newspaper .if you did nt make it on time ( new form ) , you will be late to show the custmers and you will lose the custmers also .all in all , the people who do the things what the know it already is better because make people sure to finish it and to gain the time .i hope for people who want to make new things , they think and think more and more before do it if they will make it or no .
