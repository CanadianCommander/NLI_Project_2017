i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people are usually healthier than old people and are full of zest and energy .good health opens a lot of avenues for enjoyment to the youth .they can go bungee jumping or sky diving if they please so .frail health limits the aged .they have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .a lot of fun involves medium to high risk .at a young age , people are able to take a lot of risks in life .there is very less at stake for them .and that is also how they learn .however at an advanced age , it becomes very difficult to take even medium risks and the aged prefer to shun such activities which would involve risk .how many times would anyone have seen grandma riding a motorbike ?the young are more curious than the aged .hence experiencing new things is a source of joy and fun for the youth .however the `` worldly wise  aged has seen it all in life and there is rarely a thing which can excite them the way it excites the youth .while young , people have a better ability to change .the young are tuned into the times .the elderly usually find it difficult to adapt to the changes of the current times .for example , there are not many elderly who are comfortable with the latest technology and gizmos like the computer and the ipod .lastly the world is geared to cater to the needs of the young .besides medical care and certain specialized products for the aged , the tv is full of advertisements targetting the youth and children .a visit to the malls , restuarants , pubs , entertainment parks and movies reiterates the same focus on the youth .the entire economy churns out billions of dollars catering to the whims and fancies of the youth .hence young people definitely have more fun than the elderly .
