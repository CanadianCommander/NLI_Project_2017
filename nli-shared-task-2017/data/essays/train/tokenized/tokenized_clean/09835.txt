well i certainly agree with the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjectwell , i feel that it is always important to have a good knowledge about all different subjects .well for example taken in the medical history , say a doctor from a medicine field , is only specilazed in only one subject or say only one field .and for suppose he is a speacilist in heart diseases , and if a patient comes in for a treatment in different part of the body he will not be or he is not in a position to give him the medicines for that disease .and the patient might think that he has got no knowledge and moreover he might not turn to him again .and if he has a knowledge about many academic subjects he will be able to give a medicine for that .well what i feel is that a person is said to be complete person if he has a good knowledge about all the things .so i feel that it is better to have the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .well , if we are into only one specific subject i say we will endup nowhere , wherein we donot have the knowledge about other things .and this might propably mean that our knowledge in limited .well for example in the software field if we are good in only one basic software and now a days our information and technology is changing day by day , so here we need to have some knowledge about other softwarestooor we will be in a situation where we will end up nowhere , not knowing what to do next .so here we can say that if we have some knowledge about many academic subjects we can survive .
