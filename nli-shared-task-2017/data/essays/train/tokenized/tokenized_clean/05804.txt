i do nt think young people enoy life than older people do .it seem to be so , because younger people are energic and spirited than elder people , and the ranges of action they can do are wider than elder .that s why elder people say `` the yourth enjoy their lif than us .however , i doubt young people is more enjoyed their life than elder people ?the first reason is that the the yourth impossible to escape from comming across the lot of ploblems .the ploblems are may be about friends , parents , future , and oneselfs .they do nt know how to handle them .they have to think over about ploblems , and expelience difficult situtation , and spend hardtime .and then , they finaly find the way of solution by oneself .this process need for growing to adult .and then , when they mature enough , they finally know how to enjoy the life accutually .sometimes , the yourth enjoying themselves mean ecaping from uneasy .so it s not real enjoy .just discourse .and there is also money aspect .for exsample , i love music very much , and also desire to go the gig of the favorite artists .however when i was high school student , i never go the gig , just because id did nt have enough money .but after entering university , i started to work as a ppirt time , and finaly could go the gig .that was wonderful expeliene .but still now , the times i could go the gig is limited .because the capital is shortage .my friend who is already work as full-part time can go the gig whenever she wants .so thai think elder people well know the solution way of difficults they encounter by expelience and have well finance .so , they afford to enjoy their life than the yourth .
