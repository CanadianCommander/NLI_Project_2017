the questions if advertisement make products seem much better as they really are is diffuse .it depends on the product which is pre - sented .there are a lot a products with diffrrent values on the market .first of all everzbodz knews that the reason for advertisement is to present a product , to catch the customers eye and of course to sell it .in a mercedes benz advertisement we can see hightechnological and beautiful car with many extras to make our life on the road safer and more confortable .it has no negative sites except the prize .if we buy this product we get what we have seen in the advertisement without unwilling suprises .but the are also advertisements trying to convince us from a product that is less worth than it is said .mostly they are in a lower finacial category than cars .cosmetical or househeld products often have exagerating advertisement .in one advertisement a woman moans during she washes her her with a special shampoo .that does nt sound realistic but it fullfil the reason .products with the same content but without a good advertisement are cheaper , although they do nt differ from the advertised product .in conclusion , it must be said that a goal of advertisement is to earn as much as possible and that product get more expensive if they are well known .everyone has to consider by his self if it is worth to buy a product .
