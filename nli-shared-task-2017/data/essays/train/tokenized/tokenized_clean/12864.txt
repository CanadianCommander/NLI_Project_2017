why do we see soo many advertisements on tv or in magazines ?many people buy or even recomand things because they saw it on a commercial or in a newspaper .the system works like `` brain washing  .what you see or anybody tells you is good and if you are going to hear it over and over again you are going to believe it some day .i absolutely agree with the statement that `` many products seem much better than they really are  .if you look at the package of an orange juice with a sepcific brand name like `` happy day  you will see a nice green cover with an orange on there .when you are thursty and you go into a supermarcet , i guess that i will pick exactly this product because the cover of it looks awesome .later you are going to open the dring and you will be disappointed .you will find out that it is only sweet and what the producer promises with a commercial slogan like `` 100 % orange juice  , can not be a true thing .another example to underline what i mean would be the commercial of a product which many people already ate at least one time in their lifes .`` pringls - chips  .they have all the same form and they taste good ( in my point of view ) , but a slogan says that they will never become hard because you can close it again with `` una tappa di plastica  .if you are going to open a product it does not matter if it is a yoghurt or a package of chips they will be not fresh after a time .what will happen if you are going to pay in the supermarcet a lot for a simple shaver because everybody bought it and it should be so smooth and soft and there wo nt be any possibilities that you are going to cut yourself with it .a famouse brand name would be `` venus  .after three times the venus shaver is also not going to cut as good as it did at the first day .in my point of view people should not invest so much money in advertisemts .people and many children around the world need financial aid and we should support them and should not support products which we are going to buy anyways .
