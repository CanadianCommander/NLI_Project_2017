in this essay , i will discuss how and why young people enjoy life more than old people .i will use an example from my personal experience to support my opinion .though old people are able to enjoy life , most are not able to enjoy it to its fullest .this may simply be because they are typically not as physically able as young people .a young person is usually able to play sports and participate in other activities which may require substantial physical strength .an older person , however , might not be able to enjoy such acitivites for a very long duration of time .take aggressive in-line skating for example .this is an activity that a group of friends and i frequently indulge in for recreation .we sometimes skate for 3 hours straight .but , when my dad tried to skate , and he was exausted to a point where he couldnt go on after only ten minutes .though my dad was very athletic when he was young , age has slowly stolen his vitality .another reason which old people are not able to enjoy life as much as young people is the inevitable advance of technology .most old people today simply do not like new forms of entertainment .recreation today is quickly shifting from physical activites such as sports towards newer forms of entertainment such as video games .i have noticed that most old people are not willing to enjoy video games .most even refuse to try them out .though they may have liked pong when that first came out , they usually do nt appreciate newer more complex games and dismiss them as meaningless and time wasting .young people on the other hand , are able to appreciate both new and old forms of entertainment .i myself participate in a multitude of sports such as soccer , but i am also an avid video gamer .unfortunately , most old people are not capable of this because of the reasons described above .unfortunately , this leaves them with very few ways of enjoying themselves .
