many people are worried about the quality of the educational system at schools and high schools .one of the debats is if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in my opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .firstly , if you learn ideas or concepts you can apply them in more topics and you can understand other issues based in the same principle .on the other hand , if you learn only facts , you have a little knowledge about a few things or questions .learning ideas does not mean only that the teacher tell you something and you believe it by heart .however , it means that with this idea , you can develop more and apply them in facts .for instance , if someone teaches you the concepts of the physical mouvement of cars , you may transfer it to facts .you will be able to put a car in mouvement if you understood the basic principles .if someone learns only facts , this person will not be able to think by herself because her knowledge and experience is not really wide .therefore , i think that learning ideas and concepts may help the person to develop her mind and way of thinking .however , sometimes people can not understand the ideas or concepts without examples , so they prefer to learn only practical things .to summarize , in my opinion is always better to learn ideas or concepts than only facts because it will be more useful for the future career of students .the students will learn ideas or concepts about one topic but they can extend them to several fields .furthermore , they will develop their skills and improve their way of thinking by themselves .
