it is less important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for then to learn facts .learning facts are more important than comprehending ideas or concepts because ideas and concepts come from facts one has learned .a typical example for this will be hitler and the jewish people .without the allies revealing the secret of what the nazis have done to the jews , the gory , unnecessary holacaust would have been buried and never revealed again .because the allies found out the axis movements , new ideas and concepts have been stated and listed .since facts came out , the ideas came too .another perfect example will be students learning history .by gaining knowledge of horrible events that has happened in the history , such as slavery , asssassination of the best presidents , world war ii , the cold war , or the vietnamese war , students will have more knowlegde and facts to form more opinions .new society with more ideas can only be constructed through students attaining more and more facts .to construct , or at least attempt to construct an utopian community or a better world will only be possible if facts are learned , and brand new ideas are formed .original concepts , mixed with facts are the two most important factors to create the society .a house will be a typical example .if the house is a life , the frames and the base will be the facts , and all the other fancy materials , such as windows , flooring , et cetra , will be the ideas .without the frames , it is impossible to have the fancy materials to stand .therefore , is it much more important for students to learn facts rather than comprehending ideas or concepts .because without the facts , existence of ideas and concepts will be not allowed .
