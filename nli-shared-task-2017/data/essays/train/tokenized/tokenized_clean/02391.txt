i definitely would not like to opine with this statement .i would rather like the same statement if its slightly rebuilt or modified .first of all , whom should we consider successful people ?those who tried new things just in time when there was demand and that too in their field only or those people who contributed to the complete generation of the ideas relevant to the topic .well in my opinion there are many people who hit the limelight by making lots of money .do we call them successful people ?if that was the case i would agree if microsoft ventured into the steel segment .i would agree if dell starts to sell pizza in the future .i would agree so if `` intel  can start a university and so on .you can ask thousands of questions like that for yourself .but the crux of the matter is , how much a person knows about his/her business ?how much is the quantum of knowledge or trend generated by him/her that is applicable in toto various other fields .how often is the risk experienced by the people that necessitated for such innovative concepts .you often find people investing money in inventions only to sustain their own business .i would not like to call them successful people .i feel that the chain stores run by some business entities should be considered successful .in chain stores , the products are being sold , the variety of products and customer service increases .this inturn , increases his expertise to sell various other products .you can talk about a grocery store owner selling cosmetics and then starts to sell medicines , and then a gas station and so on and excelling in all the areas of business .this in my opinion is called success , the concept acheived in one store is being built across various other fields .there
