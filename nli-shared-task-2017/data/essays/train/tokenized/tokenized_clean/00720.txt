in my opnion , the number of cars that are in use today will not be reduced in the next twenty years .in fact , i feel the number of cars will increase in the coming years .i agree with the statment because of some valid reasons which are stated below .firstly , if we look at other modes of transportation available to general public , there is no other mode of transportaion which is so much comfortable and independent .one can finsh so many daily activities and save time by having a car .travelling by train is not an easy task during peak office hours and if one is little late to the railway station , he or she misses the train and has no other option than to wait for sometime to catch another train .this has so many other implciations on that persons daily routine .secondly , the price of cars are going down daily .this has made cars easily accessible to the middle class family also .they can plane to a get a small car which fits there budgets and satisfy there daily needs .for example , a four seater car in indian market is available for 2 lakhs , which is very less as compared to the price of the same car few years back .thridly , there are many activities in daily life which have been directly related to cars .for example , imaging a person going on a date for the first time .these couple will not prefer to go in a public bus .they will prefer to go in the car .other example can be , normal mode of transortation all not accessible at all the places .so , in order to reach some remote places , one has no other option then to go by car .there many other activities like going for a dinner with family , which can be easliy managed by having a car .there are some major issues because of increasing number of cars on the roads .one of them is increase in pollution level in the atmosphere .this can lead to so many injurious diseases like lung cancer .but i feel , govertment can plan some other ways to check and control the pollution level .in my view this can be checked by making laws related to vehicle pollution more strict and punishable .so , in my opnion the use of cars will increase in the coming years because in present world having a car is not a luxory but a neccessity .
