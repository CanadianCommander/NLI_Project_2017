i disagree with this statement .i think it is much more important to learn facts that actually illustrate an idea , than to understand concepts and ideas .indeed , the latter are abstracts and thus , more difficult to memorize .on the other hand , a fact talk from itself .oncefor example , in marketing we are taught a lot of theories which are said to make a product more attractive , or to make a firm more succesfull ; we have to learn these theories by heart which is difficult for a lot of students , as they do nt have the opportunity to actually test this idea .fatcs would actually help them to understand each and every step of the theory , and understand why there has to be a theory by practicing .this way of learning is what students of work-study programs experienced .they are taugh a lot of examples about the theory they are about to learn , and they have to practice what they are learning , and to learn what they practice .for instance , they will spend two weeks at shool , during which they will analyse several examples on a selected topic , and learn the theory .the next step will be two weeks at workduring which they will have the chance to try , experience , and test what they have been taught .and this process happens every month .this method makes it more easier for the students because they have the opportunity to put their knowledge in practice .and if they do nt understand a point during class , they will have the opportunity to get to understand it during their practice weeks , and to ask proffessionals about the question .learning facts should be the first step in the learning-process , followed by the theory step , and then , by the put-in-practice step .
