i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think this is a misconception arising due to the outdated views on how a community is defined and also the ways to help the community .the complaint seems to be that the youth are so self-indulgent and selfish in pursuing their own career goals and ambitions that they do not devote enough time to community .but we must recognize that the individual is the basic unit of society .so if the individual does something to improve his or her quality of life , the overall average quality of life of the community increarses .in turn such people also inspire other people to better their lives and start a progressive trend .it is a situation similar to say a scientist isolating himself from society to excel in his inventions , but then the fruits of innovation are shared by all .a more serious aspect of this complaint can be the supposed indifference of the youth towards their community .this complaint also has roots in how do we define the community traditionally .in today s ever shrinking world where more and more people of different communities come together and work , the youth seem to be embracing a larger community , and their commitments to this emerging but broader community might seem to affect their contribution towards their local community .again , i would argue that if the youth are working towards some greater common good then that is bound to benefit all in the long run .another point i would like to make is that if the young people devote relatively more time towards their self development , they will be more stable and more capable of helping back the community .basically they would be able to help the community ina better way and even in more impactful way .for example , many institutions benefit from the funds and projects that their alumni bring back to their alma-mater .the real problem can be when the young people are not doing something constructive and productive .we definitely need to guard against such apathy towards oneself and hence the society .but this malady does not restrict itself to young people only and hence it would be wrong to blame only the young for such behavior .in fact , i think that young people are more enthusiastic and less cynical than most of the older generation .in summary , i would assert that an individual is the basic unit of society .as long the individual is involved in something that is constructive or beneficial to at least the person himself , the overall community is bound to get the benefits sooner or later , not neccesarily in explicit terms but in more subtle and impactful ways .
