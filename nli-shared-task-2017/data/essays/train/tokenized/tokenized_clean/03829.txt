last night while i was preparing for my history of economic analysis exam , i really spent a lot of time in learning ideas and concepts rather than the facts .i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are many reasons of this situation .first of all , ideas and concepts are more important than facts in the exams .in general , the questions are about ideas and concepts .the teachers place them too much importance , they spent too much time about them in the classes and moreover they want too much knowledge from students about ideas and concepts in the exams .for example , in my exams the questions are generally related with the ideas and concepts rather than facts .therefore , i work for the ideas and concepts much .another reason is that in education system in my country , it is not very necessary to know the facts .on the other hand , the education systems encourages the students to learn and understand ideas and concepts .ideas and concepts have more pages than the facts in course textbooks and they are discussed in more detail than the concepts .therefore , the students place a bigger importance on ideas and concepts than facts .understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding the facts for the students .to learn about the ideas and concepts can help students more in the exams and the education system also encourages students to learn them rather than learning the facts .
