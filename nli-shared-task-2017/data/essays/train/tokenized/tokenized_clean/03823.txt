people nowadays have a variety of choices to go out .they can go by plane , car , bike or even by spaceship .since there are a lot of inventors still trying hard to bring out something new , i do believe that 20 years later , there will be considerably fewer cars .i remembered reading a piece of news which said that a corporation in germany has already succeeded in producing a kind of car that can both run on a road and fly in the sky .doors of the car can be used as `` wings  when the driver presses a special button in the car which instructs it to go up into the sky .though it wo nt be produced in huge amount very soon , there are chances that it ll become popular one day .and they have possibility to take the place of cars .there s another reason that i believe the number of cars is going to decline , which is because technology is getting more and more advanced , we will never know what will be invented in the future .maybe a car with much more seats than we have today , or a kind of bicycle allowing 20 persons to ride at the same time .future is mysterious , and you never know what is going to happen .besides large cars , innovative transportation and super size bicycle , a decent in population is sure to contribute to a drop in the number of cars .many developed countries , such as the swiss , germany , the united states and great britain etc. are all facing the problem of lack of youth .not many newly-married couples choose to have kids , so this directly leads to the situation .since there will be fewer people in the world , how can there be more cars on the roads ?well , these are the explanations for my choice , and i really hope a decent in cars will occur because there are so many accidents which have killed lots of people , and the bad effect they have brought to our unique atmosphere around the earth .
