the question of take risks and try new things rather than continue his habits , is a very important question to ask himself in order to know what kind of life we want to live .in my opinion , take risks and try new things is the best choice for many reasons .first , if you try to do new things , you can discover new products or find new idea .and this is the best way to succeed if you want to succeed because if you do something that someone have ever done , the copy will be less good than the original .for example , the richest people in the world are often someomes who invent something and thus who took risks before .secondly , the life is more interesting and really amazing when you take risk .in fact , you never know what will happen .therefore you ca nt worry .furthermore , i think that people are more interested to speak with you if you can tell them about a new and original subject .thirdly , if you take risks , you can do something different of others activities .and that s more exciting .furthermore , how to succeed if you try nothing and if you just follow the others .indeed someome who succeed is someome who work a lot and who do what he wants to do .for that , it s important to take risks .to conclude , i m sure that if you want to be a successfull people , you had to take risks and was nt be affraid to do new things .furthermore life is more interesting if you do nt what you will do next days , weeks or months .
