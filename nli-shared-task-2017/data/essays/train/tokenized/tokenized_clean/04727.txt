as to which it is better , taking a number of academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject , the answer depends on a student s personal development .to tesify it , we should look into both of the position .for one thing , as a undergraduate student , you are supposed to take multitude of academic subjects .this does be benifical for you .to begin with , while taking various subjects , students exploit their ability , and find out what they really interest in .take my own experience for example , thanks to our university s education system , i need nt to choose my subject as a freshman .in the first two years , i took every classes attacting me .therefore , when i am junior now , i exactly know what subject is my love .in contrast , my best friend yu was nt as lucky as me .indeed , she is regreting to choose history every minute nowadays .therefore , it is too haste to specialize in a pecular in undergratude schools .moreover , having a great many of academic subjects not only helps develop a databse for a student , but also helps a student to make friends and build his/her personal social relasionships .at the some time , if you are a graduate student , unquestionably , you ought to specialize in one specific subject .because once a student decides to have further study , which means he/she already has a well-defined purpose , he/she are advisable to choose the career for all life .and nnly when studying in a graduate school , does a student concentrate on a subject .subsequently , a student are supposed to engross in the research and have outcome from it .furthermore , most of companies require applicants who are proficient on a special fields .if the applicants has the expertise , the corporation will pay high salary for it .as you can see from the above-mentioned text , the answer to the statement varies .there are circumstances where requires expertise , while there are other circumstances where broader knowledge is splendid .thus , i both agree and disagree with the statement .
