i definately agree with the statement that it is important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts for the reasons below .first , understanding concepts can lead one to more profound information while only learning facts can only be just knowing facts .because just like trees , under the big concept branches grows .this idea applies every subject people study .for example , when learning history , people can possibly say `` hitler caused the world war ii.  which is true , but in this situation we do not know why hitler did .however if one say hitler caused the world war ii because germans were so overwhelmed with the treaty of versailes and germany wanted to show that they are powerful , it will make more sense , and it will be more easier to understand it as well .second , understanding concept can save large amount of time .for students , using their the time properly is very important .breaking their time wisely can make their life easier and sometimes they even determines their success as well .in my opinion understanding concept instead of learning facts is more productive way of studying .as i mentioned above , understanding concepts not only leads to more information but also leads to know the facts faster .once , i had friends who did not spend much time on studing but getting better grade , and who was so struggling with their study and spent great chunk of time , but did not get a good grade on it .and i realized that their approach to the topic was different .the smart one was trying to get the big picture of it while one was trying to see the small parts of it .when drawing a picture , people measure and sketch it first instead of drawing details .because if not , the whole structure collapse .for those reasons , it is very important to see and understand the big concept rather than learning facts .
