it will be better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects because after you have all those academic subjects in your brain cells you wo nt be have to worry any problems with class work .for my first point of view will be that if we have all those knoledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we wo nt have to ask the classmates about the problems that we have .we can solve it ourself .it will be better to do it yourself than asking the others because it will be quite embarrasing .you will have to look at others face just to wait for their answer and i ll prefer not to do that .nextly will be to get a better grades because we have many academic subjects in our heads normatter how many subjects in a day we will be able to know must of the needs in the topic .and than at the end of the year or tearm when the grades come out you will be proud of your ownself .some more students will come to you and ask you the question that their do nt understand so you can be their teacher to teach them what ever thing their need and they will look up on you my last point will be the teachers , sometimes you can find the teacher struggling on some questions and you can prom them by telling them some clues so they will know what to do after all .you might be able to be their top students as will .so whenever they need help with their work you can teach them .they might give you a better effect and grade .my conclusion is that we surely better to have a board knowledge and many academic subjects in the brain than haveing blank in the head when you are doing some kind of test .
