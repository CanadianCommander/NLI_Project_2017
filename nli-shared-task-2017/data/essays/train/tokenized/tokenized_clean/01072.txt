the issue of the quantity and the quality of knowledge required to succeed is a very old one : in fact we today know that nobody can have the so-called ` total knowledge  of the world .this was probably possible three or four centuries ago , when the state of our scientific knowledges was limited , that is why scientists , philosophs or writers like goethe , rousseau , pascal have surely known everything when they lived .but it is an utopy today , and in our everyday life the question that comes often is : do i have to follow a generalist or a specialized cursus ?i personnaly agree with the statement underlining the idea that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic areas than to know everything about one area , like cells biology or ship construction , for example .my view is surely subjective because i made a french ` classe preparatoire  before being admitted , two years ago , in a business school in france .so i had to study during two years no less than 8 academic classes : mathematics , french , history , economy , english , german , philosophy , computer skills .each one was very important and often evaluated with both writed and oral assessments .to my mind follwing a great number of classes at the young age is a very constructive and usefull way to be educated : on this purpose all countries all over the world proceed this way until the child becomes a teenager .but after that each country has its own view on education : germans will prefer to choose a specialization very soon ( with 13 or 14 ) whereas france or the united states gives a priority to long studies at the university .i remember a day when i was in ` classe preparatoire  , a professor of philosophy felt that few people followed his class , and he told one of the students that in spite of his probable future of financial manager , dealing with numbers and banks all the day , he will miss his classes of philosophy because it gave him a way to think about everything in the life .this explanation of our professor created by me a new view on subjects i did nt appreciate , and now i make efforts to interest me on each business point that i have to study at school .but to conclude with , i naturally understand that i will have to decide me for a specific orientation to my professional future very soon .it is necessary , but i think that in a highly evolutive labour market , it is a n opportunity in conceiving to do very differnt things in his career .
