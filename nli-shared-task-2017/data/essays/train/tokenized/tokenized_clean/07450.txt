according to me i feel that it is the best thing for a person to have better knowledge about specialized subject rather than seeking knowledge about several subjects for several reasons .firstly seeking knowledge about a particular subject can make him a master in that subject .he can expertise soley in the subject .for example if you are interested in general science .you can concentrate on that subject only and know the subject study the subject deeper .secondly a person can study the sub jecft and know the deeper strengths and lines of the subject .the person can get a chance to know and study more details about the subject .in contrast if we concentrate on all subjects we may not achieve perfecton in any of them .thirdly there is a saying that a person can do only one thing at one time .for example if a person dream is to become a scientist , it is of no use if he concentrate on other subjects such as economics or arts etc .although they are only important for him to have a basic idea about this subjects not any thing thing more because they donot contribute him to reach his target or his destination .fourthly a person may get several opportunities in future which may wecome him or her .for example if a person attends an interview he or she may be asked that in which subject or area you are specialised , or interested .based on his specilization of subject the interviewer may ask the questions .a person gets an opportunity to be an expert or master of his subject being specialised .to sum up although other academic subjects are also basically important to seek knowledge but it is always a good idea or beneficiary to be an expert in any particular subject .it is bette to lspecialize in one rather than mixing of all other subjects .
