first of all .i agree with `` most advertisements make products seem much better than thy really are.  because if i have company then i make some advertisments for some products .and i show them in the tv for the people , also i show them in the streets , but i shwo them in a bad way .i mean they were seem bad or ugly .then nobady going to by anything from my commpny .they going to put ex on it ( all the people goning to heat it ) .any way any one wants to make an advertisements have to show them seem gret way .to attreact people to that kind of product wich mide the advertisements for it .here is the example for two people mide two advertisments for two diffrent kinds of bayby milk .the first ont showed the bayby milk with darty stuff and with sick child .also the pearson showed that advertisment with bad music .the second one showed the bayby milk with clean stuff and with cutte bayby .also with nice music .now here is the bottom line .the people who wictched the two advertisements , wich kind of milk they are going to buy ? .difnlay the second one , because it has really great stuff and really great way to ahwo the bayby milk .that even in other products .itis depend how the product showing .and wht the gifts come with it .also if it has good offer or not .i mean it is depend how is the product shwoing .that was my opinion if i agree or disagree with `` most advertisments make products seem much better than the really are .and igreed with that .
