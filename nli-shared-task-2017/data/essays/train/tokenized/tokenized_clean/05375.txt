it is known that educational system is always discussed by the politiciens and of course a lot of families who are interested in future of their children .learning concepts or learning the real facts is one of the discussions .because these ideas are both very essential for students because of many reasons .firstly i vant to point out that students charge with learning a lot of important information because they can be get everything when they are children .moreover , for their cultural improvements , they have to learn many about our phylosophy , history and the concepts .of course  it is very important that they have to understand the ideas .i have to say that this type of information give the students perfectly .in my opinion , there is not problem in this idea .however students have to learn about another issues - i can say ` real issues  .because there a lot of students who are very clever and know concepts but can not have any idea about the current events all over the world .in this situation we must focus on this type of education .in my opinion when we talk about the lack of good education , also we must think about us , families .as i said in the first paragraph , all families want to educate their children in a good way .according to the some people families can improve their children in their houses too .it is not incredible because of a lot of advantages .for instance , a student can learn a lot of things with his or her theacher at school but at the same time when student get up he can read a newspapers to learn about what is going on .furthermore , his family help him of course and this way maybe he learn thinking .as a conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both are very important information for students in this way which i talk about .
