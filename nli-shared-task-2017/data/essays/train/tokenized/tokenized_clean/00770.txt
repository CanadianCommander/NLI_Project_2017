its quiet realistic to say that after twenty years there can be more cars in use than today .its not agreeable with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years because of several worth notable reasons behind it .firstly , the increase of the population and the earning capabilties of the individuals .the percapita income of any individual is increasing day-by-day .so , with the increase of the percapita income of the individual the sale of the cars areb also increasing and also the increase of population increases the growth sales of cars which are basic means of transport in the form of taxis , cabs e.t.c .secondly , the new technologies attracting the people with their new designs and making better efficient engines makes the people buy these cars .one more reason to attribute is that these automobile companies introducing the two-seater cars into the market have attracted a large number of middle class people to buy these cars .the other reasons may be - so many new car companies emerging and attracting people and also the older or the faded stocks of the cars tempts the decline of the rates/costs of these cars , which enables all kinds of people to have a car .neverthless of very high cost of some cars , some people try to own them because having a car of very high prize like the suv s , the porsche or the mecedes-benz is a symbol of prestige in the society .so , in view of all the above reasons one can agree or come to a conclusion that in the coming future , it may be twenty years or some hundred years there is no chance of decline in the usage of the cars .
