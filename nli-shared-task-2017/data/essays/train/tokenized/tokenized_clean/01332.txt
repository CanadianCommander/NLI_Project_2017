advertisement is everywere !it is hardly impossible to escape from it .on the one hand you get a lot of information about new products but on the other hand it is nearly impssible to stop it .in my opinion advertising does not make products better as they are , it manipulates us in different ways so that we buy the product .advertisment tries to show us the opportunitys and advantages we might have when we will buy this particular product .it could also create new needs .some time ago nobody would belive , that we would drink water out of bottles .it was the advertisement which told us , that only the water in the bottles are clean .and on the other side they told us that the water out of the tin is dirty although it is nearly the same .advertisement does show products in an other way .it has to because otherwise we would not even notice , that we miss something .with a lot of competition in the market every product has to be something special and unique .nobody would buy just an ordirnary chocolat bar or just a shirt .brands and the trust that people have towards them is very important .advertisment trys to create emotions .when we go to the supermarket and we would like to buy some sweets we should remember that good feeling as the girl in the advertisment tasted this chocolate bar and how happy she was .this picture should lead us to buy this product .the product does not differ from other ones but we get influenced by the advertisement .the reason for doing advertisin is that the selling increases because of it .with that background you might think that the statement is completely true .but as i mentioned in the text it has a lot more to do than just showing there product .the connection between the customer and the product is much more important than just the selling numbers of the next month .the difficulty of advertisement is to make a bond between the two sides so that the customer will only buy the own products now and in the future .that might be the biggest challenge in that business .
