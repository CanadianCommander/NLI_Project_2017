in my point of view , old peolpe are more happy of there life than young people .there are three reasons to this opinion .first , young people have a lot of problems .then you study you have all the stress of the examination .furthermore , it s in this perdiod of life that you have to decidate of your future and you know it .you are conscient that all your decision will have a very big effect on your avenir .second , older persons are more able to appreciate than the young generation .the oldest genaration have experience so they are more able to take in account what happen .they already achive something in there life so this people are more confidente .for exemple , when a 18 years old man felt in love we certanly not realise the chance that he have .on the over hand a 45 years old man realise exactly the chance that he have when he is in love .finaly , although some people think that because students make more party they enjoy more there time .it s well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at this party , covert only the problems of this persons .in conclusion , i will said that because of the too stressful situation that is accepted with alcool and the security and experience of old generation ; young people do nt enjoy life more than the older people do .
