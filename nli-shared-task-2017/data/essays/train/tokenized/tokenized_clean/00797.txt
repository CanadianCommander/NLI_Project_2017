nowdays , more and more students sucess their baccalaureat .however , it appears that their knowledge are not very good .therefore , some people think that we have to re-organize the educational system .so , is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?first , the comprehension of something begins in observing facts .for example , in chemistry , we can do an experience , observe its , and then we have to understand the reaction .so , i think that it is really important to understand ideas and concepts .it is the first step of the knowledge .it is the minimum .next , if we forget this ideas and concepts , it is not important to understand it !but education can not stop here .if we only understand ideas and concept , we do not have enough knowledge to understand other things .to improve its knowledge , we have to learn facts .indeed , learn facts equals get experience .in the schorlarship , learn facts must mixt with `` understand ideas and concepts  .in one time , students only learnt courses by heart and sometimes they did not understand .thus , if students only learn lessons , it is not enough .in my opinion , a good educational sytem is not only a system where students just learn facts .they olso have to understand ideas and concepts : it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .we can not done a difference between this two system .
