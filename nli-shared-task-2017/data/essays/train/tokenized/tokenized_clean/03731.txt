in todays scanario it seems that cars are the important part of life and driving a car is status simble .by viewing the growth in production of cars and uses it seems that in future time all the ways are overcrowded by cars .but i believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of some strong reason like fuel problem , awairness about pollution and health problem causing by cars .fuels are limited on the earth .in world very small regions are known where fuel are found .fuel are the main source of cars .due to a large quantity of consumption the scarsity of fuel has been generated and the prices are growing up and up .so when fuel is ended their is no cars on the road and automatically reduces the cars .now people are very well known about the harmfull effect of pollution which is causing by cars after the burning of petrol .it causes severe health problem like asthama and other breathe related problem .people do nt want to take risk on their life .pollution also causes the environmental changes by which all the inhabitants are affected .and the last reasion that due to spending more time in car people are affectd with their back problem and getting fat which causes the disease .i would like to give an example that in recent newspaper study shows that due to using cars and lacking exercise 60 % people have suffering from back pain in the age of 30 .so when they consult with the doctor and knew about the reason most of them leave the cars and start the uses of bicycle .although it is true that it seems very difficult that the cars are decreased in 20 year but most of the people thinking about bicycle which causes no pollution , and also good for health , also reduses the risk of accident are good for them .they also adappted cycles and certain countries the cars are also decreases due to awairness of people .so i belive that in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
