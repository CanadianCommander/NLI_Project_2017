there is a famous saying that says , `` all facts are made out of prejudice of our ancestors .hence , i agree with the statement .although facts can be seen as a short cut toward studying , i belive it is more important to teach the students ideas and concepts then lead them toward the knowing facts .going though this process , the student may have a changeable mind and an ability to turn ideas and concepts into facts .if the teachers in school teaches only fact , the people who study there will become computers , for they only have to remember the text and they can pass the exams .on the other side , the students have more challange and will learn more .for example , if a biology teacher only teaches a frog is a slimy kind of animal that can live in both water and land , can the students pick the right animal when a turtle and a frog is presented to him .on contrasy , if the students are given the idea of learning by experiencing themselves , the differences of the two animal shall be easy .another reason that i agree more on learning ideas and concepts are , most of the great inventions are started .youngs should learn how the great scientist acheve their success by starting on ideas and concepts others never or do not dare to think of .explaining the reflextion of a water based on the idea of light that run between the water and the face is more educational than just telling them , `` because there is a reflextion it is true .most importantly the students need to learn is the process between the ideas to the facts .it is how things work and knowledge form , from the question you find to the solution you make after cutting out all the other posibilities .only if they get this ability , they can learn more and learn deep into the subject , and they can find the useful facts for life .therefore , by only understanding the process between the ideas and concepts to the facts , the students may really learn something useful for their lives .
