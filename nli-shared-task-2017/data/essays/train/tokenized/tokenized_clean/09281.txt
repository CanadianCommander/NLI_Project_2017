i believe this statement is true , but i would rather blame the community or the society than the youth .our society have gone through lots of changes in the last century .in the past , the society of the middle age was built around the community and the village and further the basic family , which is the father , the mother and the children .there was no needs to leave the house , unless mariage , and the school was mostly for the wealthy .this type of organisation made it easy , and essential , for the community and especially the youngest to work hand in hand for the community , for instance on the field , because the life of the all the community relied on the amount and the quality of crops .and also because the yougest had no choice than to work for the community in order to securize their own existence .the society of the 21st century is pretty much different from that picture .the young from the age of 3 or 4 to the age of 22 or 23 has to go to school in order to learn a profession and find his place in the society .as soon as you got a job , the security you were obtaining through the middle age community in the past , is all gained through your salary .the today world has become very oriented on the person itself , and not so much on the community .people raise their children alone , go to work and come back at evening and prepare for the same ritual the next day .commercials appearing all the time on television or radio send clear messages `` goods for your personal needs  as a person .the sense of community has almost disappeared from the screen .another factor to the discharge of the youth of today , is the lack of time .talking about school or workplace , things have to be done more efficiently in a shorter period of time .so it become more difficult for people to concentrate on the problems of the others .that reaction is exactly the one of the youth of today , which should nt be blamed but the society we are living in .
