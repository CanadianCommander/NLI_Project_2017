i agree with this statement .i am 18 years old , so i can be said one of young people .actually i am the one who do not give enough time to helping one s commnication .i moved when i am a elementary school student and i went to non-public school in my junior high and high school days .so i have not so many people in my city .neither do my parents .i live in an apartment house and have little relative with the resident .it is said that people live in an apartment house have little frendship nowadays , i think so too .and more my family including me buy foods in derivary service , so i do nt know about my city s shops .most of young people nowadays may be same as my lifestyle .especially if one does not born and bred in the city where one lives now , one have less relative to and pay less attention to their community .and if one s parents is familiar to the city where they live , they tend to become less connection to their community .i also belive that there is another attractive place like standing shoppingmall in the place where they do not live .so people do not stay in their community and go anothe community .of course every young people thesedays do not live like that .some have the experience to join the festival , matsuri or some sports that was held by community , and others have connection to community s president or some person , therefore they knows a lot about event held by community .however people like that is not so many .this is why i belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
