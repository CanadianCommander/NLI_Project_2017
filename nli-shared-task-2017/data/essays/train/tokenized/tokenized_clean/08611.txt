some people ca nt travel without a perfect organization , without to know where they will be on each days and everything .to my point of view this is not the best way to travel .i prefer traveling by myself without a group let by a tour guide .there is many reason who explain this idea : first of all , it is more conveniant and you feel free to do what you want , secondly because you can be integrated to the culture and not only visit touristic place .on the first hand , when you are with a group led by a tour guide you know the program before to leave your country .you have no surprise and can not decide to change your plans .you do not have the possibility to like a place and want to spend more time because most of the time , you must look at you clock and follow the group .for example , when i was in florida , in miami , i decided to go with my friend to visit key west .on the way to go , we get lost and , by the way , we discover other beautiful place that we would not be able to see with a tour guide .then we spend one night in key west as we planed to do but we really enjoyed the city and wanted to stay more .so we just did it , without any problems : we were totaly free to enjoy in our way .on the other hand , when you are with a tour guide , you most of the time only visit the touristic place and where everybody go .you see and visit what all the others see and visit and you are not able to know place that nobody know or where only the citizens go .also , by traveling with a group , you only speak your own languages and you not have any possibilities to know and experiment about the other cultures .as an example , when i was in china , i met a girl who invite me for a dinner in her house .it would never happen with a tour guide because i should follow all the group .so because i was free to do what i wanted to do , i had a dinner with a traditional chinese family and it was such a great experience !to conclude , when you have the possibility to travel by yourself , without any help , it is better to do it without a tour guide : you are free and even if you get loose , you will learn a lot about the culture .so lets go and for your next holidays : be your own tour guide !
