planning to see fewer cars in use in twenty years is a good perspective but i can hardly imagine it .i can only consider it as an illusion .basically , people enjoy driving to go working , shopping or to the beach .if you live in a city , i would encourage you to observe and count as many cars as possible for one minute .i guess you would be surprised .it appears to be quite clear that some people really need a car .first , a car , it is useful .it is useful by the fact that you can get anywhere , at any time , the way you want .the only thing that may slow you down is traffic jams .and when you live far from any city , any shop , any bus stop , a car is very useful .then , a car , it can reveal something else .this is part of the thing you can also notice ( when you are observing on the pavement ) , it is the number of people in the cars .you can hardly see more than two ( except when it is a family and when they are two children at the back ! ) .yes , because owning a car has always been a sign of power .we live in a society where people feel like buying and owning new and often expensive thnigs in oder to be proud of them and expose them .people who make advertisements know that and have used this idea so many times .and especially the cliche about middle-age men driving a fast and powerful car .it is said that you could describe people according to the car they ve got and vice-versa .i guess in our current societies , it is a sign of power , of prosperity and modernity .and this is not going to change . ..and the last but not least important fact it the evolution , over the last years , of the means of transport in any city all over the world .bangkok is a good example .the skytrain as well as the undergroung are sometimes crowded but not so much .there are seats available quite often .the only thing you can notice and you have probably been noticing it for a long time now is that the roads keep being flooded by cars !it may be better and less than before but before seeing fewer cars in use , we will probably have to wait more than twenty years .
