concerning the fact to imply oneself in community life , young people probably feel a lack of trust in the authorities and do nt want to participate any ; ore to the social life .the first thing to notice is that we nowadays live in an individual society .it means young people have to do their best to succeed in their own life and do nt have to care about others .of course , it would be quite disappointing to state that everybody behaves this way .i think there is a feeling of solidarity which is growing more and more .however , we should face the reality .helping others is a form of generosity , and generosity is generally totally free .the problem is that it is the only free thing in our way of life .young people have to work hard , either at school to get a good employment later , or just already as an employee .and you guess that working takes time .so should young people prefer helping others for free or working to make a livind and assure themselves a better life , to live in our current consumtion society .helping others was apparently a kind of tradition before , and as said above , the way of life has changed .that creates a major mentality gap between young and elderly people .we now assist to a serious misunderstanding between generations , because our priorities have been remade .helping for older people is , i guess , accomplish small actions , as for example , supporting someone who has got some physical problems , in daily life .young people obviously can do it , but if a survey would compare behaviours of different generations , there is no doubt that kind of behaviour has decreased .however , i think through work and study , young generation is planning the best solution for its future .by producting , selling , buying , i should say working , that is to our national economy that we provide an advantage .and i am sure the country survival will enable to create appropriated services .or even , if young people are glad to be this country , they will be granted of a new quality : generosity !
