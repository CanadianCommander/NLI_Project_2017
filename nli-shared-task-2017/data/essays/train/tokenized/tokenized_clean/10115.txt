young people do not have the necessary knowledge to enjoy life .one could argue that their lack of experience is an obstacle for them because they sometimes give too much importance for a bad news which appear at the end not to be so bad .with their experience older people know better what is really important .they are wiser than young people - this is often illustrates in the tales where the old man represents wise and knowledge .they have learn a lot from some past events the youth only knows through historical books .they also have had the time to read a lot , tro travel . ..all these elements help them to understand better the world .this could be a bad thing too : it is sometimes better not to be aware of the situations in order to enjoy life .people would sometimes prefer to return to their child-time , when they were innocent .moreover old people do not have the same physical faculties as young people .in the majority of cases when people are mentally matured to enjoy life , they are no more physically capable of it .all this points are based on general observations but happiness is not only a mater of age and depends on every person .enjoyable moments result from on a lot of things , including some events we can provoke and some events we can not control .
