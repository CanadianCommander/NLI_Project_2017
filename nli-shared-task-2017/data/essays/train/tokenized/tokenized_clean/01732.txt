the importance of ideas and concepts in our lifei am a hundred percent agree that `` understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than learning facts  .facts are generally the result of the ideas and concepts , while facts are the given situations or just the results .ideas and concepts and facts have a relationship like the visible and invisible part of an iceberg .as you all know the visible part of an iceberg is very insignificant if we compare it to its invisible part .therefore if students learn the ideas and concepts they will understand the reasons and causes of a fact .if they do so they will respond to the facts differently and more maturly .by learning ideas and concepts it will be easier for them to change the world into a better place but just learning the facts will not help them do that .in generally the ideas and concepts play a role in the formation of the facts .for example , blindness is a fact but producing smth as a blind person is related to the concepts and ideas .poverty is a fact but changing this situation into a better one is to do with ideas and concepts .of course it has to do with the will power .without the will power we ca nt change the facts that surround us .that is the reason why understanding ideas and concepts is more meaningful in my opinion .the ideas and concepts in the world that make a change and have an effect on the facts .
