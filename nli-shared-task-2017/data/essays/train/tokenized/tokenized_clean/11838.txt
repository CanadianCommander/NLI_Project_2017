i personaly think that there are substantial number of people who think this statment is true and i am one of them .the retionale behind this is that the advertisment is the best way to introduce new product and let potential custers get attention to the products .consequently leading the public to buy this product is the final goal .in order to make the people come and buy the products , advertiment should be more impetus and sensational and advetisment make products seem much better than they really are .advertising company use a celebrity to advetise the goods becuase people can easily think that if the celebrity uses a certain product , the goods are good enough to buy and people can get the wrong percetion about a product only because the celebrity uses .for example , in my country , many advetising companies use one famous commerical star whose name is ji-hyun jeon becaus all the items which she advertised made great sales .the public regards all the items that she uses as higher-quality than they actually are .i think the celebrity s word on th tv commerical makes the products look better .moreover , the advertisment is itself very costly .so the advetisements should be enough to get attention wihin a short time or small space with expressions that can let the people get imagation that the products are good to buy .for this reason , the companies use computer graphic to make the products .to illustrate , i have a bad experience that i bought the ear rings online becuase the products of on line adveristment looked so fancy and i was very temping to buy and bought .however after i recived the actual products , i was so upset .in a nutsell , for these reasons , i strongly agree this statemtn and advetisment shoud be improved for fair
