some people say that young people have more fun in life than the elderly .in my opinion these people are absolutely right in saying that .besides of body weakness and deseases their are a number of reasons why young people have more possibilities to really enjoy life .although already mentioned in the introduction , i want to underline the importance of physical fitness once again .not only that older peole are far more often sick , their bodies are just not functionning the way young bodies do .this is examplified in sports .in my opinion sports are very important for the quality of one s life .there is no denying the fact , that the elderly do not perform as well in sports as younger people .one can see this in professional sports .it happens rarely that a person older than 35 is playing soccer in german bundesliga .moreover old people often have to quit doing sports because of physical problems .another aspect regarding physical fitness is the time of recovering after a desease or an injury .it just takes far more time for older people to recover completely .an addional important advantage of young people is that they still have so many things to experience .young people can learn every day new things .not only in an educational way .the youngers have a lot more opportunities to get to know new friends .people in that age connect much easier .furthermore as a young person one does not have as many commitments .old people are often settled and living a very organized life .in contrast , young people can decide to study and live abroad for a certain time - or forever - without having to discuss this with a wife and children .you are just more independant .to come to a conclusion , i am very happy being young .i still have the opportunity to enjoy my life as much as possible .this does not mean that i am affraid of getting older .i just think that i have to do certain things now as i will not be able to do them later - when i am one of the elderly .
