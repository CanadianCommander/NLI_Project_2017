in my opinion i generally believe when people want to be successful in their life they have to try out new things and take risks .i admit that some people can be also successful when their doing their thing in a way that they are familar with and going better in the future becaue of more routine and experiences .however , in my view when you will be realy successful you must have the courage going risks and try something new for two reasons changing the view how to do things better and decreasing the procedure costs .first reason , doing thing in the same way can be very uneffective and it is better to change the procedure .in my job experience i have heard a lot the sentence : `` this have we always made in this particular way and it was good so .however , sometimes a particuar work will stuck and nobody have the courage to change things , because nobody will feel guilty for a failure of changing the workingsystem .second reason , changing the procedure of a particular job or decision can decline the costs in a company .for instance , to change the production department to an abroad country can be connected with some risks factors that could not predict but the company has the change to decrease the production costs .the risk could be the emplyees in the foreign country since they work not so effective like the employees in the home country .all in all , when you be successful in your life and not want to stand still it is better to take the risks and take the change to things in different way .
