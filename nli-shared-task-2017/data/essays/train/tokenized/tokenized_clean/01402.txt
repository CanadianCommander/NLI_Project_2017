i absolutely agree with that statement .and i do agree because i think that only by taking some risks in life you can make yourself different from other people .i think this for several reasons .fist of all , everyone can do the same things well all life long .but just a few can distinguish themselves .for example , many people in life are happy by doing the same things , all days , all years , all life .but for other people this is a limit .some people in fact ca nt do the same things all life long just because that  s not in their nature .they feel not satisfied by doing a repetitive life .they must change their position .i believe that succesful people are successful because they ca nt do same things all life long .but not only .i believe that successful people love the challenge .challenge is in their nature , and they just can not ignore it .they do nt like to feel like other people so they take risks and try new things .they do these things to prove the world that they are better than other people , that they are special persons .challenge is their life and without challenge theiy are not stimulated and so they feel depressed .so another reason why i believe that successful people take risks is that because they are ambitious .that s not all .there is something more , i belive .and this is the feelig that a person feels when he reaches an high level , for example in work , or anywhere .for example : a man with a normal job in normal city , in a normal and boring coutry , decides to invest his money in a new activity .the activity works good , and the man feels like he is god in person .he changed his life !the feeling is the one that says to them : i made it ! .the adrenaline that you feel is such a good feeling .you feel like you could do everything , if you just wanted .so ambitious people also love that adrenaline shock and the feeling that they prove when they made something important .but taking risk is not always an open highway .tat-s a difficult path to walk on , but if you have got the ability , the intelligence and a little luck it will problably wok .to sum up i think that succesful people love the challenge , love to feel good with themselves and love to say : i made it !
