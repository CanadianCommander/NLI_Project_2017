successful people do not have to try new things if they are satisfied their succeed .they should improve their successful job rather than try totally new things .of course , they can try new things but there is no promise to get success again .i assume that people could have got success is not so careful to try new job because they have confidence from their success .they do not have any pressere in bad way .they feel that they can do everything they want and get succeess .i will not stop them if they have really good ideas for their project or their projects have some similar points which they had , or they are quite sure they can get successful .acutually , they know how to get succeess and what would be able to go well or bad .this is their own problems so i should not stop or disturb them .however , from my perspective , they should not do that because we really can not get success so often .concentrating to one thing is more effective than trying a lot of things .if they have a lot of categolies to do , they would be so busy and each things can be too simple because they have no time to think about each shops .for example , there is a boss who has macdonald s and h & m .if h & m is very popular and they can get a lot of money from it , who thinks about a new barger of macdonald s ?the boss would think about h & m all the time and they do not really think about macdonald s .of course they can get money from macdonald s but the shop would not be better .for these reasons , i do not think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .they can be a professional people of that .
