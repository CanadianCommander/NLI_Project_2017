when we reading the newspaper in the morning , watching tv or walking along a mall we indirect recognize that the numbers of advertisments increasing .all these advertisments promise that this product will be the best and will makes you successfull and provide you a comfortable life .the question is , if the promises will get real ?short time ago i read an article of an bulb supplier .this brand supplier promised that the bulb which this company produces are have a better quality , a higher lifecycle and the efficency is any percent higher than all competitive products .in order to save energy i trust this ad and bought a lot of these bulbs and i payed more than for a competitor product .i was happy to get a high quality product .a few days later the first bulb was defect .i brougth it not back to the store beacuse it is more expensive to drive to the store .a few day later i met a friend .he told me that he visited the factory which produces these bulbs .he explained that millions of bulbs where produced and the last process of the production is the brand stamp on the glass and the packaging .he explained that the same produced bulb will get different brand or noname stame and will get different packaging boxes .this means that the same produced product , with the same quality and the same effectivity will be sold with a higher brand price and a lower noname price .i checked the different brands and noname products he told me and found out that only the price has a difference .as conclusion of this i will no more trust any advertisments .advertisements are designed to sell products .they promising a lot but not the truth .
