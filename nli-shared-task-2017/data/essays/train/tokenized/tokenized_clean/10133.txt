surely i admit that young people apt to have more power to enjoy their lives and left more time .however i insist that olded poeple enjoy life more than young poeple .there are two reasons for this .they have more experiences and money .first , older people have learned how to enjoy life from their longer period of life .they , of corse , have experiences of love with girl/boyfireinds , which sometimes include faiure to success .older people should know how to belong with their partner .for example , my farther who have many girlfriend before marriage , now , has very good time with my mother because he can lead the partnership effectively and can solve probelms easily .sometimes they go to travel togethet .they look so enjoyful for their lifesecond , since many older people have earned the salarys in companies or their own shop , they tend to have far more money than young peole have , who have not worked yet or have just had a job .avarage revenue of business people after working 30-40 yeas in japan no less than 500 dollars .while almost 0 or someone have debt among young people in particula for students .it make older moreover after retiring their firm oleder pople have pention .people spend money as they like .actually many older retired like topeople consume toys for their grandsons with their pleasure .as these reasons it is apparently true that older people enjoy life far more than young peole .their long-term knowleade and the outcome of their effort in in the wrok places bring them to happy `` second life  with their partner and cute garandsons .
