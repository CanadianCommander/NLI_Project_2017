some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older poeple do .but from my point of view , the opposite is the truth .i think it is hardly for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man .first of all , nowadays few young people are aware the purpose of their lives .it is hard to say that a person could be happy without knowing the purpose of his life .instead , many of them idle their precious time .they do not know what they should care most in their life .older people , on the contrary , know exactly what their purpose are .so they do not care much over other trifles as young people do .they know how to set up a goal and keep chasing it .this is what i envy older people most .one of my cousins spent two years in a colleage and try to find her favorite major .but even now she can not make up her mind because she change her interest so frequently .furthermore , young people are not mature enough to control themselves .so they make more mistakes .many young people do things just out of an impluse , .sometimes it can be dangerous to do things this way .as for older people , most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong .they have their own judgements and they can often do things according to their life experiences .no wonder our young people always need an adult to teach us right from wrong .finally , young people are much easier to give in to temptations , especially in today s society .they are not steady enough to avoid the bad effects of many negative things in our society .but as for older people , they have seen much more than us , so they know when and how to say no to temptations .so , i think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person .but i also believe we young people need guides and we learn how to live and enjoy our lives through mistakes and experiences .as we grow older , we will enjoy our lives better .
