i am agree with this statement .young people are becoming more and more selfish everyday .they are beginning to care about themselves only .there are mainly three important reasons for not giving enough time for their communities ; they have more duty every day , they become to care about themselves only , and degeneration of communities .the first reason why the young people does not help their communities is they have more and more duty every day .if we look at the past times , we see that the life is more simple .people are not have to do lots of work at the same time .but life is becoming more and more complicated everyday .for example , a child began to go to school at three years old , and he keeps to going school at the age of twenty two .maybe he had to work when he is a student .this gives lots of responsibility to the young and so he does not have time for helping other people .the second reason is that they become more selfish compared to the past .nowadays not only young people but everyone seems to be care only themselves .people are aware of the situtation that everyone lives alone and dies alone .but especially youth are more likely to be live alone .this thought causes young people does not care about community problems .the third and final reason is degeneration of communities .nowadays some bad people are using some good people for their needs in society .and so good people start to think that why would i help a person without any reason .the main point is people became to not able to see the purpose of helping other people .thus young people do not spend their time helping to other people .to sum up , nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because of three main reasons .i do not think these are all their fault also the societies are responsible of this situtation .yaoung people are immitating the older people .they are just doing what they have seen .
