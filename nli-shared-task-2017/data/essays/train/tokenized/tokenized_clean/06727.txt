basically i do not agree with this statement .actually , travels with a tour guide are confortable .the reason comprises the following two facts .first , most of tour guides usually know and provide a lot of useful information , such as good places for visiting and viewing , delicious restaurants and dengeours areas .the other reason is that we do not have to care any problems related to speaking foreign languages e.g. reserving hotels , buying tickets or ordering in restaulants .however , guide tours have a serious problem , at least for me : we can not arrange the schedule as we like .tour courses are strictly determined .this implies that we can not take a rest even if we feel very tired , and we have to go to places where we do not want to go .we can not get up late . ..another reason why i do not agree with the statement is that we are not able to have private time due to the group travel .private time is quite a precious for eny situations , especially for travels .we must always go with the group and the tour guide .on the other hand for the private travels , we can go anywhere we want to go , we can have a tea for a rest , we can stay for a long time as we like .if we want to know some useful information , travel information centers will be helpful .we may apply half-day or one-day tours found in the information center .in summary , i prefer private travels .if i need some useful information or some optional tours , i will go to travel information center .
