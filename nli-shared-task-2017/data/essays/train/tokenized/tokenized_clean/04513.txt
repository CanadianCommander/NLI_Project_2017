we often hear the word `` neet  in japan , neet is the person who has only part time jobs or do not have jobs .i have some friends who are neet .they have free time , so they can enjoy life without thinking time or date .now , i am a graduate student .i work for my laboratory from early morning to late at night everyday .i am busy everyday , so i am always thinking that i want to have a rest .for me , i sometimes envy neet s life because they have freedom .however , i do nt think that it is good that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i have 2 reasons .first , young people need a lot of money if they want to enjoy life as older people .but in most case , many young people earn so much money .if they get money from their parents , i think they should not enjoy life as older people .the money that older people use their to enjoy life is earned by themselves .but the money that young people use is not !i think that it is very hard to earn money by themselves .when we realize it , we know the importance of money and we appreciate money .if they use a lot of money without knowing it , it is very dangerous .second , i think that we work so hard when we are young .when we are young , we can move freely .when we are young , it is better that we enjoy only to do things we are young .when we get older , it is hard to move , and they can not get less knowledge than we get .so i think that young people enjoy things we can do only when we are young .for these reason , i disagree with the statement .
