many people who success these days , have underwent many different experiences .espeacially , the ones who are introduced in the news or the internet , is speacial from others .so , i agree with the statement , ` successful people try new things  because they have courage that they would succeed in trying a new task , and try to develop the present .to begin with , the people who have succeeded in their life try new things , since they have a faith in their heart that makes them succeed in a certain part .if they did not have such courage , the successed people would not even have had a chance to change their lives .for example , i have an uncle , who is a mountain climber .since he was in college , my grandmother tried to make him give up his dream , which was being a mountain climber .since it is not that of a famous job , my grandmother tried everything to stop him , even acted if she was ill to make him abdicate in that job .however , my uncle did not give up , and practiced very hard and became a successful mountain climber who teaches students and helps them win contests .moreover , since trying to develop what we have now makes people successful , people should have the chance to try new things .making what other could not think of is a huge step up .for instance , if bill gates did not try to invent microsoft , the society would not have been developed this much .his attempt to develop the human lives also made him repectful and succeed in his life .i think that his courage for such an attempt , which made him through all the way to being a the inventor and the richest people in the world , was the key for his success .to conclude , having risks or trying new tasks is the way to be successful because that person had the courage enough to make it trough .also , since the people who succeed had the mind to make a better world , people should try new things .people should try anything to make oneself succeed in their goals .
