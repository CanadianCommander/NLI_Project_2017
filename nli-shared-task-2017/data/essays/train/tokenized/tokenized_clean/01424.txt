no i do nt think so .because , world population is growing up rapidly .therfore the car user increase in twenty yers .the person who have a opposite view to me might think about increasing of population case something bad to nature .for example , acid rain and greenhouse effection .the gas from the car is one of the biggest reason of air polusion .if these problems get worse in twenty years , it seem to have strict control by the goverment to solve these problem .so it might be decresing the car users .but i think we do nt have to worry about that .because today , there are car which are moved by solar system and natural oraganisum oil .`` purius `` invented by honda is a kind of car uses the solar system to work .it is quite expensive but it must be less expensive in future .and a lot of country try to make oils or gasolines which made from natural thing , so there are much more cars in use in twenty years .i mean the car that is kind to nature and human beings .
