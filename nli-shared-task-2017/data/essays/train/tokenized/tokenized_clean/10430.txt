do you think that your young son can handle at least taking the trash from the street if he saw it ?our children today do not alot of simple things than our fathers and grandfathers used to do it proud .this is becouse many parants do not let thier children to try and experince how it would be for them to help your communities and communities nowadays do not open the chance for young pepole .first of all man y parents do not let thier children to to experiment how it feels good when they help thier communities becouse parents think that helping community is a waste of time .even if the children try to do this kind of things thier punsh them and tell them to concerate on thier studing and forget about this kind of things , therefore even the child has the intention to help his community his parents may let him down .as a resolt tje child willdo the same thing with his children when he grow up .in addition communities are not in the same way they used to be .there are some certin customs that recent communityies think that they like a holy thing , no can talk about it and say his opnion about it .before communities were used to to live anin a way that everyone has his own duty and in sometimes when have ve a festival or something like that .but nowadays these habbits have dissapeared in some way and just egsists in some small comunities who stell do as thier fathers did .so , one of the resons whay young do not help in thier community .in conclusan , i want to say that young people do not do anything worth in thier communities becouse of the parents way to look at this kind of thing and for the community way of looking to young do jops that they think it is not found for people .
