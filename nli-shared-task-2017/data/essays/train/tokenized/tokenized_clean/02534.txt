we might think that young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they want to experience things , to discover things and also because they have the energy and the strength to do it .but is this statement really true ?first of all , we will see that young people enjoy the life more than older people and why .then , in a second part , we will explain why , to some extend , older people know how to enjoy life maybe more than the young .first of all , it is a common idea that young people want to enjoy life as much as they can .why ?because they do not know yet the problems they will have to face during the following years .generally , they follow the famous carpe diem which advises people to live each moment with intensity , as if it was the last day of one s life .young people have the strong need to experience things , to discover , to destroy the boundaries of the parents , of the society . ..for example , they will go to parties when the parents do not agree , or will take risks by travelling to countries where they do not have any acquaintance , just to do it , because it is cool , as they say . ..but , even if they do not have the same physical fitness and strenght , older people also enjoy life , maybe more than the young .indeed , older people have lived , they saw what they needed to see , they lived what they had to live .thanks to their experience of life , they know the good things that provide the real pleasure , the real happiness .they are able to compare and so , to know what really matters in life , the way they can enjoy life as much as possible .for instance , they will appreciate each little moment with their little chidren , with their friends . ..thus , they will enjoy life certainly more than young people .to conclude , i think that the statement which claims that young people enjoy life more than older people do is wrong .i totally disagree with it because i can not accept to think that i have already lived the best things in my life .on the contrary , i think that the best moments in my life will come .to enjoy life , you do not have to do incredible things .i think that to enjoy life , you just have to appreciate all the little good moments with the people you love . ..
