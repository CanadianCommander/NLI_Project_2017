i agree with that it is more inportant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .here are three reasons to support my agreement .the first reason is that the idea is the most important one of everythings .only you know the main idea about it , you can think about more details and ask more questions .furthermore , the concepts are the main body of the lesson or something like that .you should understand the concepts and after that you can learn other information .for example , if a student ca nt understand the idea and concepts of the chapter at accouting class , he does nt know what this chapter talking about .then , he gain nothing on accouting class .the worst thing is that he will fail the class .the second reason is that understanding is more basic than learning .you can learn something after your understanding .for instance , in order to learn how to read , you should to understand what does reading mean .it means you should see the words in the paper and say them .therefore , you must gain the idea and concepts of reading .after understanding those , you can learn other things such as different kind of reading methods and how to read .moreover , when people are talking about reading , the first appear in your brain is the meaning of reading .it is the basic one .the third reason is that ideas and concepts are always put in the front of the book such as outline .you can know what is the author mainly mention about in the book becuase of the ideas and concepts .then , you can read the book from first page to the end and learn the details and facts .generally speaking , it is normal when you read books and learn them .on the whole , you ca nt learn the details and facts without having known about the ideas and concepts .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .sometimes , it is enough for them to know ideas and concepts .there is no need to learn facts .
