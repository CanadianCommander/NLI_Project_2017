yes , i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rather than doing what they already know how to do well .life is rapidly moving , every thing is changing , life tomorrow will definitely be different from today , the wheel of technology is accelerating , communications have overtaken the stars , industrialization has progressed and every aspect of life is developing faster than anyone thought to be .accordingly , our world needs a person who can or even who must meet the demands imposed by it and keep up with the frequent changes taking place .a peson has to try new things and experiences , they can not sit aimlessly and say what i have acquired is enough for me .suppose a physician that completed his studty in 1980s .imagine he has not kept up with the development of medicine and medication since then .i believe that his patients will not recover as quickly as if they were cured by a doctor who always runs after new inventions and discoveries .imagine also an engineer who confines himself in what he had received at school or university .how should he design a new design that reflects today .i doubt he will be able to do so .how can an athlete be successful unless he or she takes risks .how can we find people like schumacher , mohammad ali , michael jorddan and so on whose contributions in life are great and without their risk taking life would be tasteless .life must go on and go forward , the wheel of progress must run all the time , we need more and more people who open the door wider into new experiences and new adventures , hence new life that is completely different from those whose life is always full of monotony .
