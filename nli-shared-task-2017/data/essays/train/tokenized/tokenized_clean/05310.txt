there are a lot of advertisments in society , and i often see them .i like seeing them , so i agree with the follwing statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .i have some reasons .first of all , it is often possible for most advertisments to make products seem much better than they really are because they often have a lot of coments and pictures .for example , a lot of advertisements have many user s coments , and they also have a lot of pictures .the a lot of coments and pictures influence on readers .if advertisement has nice coments and pictures , the goods is bought by a lot of people .second , the advertisements having a lot of pictures and coments can make reader happy .for example , if you see advertisements which do not have advertisements , you maybe think the advertisements is very boring .but , most advertisements have a lot of pictures and coments , so you can enjoy seeing the advertisements .therefore , you feel that most advertisements is very good , even if the advertisements is not better than they really are .for these reasons , i think that i disagree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
