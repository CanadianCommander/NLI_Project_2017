this statement seems like a biblical rivelation , but can be true if we considere only our europe .if i see the past , really , i see that in the last thirty years we have had at first a rapid , after more costant , growth of the number of cars in general .really , the growth of cars can be interpretated by the development of our europen society .of course , this growth has token with its other problems , like the pollution , or the growth of the price of oil .so , in europen and american cities , i think that there will be a slow decline of the use of car , caused by new laws against car - use and its pollution , or by the encrease of price of the fuel , or by the oblish ( i hope !!! )of the use of pubblic trasport in the centre of our cities .for this reasons , in europe , i think that the statement will be true .altough , if we see the world , it is sure that the total number of cars will grow : some nations , like china , or india , or brazil , are becoming modern nation , and people of these areas , will want to have a car like us .in fact , a good part of this people , that is migrating to the city , will have a better input of money and will be able to take a car .so , this fact will cause new pollution for these countries , and until the governments will not make new laws , it will have a growth .so , in conclusion , with a global vision .i am disagreed with the statement , and i think that the situation can only become more negative .we must catch a solution not for cars , but for pollution , and with the reserch to create a car with hydrogen like fuel , we will live better with more cars .
