school is a very important social structure where students can form their minds thanks to the information given by teachers .usually teachers believe that the exposition of facts is the most important part of what is called `` didactic  .they expect pupils to learn the facts and to repeat them exactly in the same way the teacher taught them .this clealy creates a kind of disfunction of learning in the student who has to learn mere facts .according to me the best way to improve both teaching and learning is the use of facts as the material support of a new element : the elaboration of ideas and concepts deriving from those facts .obviously it is also important to learn , sometimes also by heart , some specific facts , but what does matter is the ability to search and to find the sense of a fact .people usually believe that learning facts is more important than elaborate them because people suppose that those facts carry the so called `` truth  .unfortunately the truth is not given one time forever , truth depends on who is speaking , namely thinking .the mere exposition of facts is not a guarantee of truth .students should learn that ideas are more important than facts : for example is more important to understand the deep reasons that caused the two world wars rather then the day in which they started .it is clear that also the historical facts are important but they are senseless without a specific interpretation and knowledge of the ideas .ideas and concepts are what move the world , they are at the basis of what we define ideology .every society is based on a specific ideology which is , properly , the melting pot of the ideas and of the concepts that created that specific society .
