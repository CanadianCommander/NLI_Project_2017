i agree yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i am going to cover my opinion about it .i think it occur specially city side compare to country side .i am going to explain covering some exampls .in country side , they work as a farmers in huge farm .they have to coorporate each other managing agriculture in their farm .so they would participated in their community automatically .now however , contrast city side , they may not know about neiborhood even they can not know their name .because they do not need cooporate each other to live .their parents just work and manage their family in a day .if young people have to give enough time to help their communities , i think that their parents or around thier adults teach how to join , help or cooporate together .because yong people does not know how to join or help their communities same as around adult not to join it .and their parents or their around adults have to consider something hold festival or event that young people will have more intersted in thier own communities .then if young people is interested in thier communities , i think they would became to consider join or help thier communities .i coverd i agree yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .because young people deos not need to join their communities generally that they live .but if they more help together , thier aound enviroment would be changed lik
