it s easier to learn facts than understand the ideas and concepts which generate them .while some students may think it s more important to understand ideas ; others prefer focusing only on facts .in my opinion , it s worth it to try to deal with ideas and concepts .ideas and concepts allow us to understand the reasons of what happen in our world .facts are only a result of something and never provide enough information .when a student focus on ideas and concepts , he will understand much easier new events .in my opinion , focusing on facts is too restrictive and does nt provide any new abilities .when i was litlle , my physic teacher was always explaining us the reason why something happen .it was hard in the beginning but i developed the will to work in a research department .the last but not least , it s just more interesting to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .when we learn facts we probably do nt understand the meaning of the event .students who are lazy will choose to learn facts without understanding the concept around .i have always thought it is pretty borring to try to remember by heart something because i just do nt understand .i did it when i was in history class .i tried to remember everything and just gave it to my teacher during the exam .when i begin to understand ideas and concepts behind those facts , i was able to learn more information .in conclusion , it seems obvious that it s more worth it for students to deal with ideas and concepts than it s for them to learn facts .the opportunity to provide more abilities in understanding others subjects and the interest to be able to learn more are two main reasons .
