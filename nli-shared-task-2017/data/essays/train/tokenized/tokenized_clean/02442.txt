typically , it is a common misconception that young people would enjoy life more than older people do .it is infact true that younger people have more potential to enjoy life , although it is the sad truth that some do not .some of the more older people in the world probably enjoy life much more than younger people .i believe that with the right mindset , enjoying life is not a matter of age .younger people have more capable bodies to play sports or do very difficult activities , such as mountain climbing .a child at the age of five would not have many worries with almost no responsability .they would continue running around , thinking of nothing but their next desire .a teenager would exhibit realizations of responsability .they would have to keep up with their grades , and their social life , etc .although , a teenager still does not have a goal set for their life .some have a theory that they have the so-called `` teen angst  in which they rebel against many different situations and/or persons in their life .this is an example of how a younger person may not enjoy life more than an older person does .an older person should be wise enough to do the right thing and act the right way .another example could be if a person was put into a very bad situation .for instance , if the teenager or child was living in the more disease prone areas of africa .they probably would not be having so much fun , especially with the political instability and the little amount of food around .an older person , on the other hand , usually has a foot in the direction they would want to follow .they would not have the ability to , for instance play ninty minutes of soccer in one of the major clubs of the world , although they could still enjoy such past-times as golf .an older person would probably have had the resources set around himself/herself to be in some way succesfull .it is up to them whether they want to follow that path or any other .in conclusion , it is only ourselves limiting the enjoyment of life .it is true , with some situations , there really is not much you could do , although we have to make the best of what we have .so once again , it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .
