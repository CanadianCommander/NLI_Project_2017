this essay refers to the question whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of the following reasons :the first reason is that advertisements show only the advantages of the products and ignore the disadvantages .you do not get complete information about the product , about special conditions and tariffs and about the possibilities of use .very often you realize the disadvantages of the products after the act of purchasing and you are disappointed that you can not use the product in the way you planned it .the second reason is that advertisements make you think that the advertised product is the best product you can have in this area or subject .but you do not know if this is the truth because the advertisment does not show you a comparison of prices and features of the advertised product and the competitor s product .the aim of advertisements is to make you buy products without thinking and without comparing features and prices .in my opinion , this aim and this way to sell products violates the principle of self-determination and is morally wrong .the third reason is that advertisements give you sometimes the feeling that you unconditionally need the product which the advertisement is for - even if you have never thought of this product before and you do not really need it .the advertisements can produce strong wishes to buy things , but people are not aware that their wish ist caused by advertismenet .the advertisements try by this method to increase consum and profits for the producing company , but very often you make unnecessary purchases and expenditures because you use the advertised products only once .the last reason why i think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that they are often adressed to children .children mostly do not understand the value of money and do not think about the quality of an advertised product .they just want to have it and ask their parents for this product as long as the parents decide to buy it .in many cases the parents do not spend any thoughts about quality and price because they want to make their children happy and accepted in the community of other children .so it is much easier to sell products with low quality if you adress children with the right advertisement .so in conclusion i believe because of the mentioned reasons that advertisements make products seem much better and useful than they really are .
