i disagree with it , because it s also a sort of lying to their customers .i understand that they are trying to sell their products alot , but they have to think about their customer to not be disappointed .i really enjoy watching tv , and there are lots of advertisements during the show break .watching those advertisements make me laugh , because i know that things will never happen .few years ago , i saw an advertisement of a hair shampoo on tv , so i decided to try that because i thought my hair would be like the models on tv .i bought that shampoo , and tried .on the first day , i did not see any difference , so i though it takes a while to be silky .i waited .nothing happened .that shampoo was same as the other products .not one thing was different or special except the nice smell .i ve been using it for few years now , but still , nothing seems to happen .they are really trying hard to grap people s attention , but advertising to trick people is not good .some people will not care much , but some people can be serious .when they advertise , they have to think about their customers  feeling , or make their products like it is on the advertisement .
