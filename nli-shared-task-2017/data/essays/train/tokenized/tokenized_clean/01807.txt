we live in a world which is very interesting and contains plenty of knowledge .is nt fair to say which one is better for us , either in having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or be a specialized in one specific subject .i beleive we should have knowledge of many subjects and be a specialized in any one subject to which we feel that suits us .let us have examples , as we are in our school we are taught to different subjects like mathematics , life sciences , social studies .as we grow up to university level , we are given a chance to choose what we are interested in like medicine , engineering , business administration , music , law etc .so i beleive we should have enough knowledge in all aspects of life .if i beleive in having broad knowledge of many subjects rather than be a specialized , then it is highly impossible for me to remember the things .for example a doctor ca nt be a lawyer because the medicine knowledge is endless where as the lawyer has to remember all the laws and he has to upgrade himself with change in government and in `` law and order  .so a person cant be specialized in many subjects .let us say i beleive in second point of being a specialized in one subject rather than have enough knowledge in various subjects . ..suppose i am secialized in business administration and if someone asks me about the business i am able to answer to all of their questions and if one day someone asks me anything irrelevent to my subject of business i may not be able to answer the question .if we take an example of sports , we often have interest in many sports but we love only one sport .thats why an football commentator can not do commentary in badminton because he may not be knowing of the rules correctly .learn the good things as much as we can whether it may be from a scholar or from a small kid because learning never ends .
