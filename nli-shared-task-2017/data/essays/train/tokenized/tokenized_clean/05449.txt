despite the fact that there are numerous cars running on the streets nowadays , i think the number of cars in use will start to decrease in the twenty years to come .there will just be fewer of them due to the following two reasons : less birth and more advanced technology .currently there seems to be a trend for people to give less deliveries of babies , thus reducing the population , which altogether would also cut down the amount of people using cars .with fewer birth rates , there comes less population on earth .these two are tightly inter-connected .take one family , for example , who want to go on a family trip togethere .when the number of family members drop , relatively there would also be fewer chances for that family to take on cars as their vehicle for the trip .if such be applied to every other family on earth , there will be an apparent decrease in the amount of cars in use as a result .another possible explanation for the decrease of cars is the advancement in technology .as the years go by , the technology is enhacing and improving at a very rapid rate .complex inventions such as cars that involve the application of high tech were introduced to the world , enabling the possibility of moving freely from one place to anothe .it is then very likely to conclude that in the years to come , other alternative ways of transportation might also be created and developed .in that case , it wo nt be necessary for us to travel through cars , but via other motor vehicles instead as the alternate ways .the advancement of technologies as well as reduce on the birth rate are taking place even at this very moment .they can have various impacts to our society , fewer car in use being one of the effects that they will bring .with these two factors involved , it can be thus expected that , in twenty years to come , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
