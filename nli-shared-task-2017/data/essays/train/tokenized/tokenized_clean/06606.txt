success is the word that one can achieve after lot of hard work done with the appropriate steps taken at right time .not only that , one would to getting the knowledge and realize the things that helped one to be successful .successful people tend to use there new ideas and hence making them to try new ideas with confidence .one would be setting new things in their path once they are successful already in the field areas they wanted .they may be risk in trying the new things but they would be quick enough to pull out the profits out of it .for example lets take reliance industry in india which has expanded its busniess in all the areas let it be mobiles , petroleum , etc .they have tried to put new things for there brand company .they took risk initially and they are successful in implementing there business right now .one should be innovative in thinking and would rather try to be successful in new things which they has ever tried before .successful person would put his startegies , budget , ideas behind implementing them , how would they be helpful to each and every person in mind before practice it .as they are already know how to do well they would be trying to simulate the methods they have tried to make it a success to the new things they are trying to emerge .it would be good practice for succesful person to implement his ideas in new things and would help if they would be any crisis in the thin gthey are already doing well .as they are already through the different stages that one would be going through when they start new things , successful people would be able to handle the consequences when they are risks attched to it .may be initially it would take time for a new implemention to gain profits or lower risks but later on it would be fruitful .they would be visualizing the future of the new thing that they will be going to implement beforehand .not but not the least one would be taking the pros and cons of the new things they would be trying .i think successful people are the one who could afford to take the risk to start a new thing rather than any ordinary person .in anyway there would be no development ecoomically if one stick to the thing they already done .i would definitely agree that a successful people should try new things and take risks rather than doing the things they already did well .
