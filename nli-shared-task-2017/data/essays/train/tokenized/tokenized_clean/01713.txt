i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will fewer cars in use than there are today .as cars become cheaper , safer and more user-friendly , more people will choose cars as their main means of transportation .some people may argue that technological advances in telecommunications may reduce the need for transportation .i think that , while it is true that there has already been a general decrease in business trips , the use of cars for private transportation will continue to increase in the future .others may argue that more efficient public transportation will render cars obsolete .however , i believe that although public transportation is a key factor in development , it will never substitute cars because of its inherent limitations .the cost of producing a car has been greatly reduced in recent years whereas their convenience and performance continues to increase .nowadays fully equiped cars such as the renault logan or the subaru pleo cost around three thousand dollars to produce and are sold for aroudn five thousand .another important factor is the rapid growth of the automotive markets in developing countries such as india , china or brazil .in these countries still relatively few people own a car but there is a great potential for growth .in china , for example , last year saw a twenty percent increase in units sold .following this trend , many car manufacturers are launching low cost bric ( which stands for brazil , russia , india , china ) product lines designed to meet these market s demands .in conclusion , although it is true that the use of cars may be reduced in specific situations , i believe that in general the number of cars will continue increasing .
