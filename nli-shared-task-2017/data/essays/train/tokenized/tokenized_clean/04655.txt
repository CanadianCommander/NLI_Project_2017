in my opinion , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than just specializing in one specific subject provides many advantages .transfering the knowledge of one academic subject to another can often simplify life .good knowledges of mathematics , for example , help in various other academic subjects like business , econonimics , physics , etc .other than that , being well educated in many subjects means that you do not rely on other people as much .you have the knowledge ( `` power  ) to decide by yourself what is right or wrong ( at least in your opinion )having a broad knowledge in many subjects also keeps you away from being a coach potatoe .if you show your interest in many areas you will see that there are connections that might be exciting .then you want to learn more about it , you would to understand how things are working .your brain keeps being used .in this way you are not just satisfied by knowing that your good at one topic and just leave the other topics unregarded behind .look at senior citizens .many older people that are still interested in many topics also show good physically health .our society is changing from a industrial oriented to a more service oriented one .this implies changes in the job sector .jobs in the past will not be needed to be done in the future .but - going with this - new jobs will be created in fields that we ca nt think of at the moment .if you just have knowledge in one specific subject rather than in several ones it might get really difficult for you to find a good , satisfying job .companies are looking for people that show a big interest in a variety of topics .they believe that a broad knowledge helps new employees to easily adapt to their new task at the company .often , scientist are hired in the business world because they are believed to think in a more logical , structed way .all in all , specializing in one topic is not completely wrong .but having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects truly enriches and simplifies life .
