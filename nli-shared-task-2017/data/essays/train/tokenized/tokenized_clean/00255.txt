as i m doing engineering studies , the question of take my courses on one specific subject or on many various themas occured to me several times .my choices follow the way of a broad knowledge , excepted the last year : i prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year .so why ?the first reason is that studies in diverse academic subjects give you a large view of how take a problem when it occurs .you can have many ways to develop a solution which could respond to your problem .if you studied only one subject , your mind is focused on one method which could finish in a dead end .for example in microelectronics , a friend of mine proposed a solution using his knowledges in mechanics !another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in .history , geography , economy , physics , mathematics , and languages are essential to see follow our changing environment every days , not only at home , but also when we re working .for instance , social sciences could help you to understand why your boss is in a bad mood today , and maybe learn you not to ask him some things which could be desastrous . ..my last argument for broad knowledge would be your abilities you can have to change of job , or decrease your time of adaptation when you enter a new firm .nevertheless , the specialization is - i think - also very important .it will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume , when you apply for your first job .moreover it is interesting when you study to keep time to make a deep analysis on subjects you prefer .it will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter .eventually , as i want to have some managerial responsabilities , i choose to diversify my studies .
