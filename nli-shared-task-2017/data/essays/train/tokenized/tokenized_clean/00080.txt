i agree this statement .young people does think about their problem .because their parents always solved their problem .also , they did not afraid anything .they don ; t think about result .they enjoy it and tha s all .that was kind of unresposible , but they really do nt know about everything .people said when they were young they have a passion .so try everthing what they can .so they tried and sometimes faill but some times succeed .imporant thing of this thought is they always tried enjoy their life better than oldert people .so usually young people enjoy their life more than older do .people getting older and they needed to responsable to their life .so , even though they wanted to try , but they ca nt .because they already know that will be dangerous and affect other people .so , they can not enjoy their life .also , they are too busy .they needed to do plenty of things .they think about work , relationship and housework .etc .so they could not enjoy their life to do something .young people have mor time than older people and they care about only few things .they can do everthing what they want only reason they are young they are not afraid about anything .if you ask to people about their best life , most of people answered when they were young .and they wanted to go back that time .they said that time they really enjoy their life and did what every they want .so , this answer showed young people enjoy thier life more than older do .i think i agree this opinion because i am young .but , usually young people enjoy it and happy about their life more than older people .
