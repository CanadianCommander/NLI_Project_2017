as far as i am concerned , i neither agree or disagree with the statement above .so far , both considered approaches are okay to me .it depends on different aspects , which way is much better .i am going to describe some aspects and some base information , how everyone should decide in terms of `` broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects  versus `` specialize in one subject  .at first , everbody should make sure , what kind of future career aspirations they tend to have .therefore , you should ask yourself the following two questions :- do you want to become an expert in one specific subject or knowledge area ?- or do you prefere to become a generalist ( person , who knows many different things about different subjects - but majorly on a high level basis ) over some different subjects without a deep knowledge in details ?if people are able to answer these questions , it should be quite straight-forward to find a solution on an individual basis .if you want to become an expert in a specific area , you should focus on one or perhaps even two ( but not more ! )subjects and drive yourself into an expert role among your peers over the years of study .if you want to become a generalisit , you should study several subjects to approach a wide horizont of knowlege .unfortunately , at the beginning of a study , many students are unsure what directions they should prefere .in this situation , i am going to recommend to make following choice : as long as students are able to keep the generalist role without the need for specializing , students should try to get into different acadamic subjects in order to find out , what is the best approach for each of them .if students are going to choose this way , they have to be aware about time management .if students tend just `` to study around  plus loosing time and no learning plan , they are going to have a disadvantage during application for a job .recruiting departments of companies ask applicants about the length of their study time .if there is an answer with no target direction , it is very hard to get a job .
