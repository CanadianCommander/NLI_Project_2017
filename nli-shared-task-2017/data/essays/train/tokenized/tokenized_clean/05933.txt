in my perspective , i believe that the number of cars will be reduced in twenty years from today .at first , the petrolleum crisis will affect directly on the production of cars .because it has been estimated that the world will run out of petrolleum in twenty years from now .that s why the world have to find another source of energy instead .recently , the scientist have invented a car which run on the hydrogenic energy .however , it s not as efficient as the petrolleum , also they found it more expensive than the petrolleum .secondly , the environmental crisis that the cars made from its exhausts .the environmental associations will not be satisfied about what s happening .they will force cars manufactures to reduce there production of cars in reason of what environmental threats caused by cars exhausts .furthermore , i think that the mechanical energy will be the most common after twenty years from now .it s not that worthy for ordinary people , and it will be common used instead of cars .thus , that s why i am totally agree with the statement that says : `` in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today
