i agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities .i believe from personal observation and experience that social service has much lesser importance amongst the youth of today than what it should ideally be having .young people do not seem to think that community service should be an integral part of their lives .this is unfortunate , because social service has profound impact both on the individual and community levels .social service builds personal character , promotes community spirit and develops respondibility in a person .hence it is essential for the overall growth and development of the person .community service is essential for a functioning society - it promotes the general well-being of the society , encourages responsibility division and delegation and greatly enhances the integration of the community .one only needs to look around to find examples of youngsters neglecting their societial duties and responsibilities .they are more busy admiring and aping transient entertainment and fashion icons .these ` icons  of today do nothing to instill social responsibility amongst their fans .a life of hedonism is considered ` cool  and seems to be the trend to follow for the youngsters .they do not have enough concern about the welfare of the underprivileged , or the elderly .they are unaware of pressing issues that their society faces .even in my own community - which places immense value on giving respect to elders - i have seen young people ignore the plight of their own parents and grandparents .it is essential that the reasons for the greatly reducing sense of social responsibility amongst the youth be identified and remedial measures taken .it should be instilled amongst them that as a part of society people have duties and responsibilities which simply can not be shirked .parents and teachers must take care to instill the values of social service in children from and early age , and must themselves prove to be good role models .schools must regularly provide social service and community ethics courses , and atleast a few of them could be made mandatory .in conclusion , i would like to reitierate the point that the lack of social commitment and responsibility amongst the youth is a trend that is detrimental to both the individual and society .it is imperative that proper measures be taken to reverse this trend and to make our youth more socially responsible again .
