there are a lot of responsibilities on the young peoples shoulders .they are trying to discover themselves , discover their abilities , their place in the communuty eventually draw their own path .i believe eventhough i spend most of my time for studying , i give time to helping my community .is it enough ?i think this statement is both true and not true for different reasons .it is true in a way that we do nt do our best .we can spend a lot more time to make our city a better place .we can take part actively in regualtions .also we can spend more time with the elderly .we can do this by carefully planiong our spare times .but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends whan we have time .one of the reasons for tghis is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before .almost everything in out lives can be done with professionals .because of this people less intefere to eachpothers lifes .on the other hand its true that we are doing what ever we can .even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the communuty .i do not have time but when i see my neighbours i ask them if they need something .i am living in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters .i ask to them if they need anything when i am going to the market or example .if something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes , i interfere and help .if i am not aware what can i do about it ?i think this sentence is both tur and not true from different views .it is true that young people might be little bit isolated from community and because of this they are nto helping much .but youngs , especially students are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be balmed for not giving enough time .it is communuties responsiblity to create the occasions for sharing and helping .
