yes , i agree with the given statement .successful people try to do the new things rather than doing old things or repeated things .here successful people means the people who got a lot of experience in their job or in their personal problems .doing the repeated things didnot give the new ideas and we also do nt get new knowledge .rather doing the new things we get the many ideas and these ideas can be used in many of situations .but old things are also important for begining of a new thing .this means that repeated things are fundamentals or basics of begining new things .so we ignore the old things in some cases not in all .suppose if we neglect the old ideas for starting a new one , some times new things becomes failed .so we have to take care while doing new things .these are some disadvantages for not taking the old ideas .repetition of things is a bad idea .inorder to improve our intellectuval abilities we have to improve the new ideas .once we find the new things and new ideas the organization or anyother criteria where we are working gives awards and also gives the better position than now you are working and also a good salary .by doing new things we have to discover many things , these will be helpful for the future use .once we find new idea it will be useful for many generations and our name be printed in many books .if we do nt get proper reponse at the time of inventing the new things , prosperous name will come after centuries or decades .so according to me finding the new ones is great rather than old ones .these are some advantages of getting to do new things and new ideas .
