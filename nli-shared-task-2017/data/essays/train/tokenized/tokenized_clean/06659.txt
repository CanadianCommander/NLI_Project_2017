life was a box of chocolate , you ll never know what you are going to get .yes , i start my essay with this famous sentance .i always consider life is a period of unexpecting experience .no matter we like the situation you re in or not , we should accept it ; no matter we were young or old , we could not escape any of those experience .my point of view is that we could enjoy it , with a grateful heart , seriously and hopefully .when i was young , i begun to learn dance when i was four .i should practice everyday after class .i not only received numorous awards in dancing competition , but also gain much more joyful compared to my peers .i have a vivid childhood .when i grow up gradually , i still like my life full of colorful experience .i never give up attampt different kinds of things , either for entertainment or for serious academic subjects .my interdicipline research includes economics , journalism and political science , much more broader and deeper than others .i m content with my life pattern , i believe i enjoy my life more than the generation older than me , such as my parents .my parents was almost fifty years old now .i was always believing that they were busy working everyday , all of theire concern is earning our family a much better life , competing with others , and so on .but things change when i begun to oberserve them more carefully , i begun to doubte myself , does young people really enjoy life more than older people do ?i found although they are becoming older and older everyday , and they still have their own work to do now , they go to park every evening after dinner , contiuning for twenty years .you could not imagine how beautiful that picture are --- at that very moment when they are walking together , talking and smiling , it is the happiness .yes , walking together in the park , for several years .it s quite simple , but i believe for them , it s the joy of life .as i stated previously , no matter we were young or old , enjoy life with a grateful heart is my own choice .all of us could enjoy life well .
