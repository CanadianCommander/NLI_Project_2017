each day , numerous new products are welcomed by the market and the need to promote a specific item among these huge inflation of consumption attractions stimulated advertisement sector to be one of the most fast growing sector of the econopmic system .keeping in mind that the main role of advertisements is to make products look much better in order to sell more , i agree very much with the idea that advertisement might sometimes lie for some eligible reasons .first of all , one should remember which context we are talking about .it is highly developed capitalist society , where consumption has become in such an intrinsic way that the competitiveness within the market is incredible , nevertheless the products have more or less same quality .therefore , it is indispensible for advertisement to make products seem more valuable than they really are in order to look like making a difference .obviously , we all imagine that this new kind of toothpaste that we watched on tv would not be so different from the previous type that we use every day .or prepaid soup does never look as delicious as appears on tv nor does it taste any better from my mother s natural recipe .although i understand the reasons why advertisements might be mistaken , i contend that some of the advertisements go as far as violating customer s rights .for instance , most of the time the long advertisements on fitness equipments present the product as the most efficient one ever existed on earth and the ads also relies on the former customers  testimonials in order to assure new ones .i regret to say that most of time , these people recommending the products happen to be amateur actors , not happy customers .this is an example where innocent people s time , money and energy is exploited .i remember my mother once buying such a product and realized how worthless it was .to conclude , i would like to call people to be more careful about advertisements and never forget what they are seking for .i guess this difficult situation is the inevitable kind of life provided by cunsumer society .
