although advertisement is a rather effective and influencial way to increase the sell of products in our modern society i agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  for the following reasons :there is a hidden economical stategy behind advertisement : the goal to attract as much people as possible in order to make the largest amount of money at the same time , since every company or enterprise wants to profit most from money spent by customers for the goods offered .hence there is competition on the market which advertisments for the goods of every producing company is effective for , pretending that the goods of these or those companies are the best ones .a further argument for my point of view is that advertisements for products are not necessary by engendering illusions out of reality since in former centuries marketing which advertisement is a part of not even existed so people only praised the goods by talking to each other about it .the goods were always in great demand and had to be produced since wars occured all over the world much more than nowadays destroying agricultur and economic structures again and again .modern technology was also missing which brings me to the next point .today we have this technology to produce greater and greater masses of products for people which are in longer periods of peace than in the past so advertisement becomes important to still get a profit or even the maximum of profits from the shrink of the urgent need of products in order to survive .people must by all means be influenced by advertising campaigns in order to still get attracted in some way of the already long existing production of products of all kinds .there is no urgent use in order to survive in our western civilized countries .it occurs very often that i watch television or read a newspaper or journal were advertisements for several products are presented .sometimes i decide to buy a product but initially when i test it i become aware of the ordinary use or taste of the product that i already know for years which has not developed to a considerable positive and different extend .so generally to me advertisement is manipulation of people for products that already exist in our everyday life or new products like cell-phones with many new options that are not really necessary for us to survive and they are even harmless .
