every generation is criticized by the ones immediately before .it s natural and i m not surprised about that , but the fact is that i simply do nt agree with statements so general that involve such a huge category of people as `` young people nowadays  , because it s impossible to me to group in only one category a so large number of individuals as `` young people  are .anyway , beside the fact that this sentence sounds somehow more as a common-place than as a deeply analyzed statement , i do nt agree with it in details too .i m going to explain myself .there are various ways to help one s own community , and i know some people involved in those activities and i am too , someway .when i was at liceo , a lot of classmates of mine used to be a part of a catholic association whose purpose was to help elderly people .every sunday they used to visit some old people and play charts or other games with them , giving them joy and happines .i think that this would be a clear example of the fact that young people usually help their communities , even if most people does nt always recognize it .moreover , as i ve always liked dealing with children , i spend some of my spare time helping kids who have problems in school-subjects , and that is the way i usually help my community , i.e. in the way the most fits me .i could number and write about plenty of other young people helping their own community , but i think it would be useless : the most important thing is that i strongly believe that sentences like that are just nonsense , as you can find some young people that never help people around them but also some others deeply involved in providing various kinds of help to their community .nonetheless i strongly believe that it would be better if more people helped their community , but i do nt think that this is due to the fact that young people are worse than adults , but to the fact that there is always a need for help , and there will always be .my opinion , indeed , is that young people nowadays are not so worse than young people of previous generations : the just behave in their own way .
