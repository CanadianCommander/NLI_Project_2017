i agree with the statement bacause , according to me , the new technologies will allow people to improve the quality of public transport .thanks to this travelling will be faster and will have less impact on the environment .nowadays cities are full with cars and this is not just an environmental problem but olso an economical one .in my opinion tramcars and alternatives means should be preferred to couches because they need , to be supplied , energy and not with oil .maybe in the future people will use their bicycles to move for short distances and trains or planes if they have to cover long distances .but it is only an idea .if the nowadays rate of smog keeps growing , as scientist warn , people will realise that we have gone too far an then we will use our cars only when we are obliged to do it .to make it feasible the government should give much more money to the transport sector so that people will use public transport as much as possible .this prblem is particularly evident in italy where the public means of transport are dirty , always late and always full of people : in addiction to that , the ticket is too high if compared to the service provided .so i hope that in twenty time the sector of public transport will be better and that the number of cars will be reduced .one of the big issues of these years is that of oil and its price that is growing higher and higher , that is why i prefer walking or take my bicycle to go to the city center .this is a way to see the city from another point of view .in the past fifty years it has skyrocketed and people can not afford it anymore : so something must change .maybe that of mine is a too optimistic vision but i really hope that the most powerful men in the world will understand the gravity of the situation and react promoving alternatives means in to opposition car .
