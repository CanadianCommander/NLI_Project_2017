what kind of people do you like ?in my case , i tend to be interested in the people who try new things and take risk .i think that i also like the people who is doing only same things to know how to do well , however i really like the people who try new things .therefore i agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first of all , i really like challengers for new things , because i think that challengers will give me a comfortable life .for example , when i lived in japan , i often watched a tv program which is some people try to invent new technologies .i love the tv program , because some inventors had been studied some difficult new technologies , finally they invented the technologies , for example , dvd , microchips and so on .thanks to the invents , our lives are getting better than before .if the inventors had nt tried that invents , our lives would have nt been convenient .therefore i think that such people are very important .moreover , i really think that a challenge spirit will give us encouragement .for example , when i worked for a bank , there is a very good salesman in the bank .he was very famous for a loan officer , and then he often got the best sales award .however , one day he suddenly quit our bank , and he established a business consaltant company .many bankers in our bank were surprised , because if he continued to work the bank , he would be a president .however he quit .he said that he wants to try new own business without our bank s name value .after he quit our bank , i was really encouraged from him .as a result i also quit the bank , and i tried to get an mba in the usa .even though we are doing very well , i really think that challenge spirit is very important for our lives and our mental .if we did nt try new things , our lives would nt improve and our own ability and possibility would nt broad .i think that even if we take a risk , we should try something .therefore i agree wiht the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing well .
