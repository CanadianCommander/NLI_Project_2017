there are many people understand ideas and concepts but they do nt know what they are .the student have to do what they are from doing to learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts for students .here are some reasons to support my idea .first of all , there is a soccer ball .everyone knows what to do with the ball .if there is two people that person awho has naver played soccer ; however knows the soccer ball very well , and person b has experiences to play soccer but , he does nt really know about the ball .person b knows about a soccer ball because he has learned facts to play .person a knows about the ball ; however , he does nt know how to play because he only has ideas .second of all , there is a blind , and he understand to play soccer .however , he has never seen it and played .the blind has ideas ; however , the ideas is not worth because he has naver done .to do what he thinks will make the blind to learn playing soccer .third of all , there are students in the classroom and a professor is giving a lecture .the professor makes students understand ideas and concepts ; however , the students do nt know what they are because of no experiences from the ideas .finally , there is a korean adverb which is `` to do once is better than to listen to ideas .according to the adverb , even if a person had ideas , there would be nothing before doing things .therefore , he will learn what the ideas are .in conclusion , i believe that to learn facts is better than to understand ideas and concepts .i m writing an essey with learning facts .if i only understood the ideas of writing , i would never write anything .
