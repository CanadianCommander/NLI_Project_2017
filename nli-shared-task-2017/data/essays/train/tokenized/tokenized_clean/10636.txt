in our life we always see that some people keep success and others not .i think that it does nt depends only on the fact that a person take risk or not .so i can say that sometimes a person keep success because of their risks and sometimes becauses of his good luck .in the first case , the person is a very known and eximated person .for instance , a person that has people that work for him can be a man that taked risks , that believed in his ability and in his potentiality , that have a great sense of responsability because perhaps the future of many family depends on his decisions .in the second case i can think to some people that now appear on television , or in the cinema .they are successful people but their success is not keep from hard work .they had simply a good luck in order to be known and to receive a lot of money and often the success is no so long .for instance the famous people s sons are successful people but they have nt take any risk : they are only famous people sons .to conclude , successful people can take risks or can have a good luck rathen the others .
