i agree with the statement that it s better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .when we look around us , we can easily see that people we define as `` successful  are generally the ones who have and eclectic knowledge on subjects .as a high school senior who is in the process of apllying to colleges , i ve realized the importance of being a well-rounded person even .colleges do nt just want kids who have great sat verbal scores ; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test as well .if you want to guarantee your spot in the admissions , you better be ready to take a shot on the sat subject test .the people who earn the most money , according to some surveys , are bio-medical enginners .have you ever thought why ?they not specialize on medical subjects but also are experts on engineering .or even doctors .it s not enough for them to specialize on biology , or anatomy ; they have to learn a wide range of subjects of they want to become successful in their professions .also if you have a wider knowledge on things , you can have more options to choose from in your life .the human brain never fails to amaze me .i ve experienced that as you put more knowledge into your brain , it just starts wanting to absorb more and more knowledge .it never gets enough .even if one believes that specializing in one specific subject is better , they should start by trying to gain a broad knowlede on things , because it will make it easier for their brain to understand .everything happening in this world is related to another somehow .it is hard to specialize in physics , for example , if you do nt have much of a knowledge in mathematics ; which makes me start to think that it is `` necessary  to have a broad knowledge of many subjects `` even if  you want to specialize in one subject .
