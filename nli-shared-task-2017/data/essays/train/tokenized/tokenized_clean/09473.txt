this question is really important not only for people who are planning and starting studies at a college or university but also for people already working in a specific area .in my eyes you should specialize in a specific subject as soon as possible .there are a lot of academic areas you can study so at first you have to identify that one that fits best to your personal interests .when you are intersted in maths for example it does not make a lot of sense to study literature .so at that point you have to make the first specialization .in my eyes that will help you to succeed in your studies because you are learning something about topics you are really interested in .after finishing studies the process of specialization continues .when you have studied business for example i think it does not make a lot of sense to search a job where you have to apply the whole knowledge you have collected during your studies .you will lack the propper knowledge to perform difficult tasks which will lead to failure and in the worst case you will loose your job .therefore i think after finishing business studies for example you have to specialize again an maybe search for a job in the marketing or controlling departement of a company .even when you now work in a specific area , the process of specializing should still continue .to become a successful employee for example i think you now must become a specialist in specific tasks of the area you are working in .when you are working in the marketing departement of a consulting company for example you could specialize to the marketing of chemical products .in my eyes these steps of specializing in a specific subject are the best way to become not only successful in your job but also help you to divide the important informations from the unimportant ones .altough you should not lack a propper knowledge about other academic topics you have to specialize in order to be not provided with a overload of informations you can not handle with .
