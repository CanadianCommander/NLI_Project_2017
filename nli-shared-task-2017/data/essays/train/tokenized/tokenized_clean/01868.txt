some peopel say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .however , i disagree with the statement because i have felt that facts can automatically teach ideas and concepts in many situations .in history and chemistry class , the learned that i was able to learn complex ideas and concepts by simply learning facts .in my history class , u.s. history 1 honors , understanding the flow of events is as important , or more , as memorizing tons of factual informations .when i took the course s first test in the beginning of the semaster , expecting their to be only factual and straightfoward questions , i was amazed that how many ideas , concepts , and abstract questions appeared on the test .for upcoming tests , i tried to understand all these idea questions by asking myself questions like `` why did this happen ?  or `` why did this person tried to accomplish this ?however , i found myself often lost and getting these types of questions wrong on the tests .then , i figured out a new way to get around this problem .it was just to memorize more and more facts !by knowing a lot of facts that have happened , i was able to gather all these informations and draw conclusions out of these facts .then , i was able to answer the troubling idea and concept question more accurately , and i started to understand the history as whole .in addition , my chemistry class seemed like a pure essence of ideas and concepts in the beginning .the class required me to understand these abstract ideas like balacing chemcal equations or figuring out proper atomic masses .first , i was entirely lost and unable to learn how to solve these problems because i just could not understance the concept of it .the teacher tried to help me out by re-explaning these thoughts and ideas over and over again , and i still needed more help .then , it was factual examples which really helped me to get these .by looking at how the teacher and my friends solving these problems , i just learned what to do when problems approach to me .i immitated their ways of solving problems , and i was able to solve any chemistry problem on my own .this really made me think that learning factual process is as important as understanding the concept .thus , it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .of course , ideas and concepts are ultimate goals the students to achieve in school .however , before they try to reach it , they really should learn factual informations enough first .in that way , the students will feel much easier to understand the concepts .therefore , learning facts in firsthand is more important than understanding ideas for students .
