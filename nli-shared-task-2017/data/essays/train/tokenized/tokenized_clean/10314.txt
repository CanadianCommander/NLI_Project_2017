do you think people who always think and act same as other persons do will succeeed in the future ?i think people should try new things and take risks for their success .i have some reasons to support my opinion .first , i think many things are changing rapidly everyday ; for example , people s demands and preferences are different from yesterday .thus we have to think about new things and products .if we do nt care about this point , no one will be interested our business , and we will not succeed .second , risks produce big success for us .most people do nt want to take risks because they are afraid of the result .then , these people the safety way and get less success .they ca nt get much money or be supecial people .they are just general .however people who take risk will succeed because they chose very difficult way for them , and they will make an effort for success .motivation is tottally different among the two people .finally , people who do nt take risks do nt believe their abilities .they ca nt trust themselves for success .we have to believe ourselver for successs .in conclusion , for those reasons i agree with the statement .i think if we want to success , we should try risks and believe our possibilities and future .
