i not agree with this statement .i think there is much young people that help his community and spend a lot of his time for it .for example there are some volountaries in many places : in hospitals , in centers for old people . ..and so on .i know some people who works for the ambulance : they are volountaries who stay , some times also all night , at the ambulance to give his help in case of need , and the day later they are in office to work .there are also some girls i know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they re seek or need help .theese girls have a big sense of responsability in helping others , i think .moreover , my cousin is always around the community of her church ( she is much religious ) to give her help to guide and educate children .in her blood and heart there is the force to do this .she say me she feel much better when she helps the neighbours .i talked about some people i know , but i did nt say nothing about myself .that s why i have never done something for my community .this because i ve never had the occasion , or because i do nt think to be able to give help without nothing in change .i think that are very admirable people who do this , but also that you must feel it .i could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural parks when the community of my town organizes the event of cleaning the city . ..but i am sure i will forget it or i will decide do do something else that day . ..that s why really i do nt feel to give my time to the community . ..i m not a good person like my friends .so it s true , there are many people like me who do nt spend enough time for the community .it would be a better world if anyone would spend more of his time for that .i think also that this behaviour of people is not only of nowdays , it has always been so .but today there is more people who need help , also becouse the number of old ( and so seek ) people is larger than some years ago
