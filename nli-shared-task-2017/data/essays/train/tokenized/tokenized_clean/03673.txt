universities have considerably different educational systems .some focus on providing students with theorical concepts and ideas , while other opted for practical learning methods .both of these methods have advantages and i personally think that if a perfect educational system could exist then it should combine them .theorical concepts are necessary for students .indeed , they should help them to understand , model and simulate phenomena .no doubt they may complicated and perhaps boring to study , but students should pay attention to them and check wether they get them correctly or not .nevertheless , practical activities are also required in teaching activities .in fact , they can help students to understand theorical concepts .students will more likely understand a phenomena by a short experiment rather than by a long and perhaps boring lecture .they would understand it even better indeed .moreover students are generally more motivated to learn this way .in addition students understand better when they do thing by themselves through practical projects and so on .in other words , they understand better what they discovered themselves than what they had been taught by others .in my school , i had both theorical teachings and practical teaching , and from my experiece i can say that combining these two methods in the right way is very fruitful for the students .for example , i have had in two industrial internship .from these experiences i learnt a lot which i certainly could not have learnt otherwise .i learnt about how thing work in a company , how workers behave to each other and
