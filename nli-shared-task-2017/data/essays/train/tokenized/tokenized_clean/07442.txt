i agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the advertisements can make products seem more amazing and special , and it makes people want to buy the products .in addition that s the reason for advertisements .advertisements should make products better than real to attract people .first , the advertisement on the tv such as commercial shows can attract peoples attention .it s directly influenced peoples desire .if people watch the cool soda s cm in summer when they are thirty , they want to drink that kind of drinks even though they know these products are nt good for thire health .if they watch the tasty steak cm before the dinner , they want to eat steak .the visual moving advertisements have big influence to people s disare quickly .second , when you drive the car on the high way , you can see some advertisement bords next to the road .for example , when you go to local side , you can find the hotel or restaurant advertisement bords .it does nt have the big impact like commecial on tv , yet , it can effect your mind to think about that kind of things .it makes you think that you need it or not .also , in most situation , you want to get it at that time because this bord made it there for exactly that people need it at this time although the situation is that no choice because of in local area .third , if you read newspaper , you might also get some advertisement paper for seling house and new restaurants etc .it does nt pass you quckly like commercial show and advertisement bords .it can be left in your space , so you can look them later when you have time .it has some advantages .you can see that whenever , so it can be seen more than other kinds of advertisement things .it means it more effects to people s mind .for instance , on the sunday , if mother see the new restaurant s advertisement paper , she will ask about going to there to her hasband because ahe want to try new taste and she dose nt feel to cook today .in conclesion , the advertisements have many ways such as the cm on the tv , advertisement bords and advertisement papers .these has effective influence to people s desire to want to get products .unfortunatly , in many case , people felt kind of disappoint after they tried the products because before they try it , they were hoping too much .actually , the products are nt so terrible , but because of thire too much desire and they wanted that by not big desire , they ca nt be satsfied by the products that on the advertisements .of course , in some case , they can felt satsfied yet , it s less than oposite situations .
