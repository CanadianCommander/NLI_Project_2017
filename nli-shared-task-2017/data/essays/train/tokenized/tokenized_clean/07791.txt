young people are often independant and sometimes selfish .moreover , people who help their communities are usually quite old .so some people can say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there is truth but i do nt totally agree and i will explain why .it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is a fact that the members of this kind of associations are often old .there are no many young people in it .it is a pity because young people have much time and they could use it for that .there are even some young people who have fun when they disturb their communities , it is a real problem in some areas , for example in the suburbs of paris .but i do nt think it is really new as the statement seems to mean .it is a very old thing , solidarity was never very strong for young people .young people like to enjoy their life , they are independant , they spent all their time for their own life .and i think it is time for them to do that .i do nt think they have to be selfish and it will be good if they help more their community .but i understand why young people give less time to that .i think it is more a question of culture than a question of age .if there is a lack for helping nowadays , it is because of everyone .for example , a young people will be not encouraged to help his community if his parents do nt .this kind of behaviour is helped by the education from the parents and the school .everybody must do something to improve the situation and putting the responsability on young people is not the best thing to do .finally i think that it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .but i do nt think it is new and i think it is not the main problem .
