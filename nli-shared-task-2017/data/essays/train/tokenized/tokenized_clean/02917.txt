the statement says that in the next twenty years , we can observe only few number of cars , compared to the number we have today .i completely disagree with the idea given in the statement .because , i feel that car is the most basic and effective way of travelling between any two places .this number will keep on increasing to satisfy this basic need .of course , raise in petrol prices and other minor drawbacks will affect this number to a considerable amount .indeed , car is the most used automobile for traveling , because it is easy and faster .considering the technology advances and speedness in the lives each and every human-beings , we can confidently say that this number will ever increases all the time .it is simply because people will always look for better ways of transportation that allow them to move quickly to their respective tasks , especially in this modern soceity .also , it is quickly reached to a state of being a basic neccessity , rather than a luxury .hence , i dont think people will give up them so easily as one thinks .relatively , the design and technology aspects of these automobile manufacturing are keep on changing rapidly to meet new and advanced customer needs and also to compete with the problems like petrol prices .for instance , the research on using other alternative fuels instaed of petrol is going on a rapid pace , to nullify the effect of hike in petrol amd diesel prices .also , the automobile which have the compatibilty to adapt to diffrent kinds of fuels are launched the market , lets say , dual engine which works with both petrol and electricity .on the other hand , the increasing demand and hikes in the oil prices will affect the number of car sales in future .these problems can be overcomed by technology innovations as discussed in previous passage .but , still these innovations are nascent stage and as we can not predict the future , it is not the right time to say that these advanced technology will serve the pusrpose at maitainable costs .in case if they fail to offer the solutions at mominal prices , people may relie to public transportation system to reduce their costs and eventually lead to decrease in number of cars as on now .finally , i conclude that the statement , in the next twenty years , we can observe only few number of cars , compared to the number we have today , is pointless and is only based only few factors .hence , i strongly disagree with the idea .
