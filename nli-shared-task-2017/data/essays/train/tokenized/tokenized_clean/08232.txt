since i ve been student for a long time , i can say that at the age when we are young students ( for example high school age ) , we normally tend to care more to understand ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts .anyhow , i have to say that , at least as far as my experience is concerned , along the student age we change our learing process , passing from giving more importance on theory to linking theory to facts .for example when we talk about students untill high school , i believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools , family and social enviroment .at this age we do nt care , for example , about political events or international affairs .this is due to the fact that certainly we are too young , we are more focused on other things such as having fun , going out , doing some sports .what is more , we re completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts .on the other hand , when we go to the university , and this is another step of being students , i think the things change .it happens because we re getting in another enviroment in which we weant to be well considered , we re meeting other people with who we re going to share more adult experince and last but not least we re getting more mature .as a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied ( aslo during the high school ) to the real facts .for example it happens to me when i studied the concept of inflaction .when i was watching the tv news , i was really surprised to finally understand what inflation is and what are its effects .and this is not all .we re also becoming able to link some concepts that we ve learnt in the past to the real facts , and at that time you finally realize how was usefull to study that concept ( that at the beginning it has been considered stupid ) .so , i agree partially that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , because it could depends if we re considering high school student ( who are more focused in concept and ideas ) and university students ( who are beginning to link the concepts to facts ) .
