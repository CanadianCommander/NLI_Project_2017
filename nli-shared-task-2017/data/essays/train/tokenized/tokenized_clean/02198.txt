does young people really nowadays do not give enough enough time to helping their community ?i do not think that this statement has any value it is completly a baised statement .we have seen many cases in which young people come forward to help the society than in any other generations in the past .firstly , i should say that there is no support for the statement that young people have no time to spend , if we look into the records the young enterprenuer like bill gates are doing remarkable job as far as the community services are concerned .he is offering a great amount of his wealth towards the development of the society , he introduces and organises several schemes for the poor people and for the developing nations .according to the united nation s report published in june , 2005 the vast differences between younger people and old people as far as the number of persons who work for the organisations like world health organisation ( who ) , unicef and red cross .the younger generation not only work for the betterment for the society but also help the society in various ways by providing financial , technological , emotional supports to the society .according to the article published in the new york times dated on 26 february 2003 , it has been stated that according to the survey nowadays young people are doning remakable things as compared to the prevous days .they are taking active interst in the community services .young people are opting for the donations and their help as compared to the any other sections of the society .lastly , if we look into the figures of the young persons in the non profit organisations like the organisation run by the mother teresa society who are working for the betterment of the society we will find that a large number of young people are opting to be a part of these socity so that they will be able to help the weaker selction of the society .in short , it can easily be concluded that younger people is taking out the time from their busy schedule , they are well educated and know perfectly what are their duties towards the society anfd they are taking keen interest in doing social work for the society .young people do the best what the can in helping the society .
