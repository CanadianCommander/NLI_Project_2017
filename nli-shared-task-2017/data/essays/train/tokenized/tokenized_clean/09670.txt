i am agree with the statemant that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .to support my opinion i have a series reasons .i think that the presentation of a product is the most particular advertisement .you imagine a person that go to buy a product and that at the supermarket he has in his front two products that are the same but they are different sealed .of course a person will chose the product with the most beautiful packet even if the qualities of the two products are the same .this is an example to demostrate how our idea about a product can be influenced by simple factors .i think that television is the most important advertisement that does to seem a product much better than it really is .it is incredible how television influences the think of the people about a product .i have many friends that stated that they purchase only products that they view at the tv .they think that if a product is merchandised at the tv there is a good reason .this is true in some case but it is completely false in others .i think that it is necessary to valuate a product in all its characteristics and only after that to judge its qualities .however people have not time and in some case the knowledge to do all this work to valuate a product .so they buy the product that usually view at the television .enterprises do their interersts and out of dubts this is correct to merchandise a product .so enterprises do their game but customers would do attention at the real qualities of a product .
