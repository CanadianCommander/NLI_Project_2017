the topic in disguise deals with , a person being generalist or a specialist .a generalist is a perosn who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects .a specialist is a person who has deep knowledge in one subject .i think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject .a person with broad knowledge in many subjects , a generalist , can deal with any kind of subject thought he can not go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject .so he can deal with any of the subjects .where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject can not deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects .it is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades .even in case of getting a job , a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal any kind of subject that is given to him .where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject .the companies would definately require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject .`` as every coin has two sides  .we can not always say that having broad knowledge is vital .hence there is a saying `` jack of all trades but master in none  .a multi talented person with no deep knowledge in any subject can not acheive success all the time .knowledge in depth is required when it comes to certain areas of science such as astronomy , medicine etc .in these areas a person can not sustain with vauge knowledge .it is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth .else these proffesions would turn out to be disasters .hence what i would like to conclude is , a person must have minimum knowldge about all the academic subjects and must excel in one atleast to acheive success .
