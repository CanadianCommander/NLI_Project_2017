a striking feature of the modern world is the explosive growth of information .we witness a surfeit of information for a wide spectrum of topics .these topics are disparate and miscellaneous in nature .such a scenario offers ample scope for super specialization in any field .because of the vast amont of information that exists in every topic , specialists who are the masters of that one topic are in great demand .let me explain that statement by drawing an analaogy with a software company .the massive demand for specialized engineers in the company can justify the statement that super specialists are in great demand .however , i believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic fields would still be a more favourable proposition than specialising in any one field .let me justify this belief .consider an investor who must invest his capital in a company .having a broad overview of many issues would enable him to invest wisely .on the other hand , a specialist would be bound by his limitation of knowledge in only domain .also , let us consider that software company which was previously discussed .sure , it employs specialised engineers but the employee may actually be a manager who has a broad understandingof various facets of his company and not a deep knowledge of any one .and yet , his post is superior to that of the hired engineer .also , anyone who is equipped with knowledge of a variety of fields has the potential to try his hand elsewhere if any one venture does not work out for him .that gives him the versatility to explore several fields .the specialist may not have that option .today , we see several top companies being led and managed by individuals who may not be specialised in any one field .this is because these individuals with their broader perspective offer a multi-dimensional approach which is very helpful for any company s growth .the final decision depends on every individual s personal viewpoint .he might derive greater pleasure from complete mastery of any one subject and may prefer being an unchallenged authority on the same .i , however , see myself as the manager who ultimately deploys tasks to these specialised engineers .to me , the manager s job which involves being involved with sveral aspects and taking an integrated approach towards decision-making seems more exciting .that parallel explains why i believe having a broad knowledge of several domains is better than specialising in any one domain .
