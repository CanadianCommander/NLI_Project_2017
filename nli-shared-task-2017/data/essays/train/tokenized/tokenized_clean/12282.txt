young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people .age factor is one the main reasons that put life of older people whithin limits .first of all , most sports require an age limit , such as tennis and foot-ball .as an example , my father loves foot-ball but he can no longer play it , because he can not run as fast as he used to .another example is mountain climbing .most mountain climbers are young because this kind of activity require good heart rates and endurance , and as we all know , the older a person gets , the less his heart operates due to age factor .second , older people have less sex drive than they had before .also , old women can no longer have babies after 45th year of their age .young people can perform lot of sports activities .most sports players are less than 25 years old as required by most sports .as a result , unlike older people who are usually on diet or on medical treatments that prevents them from eating or drinking what they like , most younger people do not fall under those restrictions that prevents a person from doing what he or she likes to do .
