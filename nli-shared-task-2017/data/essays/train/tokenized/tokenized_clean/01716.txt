i agree with the statement that says , most advertisements make products seemmuch better than they really are .for several reasons this statement is true .for example , advertisements show only the good part of a product , and their only concern is to sell the product to the consumer no matter what suits him .advertisements only show how the product is great and wounderfull , and they even show it in a way that makes it look different .let us take a children s gum or a lolypop for instance , in advertisments you can see two or more children grabing one of those sweets , and when they try it , their appearance and the whole world changes around them and all of it becomes like a sweet dream .now , what kind of messege would an advertisement give to a child ?the answer is clear when you just take a look at a child in sweets section in any super market .those children who will try the dreamy product will feel that they wear tricked , simply because they will remain in their same spot with a normal taest .advetisements do care only about gitting bought regardless of wheather they suits the buyer or not .let us take clothes for instance , in advertisements you can see people from different ages wearing tha same styile and the same colors and the same fit .now , what would such an advertiement make people think is alright ?the answer is also clear from what you can see in the streets of poeple wearing things that are not appropriate for thier ages .in conclusion , i agree that most advertismen
