today , when we look at our environment we can see many cars than old years we could see .i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in passing years , it is observed that the number of cars is increasing fastly .i want to focus on reasons to increase cars .first reason that population is getting growth .many people start to use their individual cars .all families buy cars to their children or young people buy car by ownself .for example , in turkey many families who have 3 or 4 members have at least 3 cars .however , many companies start to improve theirselves .they use many cars for their jobs , especially for sales and marketing .they should sell or do their job by cars .another reason , cars are always seems people very comfortable .all people want to have a car .cars are comfortable because , you can go wherever you want , you do not have problems like missing busses and being late to school or job .you are free in a car , because it is yours you can listen to music highly .although another transporters are produced or government makes some campaign for their costs , pesple do not use these transporters such as trains , buses . ..etc .moreover , government costs much money to produce new highly technology vehicles for transporters .these are tried by people but it is not used in much time .also , there were many accidents when they were tested .new high tecnology vehicles are comfotable but not like a car .beacuse these vehicles are community , common used .the comfortable of these vehicles can not like cars .in conclusion , in twenty years or thirty years , there will be always increasement of cars .people produce comfortable and good technological cars also good anoth
