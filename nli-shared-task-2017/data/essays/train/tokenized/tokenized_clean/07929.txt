now , cars have become very convinient tools in our life .we can move anywhere if we have a car at least in our house .however , i agree with the opinion .there are thee reasons why i think so .first , reducing cars tend to decrease of the amount of harmful gass .recently , we are facing to the problem such as glorbal warming , air poolution , and many other ploblems .i am surely thinking that these problems are becoming worse and worse , and finally , we may face the serious situation someday .s decreasing cars cause to improve these problems .second , becoming fewer cars can also abolish the noise problem .residents in the central city may trouble with the problems because there are a great deal of cars are running close their houses .if cars become fewer , complaining about these noisy environment become fewer at the same time .finally , it can also reduce the rate of car crash accidents .according to the resent reseach , the death rate is becoming higher and higher by many tipes of car accidnts .to increase the cars rate also invite the producing the high rate of the car accidents .if the amounts of cars reduce , we can reduce such a terrible accident before hand than now .therefore , i storonglly agree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .certainly , life of using car is very useful , but there are many demerit as well as these convinient points .if we do nt have cars , we surely can find the other ways in twenty years .
