we are living in a community and have some responsibilities because of this .but many of us , specially the younger generation , do nt give enough importance to these duities .in this essay i will try to explain this fact by stating the reasons .it is a truth that younger generation of the society do not pay enough attention to help their communnities .as humans live in communities , it is our main duty to help the community , so that one day when we need help we w ll be able to receive from somebody else .but the conditions of modern life lead to a change in this picture .younger people generally spend time on so many different activities that they can not find any spare time to share with the public .for instance , they attend some schools , do different kinds of activities in the school , deal with the computer and also deal with the problems in their daily lives .as a result , most of the youngs can not find enough time to help their communities .even if they do , it is very limited .one other factor that prevents youngs from helping their communities is the misleading of the youngs by the community .this can sound strange , but it is also the communitie that is causing the problem .young people in the community are not tought enough about the importance of supporting the community .they have a lack of information on how serious this subject can be .thus , they do not clearly understand why they should help their communities .i can give an example on this subject from my personal life .the last time i went to a house for elderly , i had the chance of meeting many old people and learning about their experiences in life .they complained about the young people in the society and that they are not spending any timewith them .what is more , i was the only student who went there for the last two months .what was surprising for me in that visit , was one of the things that i heard from one old man .he said that it was the elderlies fault that they do not have any visitors now , because he even did nt teach the importance of helping the community , in some ways , to his own children .as s result , even his children do nt come to see him .it is true that young members of the society do not pay enough attention to help their communities .there are some reasons like spending time for other things and the miseading of the society on this subject .but it is also true that youngs should help their societies so that they can find help when they need .
