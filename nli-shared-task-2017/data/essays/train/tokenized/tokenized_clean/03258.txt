obviously this is true .everybody knows that marketing s importance in everyday s life is growing faster and faster everyday ; and advertisements play a fundamental role in this `` play  .the impact of images and sounds during a product s advert is more important than the quality of the product itself .how many times do we buy a particular kind of biscuits , cake , cleaning item , tissues , shoes ( and so on ) just because the day before we saw that fantastic advert with that catchy tune ?well , i think that this happens very very often .nowadays every serious company has got some expert people thinking about marketing strategies to have their product well spread .and the main part of these studies goes to advertisements .this study is based upon a lot of other things : people thoughts , polls and so on .exploiting this informations with accuracy , companies choose a mix of sounds and images that catches our attention .so , the point is : i agree with this statement , because it is obviously true and recognized ( who could say it isnt ? ), but i do nt agree with the way the companies exploit this kind of thing .i mean , yes it s their work , but sometimes there s so much difference between advertisements and quality that we could call it a crime !these kind of thing happens in music too . .when some popular music magazines like the nme wants to `` launch  a particular band , it begins putting these band s pictures everywhere , on the cover , on the back , in the middle etcera , so that the young kids think  oh , the nme ca nt be wrong  ...the consequence is that these bands reach a level of success that is not proportional to its skill .in the same way , companies spend lots of money in buying advertisement spaces in television or in the streets or in internet sites for their products and only a few for the product itself !yes , it s nice to see some adverts on tv ( maybe featuring some nice girl hehe ) , but i do nt agree with this excess hype .companies should spend less money for adverts and a little more for the stuff they produce !
