usually , the traditional image is made of young , dynamic and fresh people having experiences and fun .old people are represented as calm , settled down , retired and mature .this stereotype is used by ads , showing youngs in activity in a glamourous world whereas aging people are sleeping in a quite house doing their crosswords .as if the age was a clue of your perception of life , of the kind of activities people like and do .it raises the impression that young people enjoy more life than older people do .in the first part , we are going to highlight the points that can make us think that this statement is true .then , in the second part , i am going to present why i disagree with this misconception .it is widely shared that old people are at the end of their life so they had a lots of experiences and they know nearly everything .it is the typical image of the wise chief in african tributes .as a consequence , his culture is huge and he is not impressed , surprized by the things that are happening in his daily-life .his life is a routine with nothing exciting .on the opposite , children see everything with new eyes , every experience is a new feeling .for instance , babies are surprised by plane , they compared it to birds and do not understand how does it fly .they take advantage of every single moment because everything represents something they are not familiar with .then when they grow up , they are in better physical conditions than older people .it allows them to do extrem sports like surfing .as a student there is the traditional image of freedom that implies no responsibility and a lot of time to enjoy life .to me , this image is misleading .because aging people are coming closer to their death , they make up for lost time .they usually have the money , that the youngs do not have , to do what they like .for instance , my grandmother worked all here life without enjoying it .she saved her money and now that she is retired , she has plenty of time to travel when she wants and where she wants .she is very active and has a group of close friends with which she goes to the restaurant , to the theater and do lota of activities because she have the time and the money necessary .
