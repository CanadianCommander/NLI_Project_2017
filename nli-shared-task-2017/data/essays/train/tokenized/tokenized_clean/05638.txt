i think there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .there is two reasons like below .at first , the present population in the world is six billion , and it never stop to increase , and it is said the world population is growing with much more high speed .so it is certain that the demand of car also increases with the increase of the population .second , i think it is difficult that we invent a brand new vehicle that is more convinient than car in twenty years .we have already had another transportation system like plane , ship , bicycle , but they are used with different needs , and they are not useful as a alternative of car .
