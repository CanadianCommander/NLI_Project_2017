since i was a little girl , i have heard and read many successful stories of different people .i believe and agree that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first of all , my dance teacher always told us to get out from our comfortable zones when we are choreographing the dances .the dancers are tend to choreograph their favorite genre .for example , a dancer , who likes a genre of modern , has more possibility to choreograph a modern piece .however , if that person takes a risk to choreograph a hip hop piece , there will also be a possibility to be a successful choreographer .my teacher told us that we are going to research and think about the choreography if we try new things , which in this case a choreography .many of her students created masterpieces by taking risks ; those pieces were selected for the state festivals and other honored shows .there is a chance to become successful , but also not successful .it is a life .some people take risks and then lose their properties such as money , family , and more .taking risks has a huge risk .however , if we try again and again , success will come back to us .one of the famous cartoonist in the world , walt disney , had to try new things .because his company stole his character from him and gave it to other cartoonists of that company , he lost his job .but , he never stopped to put efforts ; the micky mouse was born .even though he could earn so much money , he tried new things such as making a long animated film for the first time .the things he tried had always risks , but he became successful eventually .he was a person that if he loves his job , he will always try new things .this is one way to be a successful .in conclusion , we should never stop trying new things in our lives .even we face hardships , if we try so many times , those efforts we put will be paid off .this is how to be successful .therefore , i agree that successful people are ones who try new things and take risks .
