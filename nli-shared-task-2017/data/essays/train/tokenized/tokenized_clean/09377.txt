i not agree with the statement that says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today because of some reasonable reasons .the main and most important reason i have to defend my opinion is that in twenty years the popullation would growth a lot , and not only in africa where the birth-index is enormous also in europe and in all america , and this is going to occur because of the inmigration , it could be legal or illegal , but all the countries are going to suffer the inmigration and migration proccess , instead of the laws and other inpediments governments will try .the second reason why i feel there are not going to be fewer car in use in the future is that in twenty years scientists are not going to be able to find a new and innovate transport method , like flying cars or what else some people think we are going to have in few years .yeah , it s true that some scientists have made a flying car but in the case they can comercialized it , it is going to be so expensive for the mid-people , so they are going to use the traditional cars .the last reason i am going to talk about is not as important and relevant as the two others , it is the comodity .nowadays the comodity is a very important factor of our society , all the innovations in technology or in other subjects are to make more comfortable our life .moreover , we create things not to thinking more about what to create , those things we have create are going to do that job instead of us .to sum up i have to say that i feel it is ridiculous to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
