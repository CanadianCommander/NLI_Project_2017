i agree successful people love to try new things and take risks rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .there are few reasons that i support .first , i think to be a successful person whose personality must be interest in anything .they like ti take adventatures and to do a lot of new things that are general people do nt want to do it .for example .my father is a successful businessman .he was born in a very small town in taiwan .in his family , there are no body want to go to big city to find a job .everyone is satisified with their life , thay do nt want to change their life styles .even thought they know to stay in the country ca nt be rich , but they still love to stay in the country .my father is different with other people .he knows if he work hard and know more about information from world , it must be help to his future and career .whatever how hard work , he always wants to try and he never afraid of challanges .because he knows that may be a good chance to change his life .and now he did it .second , i think if you never try new things , you wo nt know how will be change in your world .if you want a successful life , you have to try everything .to find every possible successful reason and do nt be afraid of to make mistakes .because any mistakes can make you find out what s problem in this situation and improve your ability .i believe to be a successful person needs to spend more time to do a lot of things and it must have a hard time to overcome .but one day when you become a successful person , you will know everything is worth .
