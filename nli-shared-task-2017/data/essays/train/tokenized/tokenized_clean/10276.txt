globalisation means opening up of the domestic market to the outside world .there has been development in all the areas and the situation is entirely different than it used to be twenty years back and therefore , i dont agree to the statement that , in next couple of years there will be lesser cars than they are now .the world as a whole has been developing very fast .there has been new discoveries , technologies , cost effective methods are being employed to increase production by reducing cost expenses .new cars have been coming in .some years back , only few models of general motor ( gm ) could be seen on roads but now the situation is different .competition has resulted in a slew of cars .new companies are coming in the market and with their cost effective models , are luring the customers .this kind of competition will continue to occur .consumer demand is also increasing .people are becoming richer and richer , countries are flourishing and thereby affecting the demand .since the choice of car selection has become wide individuals from various walks of life are able to afford it within their budget .attitudes of people has also changed .they now want to spend their life comfortably .since cars are a luxury commodity they dont mind to invest in it .unlike the people in the past who were merely interested in saving and were conservative , the new generation loves to face challenges .they have become more pompous , also competition among the colleagues is the reason for such a lavish lifestyle .everybody wants to spent more money than his neighbour .and this trend is going to continue in the future as well .nowadays , people have become so busy , for them time has become precious so in order to complete their work in time they always require an effective mode of transportation and nothing can be better than a car .hence , a redution in car use is a nightmare because people cant live without it .it has become a neccesity for them .
