when it is time to travel many people have the question in there heads .should we travel in a group led by a tour guide ?to travel like this it is often more expensive and of course , you do nt have the freedom to do what ever you want , but it has some advantages .the adventages are that you can visit more places , you have someone to explain you what you are seeing and that it s safer .one reason that i like to travel in a group with a tour guide in charge is that you can visit more places in the amount of time that you have .tours are designe to get the best out of the place that you are visiting .for example if you are going for only three days the guide shows you just the most important places , if you are going for five the guide may include some shopping and dinning .in this way the tour han really help you use your time wideslly .andother reason that i think is convenient to travel with a tour guide is that the guide can explaing what you are seeing .for example if you go to an old library build many centuries ago , the guide can explaing you dates and stories that you want to know .generallt the guides are well trained and they know all the history behaind every place the take you .i bealive the guide in a tour is a good source of information that can help you know more about the palce you are vesiting .finally , it s safer to travel in a group with a tour guide .not every place or city is equally safe .the guide , and beeing in a group , of course , can provide you with safety .some downtowns are not safe to walk , for example , and the guide can advise you of this places and ensure a safe trip .in summary , i think that traveling in a group with a guide is a very good idea .in this way you can get the most out of the trip and leave the place that are visiting with great memories full of knologe about the history and in one piece .
