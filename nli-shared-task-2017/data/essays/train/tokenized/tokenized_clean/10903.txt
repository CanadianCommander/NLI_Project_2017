it is often said that these days , youth do not allocate enough time to helping other people .i highly support this idea because today s society more weighs another values , such as personal skills and ability to win the brutally competition and youth also are more individualistic than the past .first of all , contemporary society prefers competitive warriors to warm-hearted ordinary people .in other words , people in modern society must win their enemies in thier field to succeed .there is no place for humanism such as helping others in this situation .for example , when i was a university student , volunteer works in agricultural town still were popular .however , nowadays that volunteer program are abolished because most of the student do nt apply .these days , a large number of students are very busy to prepare exam such as english fluency test or computer ability test .that s because that exams are helpful for their future career and job recruiting .moreover , nowadays , young people are more affected by individualism .they more weigh benefit of them than value of whole society .for instance , 1980 s korean university student councils were dominated by people who affected by socialism and communism .however , 2000 s korean university student do nt interested that value .they more concentrated their own ability and entertainment .as shown above , these days , youth do nt invest their time for their communities .that s because sociey has changed and people themselves are also changed .
