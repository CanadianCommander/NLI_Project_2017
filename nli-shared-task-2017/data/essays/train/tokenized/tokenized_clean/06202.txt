life is life !young people enjoy life more than older people do .i do nt agree whit this sentence .because some times old people are young , so they enjoy the life .also all ages have diffrence suprise in life .when people are young , they can enjoy life so much .the first of all , every people must enjoy the life every ages , other wise you can bore in life .but when you are young , you can enjoy the life more than everytnihn .because you want to try everything in the world .you want to go everywhere with your friends .when you are young , you have lots of enerjie to do something , you want to live life , you want to see everything .sometimes you can learn some lessons about life .it can be good or it can be bad for you .as well as , when you make lots of things , i will look fo extrime things .you want live in city life .you can go bars , cinemas , restourants . ..like lots of things .also you want to earn lots of money to buy expensive toys , because this is the life .but in ages you will be old man or woman .you can lived lots of things but without somethigs .because in first paragraph i told you .life has supries in every ages for you .when you will beacome old .you can enjoy the life .maybe you dont like to city life , you can move to seaside or little town .you can grove your furits , or ou can play with your dougthers .when you will became old , it doesnt mean life is end .that was the reason you can do lots of thing when you became old .but not extrime things because you wont afford it .just you have to know how to enjoy the life .
