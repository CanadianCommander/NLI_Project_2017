yes , it is .they can not learn facts without understanding ideas and concepts .it s the logical order .because , facts will be modified and depend to the concepts .for exemple , in science , physically scientists ca nt do a new investigation if they do nt know the rules , of the fonction , of human bodies .when they get the necessary theories , they can establish a hypothese and bring a proximative conclusion that they expected .it s like as we see the examination treated with mouthes .if they seek a new drugs for certain sickness , before testing inventing drugs directly on the humain bodies , they will test on another animals , like mouthes .and before the execution , they need to study on the natural function and caracteristics of this animal , comparing with its of humain beings and on the base of that , they intend to do pass to the next step for gain the best conclisions that they expect .if you change the order they can not noticifie of their failors , if they fail , or in the same time , they canot be sure that they will get the this conclusion in which way and for what cause .for exemple , imagin that they invented a drug for the cancer , they test it on a suffer .the cancer stopped to spread in his body .why ?
