i actually think that it is true : a product looks usually better in the advertisement than in real .but i also think that it is normal and i m going to explain why .first , advertising exists for two reasons : it informs you of every new product that comes out on the market and it encourages people to buy it .when you look at an advertisement in the street or on tv , the advertiser wants you to need this object and to think about buying it , to desire it .obviously , you will see the product ( materiel or not ) in its best aspect , sometimes presented with others products that improve the image of the product .that is the case for all the food product : for example , meat will often be presented with some beautifull vegetables or a charming sauce .and you will never see a parfume presented by a normal man or woman but by one or several top models .in this situation , it is not the product itself that is more beautifull but the context and you have the impression that the product is better than in your hands .besides , advertising is a kind of art , and sometimes helps research for the cinema .you can test new techniques , try to film some places ( the film `` the lord of the rings  was filmed in new zealand after the landscape was tested or remarked in an advertisement ) .that explains also why such money is put in advertisment and why they are often so developped and beautifull .but the product seems better to a certain extent and they can not be physical differences between the product on tv and in the supermarket : the consumer is protected by a law that forbids to make false advertisement .so i will conclude saying that advertising enhance the image of the products and it is better like that .it only concerns us to be aware of that and not to be foul .
