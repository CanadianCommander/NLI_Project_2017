in the following i will try to discuss the statement and show examples in addition to my arguments .first of all , we got to make sure that advertising products is a very important factor in todays economical competition .the advertiser has to advertise the product , because in the competition of the market there will be a lot of similar products and much more that are alike .the better the product is advertised , the more people will buy it .the advertisement has to be as funny , as inventive , as surprising , as basic as possible depending on the target group .usually the advertisement tries to focuss the people s interest on the product .of course the product is allways presented in the best light and the weaknesses are hidden , but the people now have the possibility to get information on the product and in todays media there are many ways .there are papers on allmost every topic , from car to plants in your garden .the internet provides an amount of product tests and mostly the product is just a better form of a former product , that should already known .because of these possibilities of informing oneself , i think it is not the fault of the advertisement if someone is disappointed about a product .but sometimes you get the feeling that the producer has spent more time on the advertisement than on the product itself .only at this point , i think i can agree with the statement .but developing a bad product and only focussing on the advertisement will be discovered soon by the users and affect the sales of the product badly .therefore i think it s not in the interest of the company to bring bad products on the market and cut there own skin .lastly , it is very important to be aware that advertisment is a necessary part of a product circle and in that context i can not agree with this statement .
