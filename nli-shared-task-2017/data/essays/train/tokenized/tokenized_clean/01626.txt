due to the advances in psychology now we know more about how human brain works ; that is to say , we know how people react , think and evaluate things they see .i think that these informations are highy employed in the production of advertisements and today advertisements are as persuasive as they have never been before .they can induce you to buy some goods that you do not need or do not consider buying by exhibiting them as if they were much better and more necessary than they really are .because they rely on science .first and foremost , there are some bugs in the thinking patterns of human beings and advertisements abuse these bugs .for example , they manipulate people by using words with positive meanings which have special impacts on your subconcious .moreover , advertisements use some color tricks to persuade you to buy the products they exhibit .there are particular pscyhological impacts of any given color .advertisement makers also make best use of these color tricks to impress you .besides , they repeat so-called magic words in advertisements accompanying a vivid tune .once you heard one of such tunes , you sing it throughout the day .this shows how these tunes have substantial effects on people .yesterday , while i was watching tv i saw a new keyboard .the man talking on the advertisement was assert that this keyboard was designed very ergonomically and it could ease the pains on your wrinkles if you are a game addicted .he also said that they guarantee no disorder for 5 years and a pay back guarantee i you don not like that keyboard .there was a vivid song on the background and it was obvious that they were meticoluosly chose the colors .finally i decided to buy it , but i had no need for it .to sum up , i think it is unwise to deny the impact of advertisements on people .they are designed in the light of latest advancements and findings in the field of pscyhology .today , advertisements are extremely inducive and people are highly vulnerable to them .
