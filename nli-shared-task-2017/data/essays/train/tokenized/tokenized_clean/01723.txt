i agree with the fact that the young people have do not spend sufficient time to help their communities .in an ultra modern world and a speedy world like this one need to do many things for themselves .the main aim of an youngster is to get a well settled career .inorder to achieve a high career he needs to do that extra bit in every mark of his acticity .secondly he does nt find time to do all those community services .the thing is to find a career as interesing as he likes he need to do many things like going to the college , spending on the materials he has to collect for his college , preparing for the college .he does that extra bit every where he participates .this makes him completely enervated by the time he feels that he will help the community .the youngsters think that its not the right time for them to serve the community .they may think that they may serve the community after they are well settled in their careers coz that gives them ample time .a well settled career can give the authority for them to help the community .majority of the youngsters has no interest to do all those community services .the fault lies with the family members .if an youngster is wasting time for the community services he may get a jerk from his parents what the hell are you doing .dont waste your time in serving those people .its time to change the attitude of parents rather than youngsters .if an youngster is to lend their time for helping there is someone s fault in the administration .its the administration s work to see that everything is fine in the community .one ca nt blame the youngsters for others responsibility .
