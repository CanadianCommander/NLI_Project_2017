advertisemnets are generally used to market different kinds of products to consumers .i would agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .this is because each and every company tries to advertise their product as superior when compared to that of the competitor .in trying to do this the companies will make their product seem much better than they really are to increase the sales of their product .advertisements are meant to be informative but there are some companies which advertise their products with little or no information .i think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because they are made attractive by using different colors .also advertisements use women to create a sex appeal .in most of the cases the advertisement does nt reveal all the inofrmation about the product as they last for few minutes .so only with the information the people obtain from the few minutes they decide to try the product and will get dissapointed when they do nt like it .in case of pharmaceutical advertising fda did not regulate the advertising of over the counter medication so at that time people checked the advertisements on telivision and they started using the medication by themselves without the advice from the physician .this harmed many people so fda statred regulating pharmaceutical advertising and asked pharmaceutical companies to disclose the side effects , use , contraindications and adverse effects of the drug .for instance after seeing an advertisement of a new stereo system i felt i would find all the features required by me in that product .but after i bought i realised that it was not as good as i expected it to be .i really had problems for long time and i could not find some features listed in the advertisement .in conclusion i would like to suggest the advertising production to make an advertisement more realistic , relevant and informative .
