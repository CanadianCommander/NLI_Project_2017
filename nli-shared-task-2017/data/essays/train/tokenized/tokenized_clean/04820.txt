some people think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .the rest of the people disagree with this idea .i belong to the second group of people .because specializing in one subject is more reasonable for me due to the reasons of that one can not be considered as special if he or she knows little from every subjects and one can get confused by trying to deal with multitasks .firstly , knowing one topic with its every details makes a person special .for instance , two research assistans of chemical engineering studies can be thought to clarify the point .one of them has researches in many areas including , fluid dynamics , heat and mass transfer , thermodynamics and complicated process control systems , while the other one searches a special subject related to heat and mass transfer .he just want to know more about the design of plate heat exchangers .finally he will an extensive background , whereas the first guy looses himself in many areas .so a special company interesting in heat exchangers can offer a job to the second guy .nevertheless first guy can not be thought an expert in any area to be hired by a special company .secondly , managing multitasks at the same time requires another knowledge and capability not to be lost in many areas .first guy in the example before may get confused when he see that a perfect design of a heat exchanger is not as good as the inventors think .it may lack a control equipment from the process control point of view .however , he is not aware that it is unneccessary to have this property for a heat exchanger since he has not enough informations in both areas .as a result , knowing one specific subject well gains a person specialities .with this special properties , he or she can differ other people during his or her life , although this person has not extensive information in other areas .
