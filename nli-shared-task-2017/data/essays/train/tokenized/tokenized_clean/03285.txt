i think that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .they do make lots of goods more appealing , and colorful or handy .the truth reveals when you buy it and us it .although advertisement is imprtant to a new products in the market , to show people a new line of food , computers or services .it does not require to run the advertisement too many times a day .i think that any good relaiable goods and services will eventualy control the market , regardless of how many times other products would run their advertisements because they will fail in the selling process as long as they are not as good .when i want to buy a computer , for example , i think first of dell , although there are lots of other popular brands which they have lots of advertisements that run several times on several tv chanals and even on the newspapers .i still like dells  computer .i guess lerning from personal experiance is way more valiable than all the nice things you see and hear about a products in an advertisements .another example of service .when it comes to a tv cable i like direct tv , .this also because of a personal experiance .the service that i had before was not relaiable and nothing even close to what they advertise .you could never talk to a person when you call them after having a problem .which happened to occure too many times .like losing the singnal .aside from that .i had always woundered how much these people ( producers ) are making to be able to afford these expensive advertisements .because this tells me that the products would really be much cheaper if they have not wasted lots of money on these advertisements .although the role of advertisements is very important , it mostly has been over used .for example , in the city where i live i keep seeing this advertisement on tv that talks about how wounderful this chain of resturants are .the funny part is , this chain of resturants is not existed in the state where i live .total wast of money , unless they expect from me to travel to other state to have a dinner .
