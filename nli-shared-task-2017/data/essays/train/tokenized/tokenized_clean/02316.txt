i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because i believe that the people who have strong wish to be successful , are more likely to be successful .my father is a business man who works for the japanese company .when i was young , my father s job was to trade oil , and the company asked him to go to ny with family to work there .when i arrived ny with my mother and father , i was surprised because the other business man who worked there were at least 10 years older than my father .i asked my mother why , and she told me that my father is one of a rare case .he always suggests new things and trys new things that the company has never done , so he is working with older people who is working much longer than my father .when i heard of it , i thought it is good to challenge new things rather than only doing what i already know .there is another strong example which i have seen in television about a week ago .i was watching the japanese tv programme which is about successful people in japan .on that day , they were showing about one singer who is very popular in japan now .in the programme , he said that he was actually a business man when he was twenty years old , and suddenly he quit his job to be a singer .he loses his job and had a very hard time until the famous music producer found him , but he said it was a priceless time which was crucial to his life , because he still remembers those times and he even wrote a song about that time .due to those reasons , i strongly belive that people who try new things and take risks will be successful .even though they have difficult time before being succeeded , you will learn things from that time for sure , and your success will be even more valuable .
