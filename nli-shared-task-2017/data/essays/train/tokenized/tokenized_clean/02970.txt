i agree or desagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , depending on the size of the group .i desagree if the group is so big .i had the opportunity to travel with a big group to a country that nobody knew before .it was a very bad experience because the tour guide was in trouble because he was responsible for everybody and during the traveling some got lost .some wanted to spend more time looking at other things and some wanted to take pictures and got lost , etc .so , i do nt recommend traveling with big groups .instead , i agree that the best way to travel is in a small group led by a tour guide if it is considered the following :first , the group has not to have more than ten people .in this way , the group can be well managed according to the cirscunstances .for example , you can easily rent a van to visit some other places that are not in the itinerary or you can plan a party during the nights .second , the people that are traveling together need to have almost the same age in order to have fun .it is not easy when you are traveling with old people that you can hurt with a simple noise or with anything that they do nt like .and third , do nt let the tour guide to take all the control over the itinerary because they can be like a father carrying little children .i have been seeing tour guides that do nt give any flexibility to the groups .being in other countries and other cultures the group wants to experiment the new environment , especially at night if they want to have a party , and not having someone to tell yor `` time to go to bed  .
