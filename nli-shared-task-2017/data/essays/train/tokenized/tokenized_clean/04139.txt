i agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take risks earlier than other people .in my opinion successful people know what to do for a well doing business .they are more confindet because of there success .i think only the developing of new ways and new technologies can make you successfull for a long time and that is what the they want to have .success for the rest of their live .they know that when they stay at there level , maybe the others will enforce them and then they fall down at a lower level .so the invention of new things is also a defense mechanism .i think , if you are successful and you do the same work everyday than you get borred on what you are doing .for good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is borring you even can not enjoy it .another reason for taking risks is that the people maybee will not loose there jobs when they are unsuccessful .that gives them the possibility to improve new procedures .propably the fact of beeing restless and of taking risks is the key for beeing successful .and when you are succesful it is easier to try new things .think about a person how sells newspapers the hole day , if he try new things for selling more newspapers , it can have a bad end for him .if his plan failed than he might loose his job and even that is the reason for him to not take the risk .all in all , i think the main reason for trying new things is that the person who take the risk is much more self-convident like the others and self-convidence makes winners .
