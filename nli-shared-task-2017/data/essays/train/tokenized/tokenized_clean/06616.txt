the goal of advertisement is to attract people to buy a product , and therefore they make look the products better than they are .i agree with that , and i will explain with some pratical examples this theory .most commercials are these days shown on tv , the biggest mass media that we know .specified products are sponsorized between certain hours , for example , during a cartoon show generally are sponsored products for kids .at night , depending on the movie playing , the commercials change too .if it s a romantic movie , we are most likely to see commercials for products that are used by women , or if it s an action movie the target is the male gender .some products , such as lingerie , tend to show perfect female bodies in order to attract both sexes .women will be incentivated to buy it because they will find themselves attractive as the models , and men will connect that image to a sexual pleasure .sex is , in fact , part of our instinct , and that s where the advertisement are made to hit .another area where we are more sensible is food , but it s a more delicate subject , because women want to lose weight in a healthy way , while men focus more on the taste .this way , it s very important to advertise a food that both men and women like , not considerating the children .since we have been bombarded of images of perfect bodies , houses , family , lives . ..the new commercials are trying to give more of a realistic image ( without losing that aura of magic ) , therefore we still will see beautiful women , but maybe in company of not as that attractive men , making feel the buyers at the same level as them , and not anymore looking at these `` gods  as inaccesible .but the new target of advertisement are the children , since they are left more and more in front of the television , and also because generally in the families they have the control of the remote .anyway , i think that a more specified type of advertising , focused on a restrained target , is yet more effective , but it s more dangerous because it s reaching some levels never seen before .we are always looking for the latest status symbol , which is normally a very fancy and useless gadget , but i m afraid that is too late to go back .the only thing that i suggest is to reduce the amount of commercials , because honestly , i think that all of us are sick of them .
