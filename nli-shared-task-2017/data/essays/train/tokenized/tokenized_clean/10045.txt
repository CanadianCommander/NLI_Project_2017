nowadays it is quite normal to be confronted with advertisements in many fields of life .they follow us just everywhere .the more advertising is influencing our daily life , the more it seems necessary to have a critical view on it .it is a controversial issue , if adverisements show products how they really are .i think they do nt and want to give my reasons for that in the following .while thinking about objectivity of advertising , you should keep in mind the aims of advertising .the industry is interested in selling as much of their products as possible .they will do anything for their products being bought .therefore they have to present them to the people as adorable as possible .today they have to face the problem , that people is flooded by a big amount of information every day .it s getting more and more difficult to attract the consumer s attention .so they have to fancy new and more spectacular ideas to catch attention .seldom they can reach this by just presenting a product as it is .there are different ways advertisements let their produkts seem better than they really are .for example , they show the products in a very nice environment with beautiful happy people using them .so the consumer may think , that he could feel as happy as they do , when he buys the product .while watching advertisements that exaggerate the quality of products , i often feel bored .but there is another possibility to attract the watcher s attention , that i like a lot more : humorous advertisements .they catch your attention with a joke which seems a lot more amusing to me .although i ca nt deny getting amused by exaggerations as well , if they are expressed quite clear .i think there is no doubt about that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
