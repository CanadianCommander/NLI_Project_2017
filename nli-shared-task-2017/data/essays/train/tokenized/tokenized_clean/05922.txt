do young people enjoy life more than old people do ?this is a very difficult question to answer and to be honest , i wonder , too .but for sure i can give you a view out of a young persons perspective .i surely can state that i alway want to enjoy life to the maximum .so now we have a different viewpoint on this question , respectively on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .maybe do young people have more and better opportunities to enjoy life than older do ?i m asking myself what is needed to enjoy life ?i start to think about what makes me happy .time and money plays an important factor to being happy .but also friendships , a rewarding job , familiy , sexual life , inner peace , living standarts and peace in general as impacts on howmuch you enjoy life .let s take the first two points i mentioned , time and money .i already see a conflict here .when you young , you usually have time , but no money to fullfill your dreams .there are certain points you can fullfill yourself which makes you enjoy life at the time your young , but for sure not all of them .for example you wo nt have the money for spending beautiful shoping weekends in new york and sleeping in a beautiful hotels - okay , fair enouth , not everybody is looking for that , but as mentioned in the begining , i m writting from a personal point of view .you start to study hard to become maybe an important personality in future so that you finally could bring up hte money for doing this new york-shopping trips .but then , well , you won-t find time anymore .so you always will look forwards till you get retaired for finally spending your over years earned money , but then you might not be in good health conditions anymore .my point is , to conclude , that there in every life-section will be certain points you enjoy to the maximum but on the other hand points you ca nt fullfill - certainly for that special moment not .you always will keep on dreaming .
