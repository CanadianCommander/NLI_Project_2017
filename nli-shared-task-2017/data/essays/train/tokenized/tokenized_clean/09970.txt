in the actual society , the marketing is very used for the factories to trying to sell their products .they use famous people and they make differents actions , but when you try to make it at home , you see that it s impossible .for example , there are lots of advertisements about products for cleaning the house .when the girl of the advise use it , she needs only few minutes to obtain an important results in their clothes , the oil of a jeans dissapear in 30 seconds or the white of a shirt return .other example is the car whose colour change with the weather , it s not true , but they make a nice advise and you think that it s possible .furthermore , this products are more expensive than other with the same characteristics only because their adverisements are more popular and because they have spent much money in them .there are persons who believe in this advertisements and when they buy it , they show that it is nt that they hoped .but , only if every person buy this product one time , the factory will be rich .for it , the factory only think that they must attract the more quantity of costumers however they buy the product only in one ocassion .in my opinion , the government should make more restrictions with this advertisements .they should study their skills and they make a ranking of the betters products .nowadays , is very usual to see a little letters in the products where we can read that this products has passed all of the requirements and it has a very good quality .
