i do agree to the statement , that the undestanding of ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts , but only to a certain extend .concepts and ideas are structures , which are very versatile , what means that the student is able to solve problems by himself using these thinking patterns , that make him independent .understanding of ideas is in my opinion also very important when it comes to have own one s , because if a scientist had never undestood formulars , instead of just learning them , their could have never been any progress .another example is the way of thinking , that students learn in school , and when i say that , i mean the critical thinking , to question things , and to take nothing for granted , which is a concept , a concept of thinking , which allows the students to work with in every job or part of life , it is the basis .therfore i do agree , that concepts and ideas are of great importance , but they could not exist without facts , that have to be learned simulantiously .questioning is good , but we need a knowledge , to be able to question something , and that knowledge of facts needs to be learned .for exmaple , how could someone dicuss the meaning or the intent of literature if he had no knowledge about the time , the piece was written in , or about the author or the genre ?in my opinion , concepts , ideas and facts do only unfold their full usefulness and reasonablity , when they go hand in hand , so that the owner of these abilities can create ideas , based on facts and worked out with concepts .
