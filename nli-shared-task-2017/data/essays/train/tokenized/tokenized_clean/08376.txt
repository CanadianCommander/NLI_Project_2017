in general i agree with the statement .i only agree in general because i think one has to take lots of things into consideration .it is is true that especially nowadays young people do not help communities a lot .helping the community  is a very broad term , when i read this i understand contributing or becoming actively involved in a community .especially in these days it seems to me that people in general , young people included , expect more from a society and community than what they are willing to give .there are certainly various projects and possibilities to become involved .however , especially in the last years the development of media , video games and goods of consumption in general desensitized a lot of people , especially the young generation .this leads to unawarenes of problems that might exist , or even when recognized to an unwillingnes to act .also i think one has to consider the social backgrounds and sorroundings of young people .if a young person grows up in a society where nobody cares about contributing to society and their community , how is he or she supposed to learn that it is necessary to be involved in the community ?on the other hand , it is common sense to become active .it is a taking and giving , if the giving aspect does not work properly , the community will not be able to uphold the services it offers .especially young people are not aware of this process .therefore , i do agree with the statement .however , instead of blaming the young generation , something has to be done so that young people get encouraged to be a part of a community and get active .
