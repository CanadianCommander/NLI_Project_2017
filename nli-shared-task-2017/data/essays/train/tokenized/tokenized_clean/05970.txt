it is controvertial whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .some people disagree with the idea that it is impossible to reduce using cars because today we are so depend on car .however , in my opinion , i agree with the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .first , in reality , now , we are faced with the lach of oil or any fuel .second , by developing the technique of science , we may invent more innovative transportation to go to all around the world .to begin with , now , there is state of lacking the any fuel .we efforts steadily to find new fuel like hydrogen dioxide fuel , nuclear energy and wind power energy .however , these could not be replace of oil fuel .also , in the world , there were still war to have the fuel priority .according to the korean broadcast in seoul , in the 50 years , there were no fuel resources in the world .in this sense , car which depend on fuel could not be used in 20 years .next , getting development in science , our scientist would invent a lot of innovative transportation .maybe , as we seen in `` matrix - which deal with the future - , that situation would be coming .people could move in just second as the girl in matrix and could move using machines like rocket .in addition , we could be fly in the sky .if the scientists can make up the circumstances which does not have gravitional force , we could move freely the side to anothe side .this is not familiar with me , now , however , in 20 years , we do nt know what happens are occur .this clearly shows that in 20 years we could use another transportaion .in conclusion .i agree with the idea that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the reasons that i mentioned above .first is lack of fuel and second is our scientist could invent more convenient transportation machines .
