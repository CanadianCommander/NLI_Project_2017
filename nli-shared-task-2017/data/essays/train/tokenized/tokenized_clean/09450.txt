i would like to start by stating an old idiom ` nothing succeeds like success` !which implies that if one suceeds in one field he is more likely to succeed in other fields also .and i think it s true and successful people do have better chance in in succeeding in new fields .firstly switching to any fild requires finance and funds at disposal .and if one has succeeded in a particular field he would definitely be having savings or earning to take risks .and even if they loose they have cushion behind them as they can again go back to the field in which their name has already been establishjed .and to add to this when one has earned fame or goodwill in one field they can easily utilize that goodwill in other type of fields too .we have many examples of well known actors switching to modelling and endorsing commercial brands .the most important factor according to me is confidence .success brings confidence togeather with it and is the main factor that encourages the person to take risk and succeed .moreover a successful person is having experience which he can very well utilize to gain and reducing the probability of failiure .this is true that one should not gamble in a field he is having less knowledge of but also one should not be adverse to risk , as risk and success are directly related .one who is taking risk may or may not succeed , but one who does not try and take risk can never succeed .and its quite obvious that a sucessful person can take risk with much less fear .in the end i would like to conclude by saying ` risk is not everyman s game  and aa successful person is the one who trys new things rather than sticking to one !
