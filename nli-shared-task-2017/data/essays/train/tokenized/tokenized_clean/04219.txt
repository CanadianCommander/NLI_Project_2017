a true learning is one where the students are clear with basic ideas and concept of the problem .this the way by which they can solve many problems without complexities involved in it .though , fact about the perticular topic is important to know and it forms an important element , without which learning is incomplete but understanding the ideas and concept are equally required .for example , a child wants to learn about how to solve a mathematical problem like addition or substraction .then it is very important that he knows the concept of the problem .it is important for him to identify where he has to add up and where he has to substract .this will help him out to solve similar kind of problem in future , only becuase the ideas and the concepts are clear to him .further , we can learn the facts only by making inferences and drawing conclusions which involves the complete understanding of ideas .only then it will be possible to reach to a conclusion and eventually to learn about the fact .for example this is the fact that earth is the only planet where life exists .the main ideas and reasons behind it are becuase of the favourable atmosphere , presence of oxygen , earths distance from the sun etc.these things helps us to make a conclusion about existence of life on earth .which is the fact .in other words , the concept of a model which was suggested by a scientist with sun at the centre in the planet system , one can give reasons and explain the fact that earth is locatedat a perticular distance .so , what is more important is , to first have a basic idea about a concept and then learn the fact which is associated to it .this is the way any problem can be solved with better understanding and improved learning ability .
