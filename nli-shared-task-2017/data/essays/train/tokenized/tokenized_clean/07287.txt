i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people to .while i would concede that older people are more likely to be struggling with health problems or to have experienced hardships over the course of their lives , these factors are not exclusive to older people .moreover , one can enjoy life inspite of such negative experiences .given the right circumstances , hardships paradoxically might increase your ability to enjoy life .if you have a positive attitude , misfortunes can teach you - at any age - to value the good things and the happy moments , to count your blessings .if , on the contrary , you have a pessimistic outlook on life and always find something to complain about , you will experience less joy in life , regardless of your age .in addition to age , other outside factors , in my opinion , also play a much smaller role than is commonly assumed .at first glance , enjoying life would seem to come easy to people that are in good health , independently wealthy and feeling loved by a significant other or a close set of friends .but on second thought , when we try to remember the times we have felt happy and enjoyed life most , what come to mind are usually little precious ( and fleeting ) moments in time that had little to do with money , for instance .none of these positive outside factors hurt , of course .nevertheless , i am sure we have all seen friends with chronic illnesses and empty bank accounts having a blast , while others have a tough time finding joy in seemingly rich and full lives .all in all , i disagree with the statement because enjoying life does not depend on age or other external factors as much as on one s personality and attitude .a little lucky star , of course , does not hurt .
