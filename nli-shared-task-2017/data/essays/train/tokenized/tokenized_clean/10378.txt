different studies and investigations have been proving during years , how contaminating a car is .however the number of cars continues to increase at time passes by .in fact , i am not an expert in the subject , but i would say i disagree with the statement listed and predict an increase of cars in the following twenty years .in the fisrt place , simply because the world s population is growing .people are having more and more children , and those children get to be adults who can buy their own cars .therefore , if the percentage of car owners stay constant , the number of cars will increase .for example , if the percentage of car owner is 10 % , and nowadays the population is 100 people , and in the futur this population grows to 120 people , then the number of cars would pass from 10 to 12 .the second reason i can find to hold my opinion is very much related with the first one .since population is growing there are no more space for everyone in the cities , and , thus , living in the city is becoming more and more expensive .therefore , nowadays one can choose to have a more cheaper and calm life in the outskirts of the city , and in that way one is able to buy a car and travel to the city to work everyday .in the third place , i think there is an economical reason for which the number of cars will increase .manufacturing tecnhiques are improving , making the construction of a car simpler and cheaper , which makes the final product much more cheaper and accesible .for example in my grandparent s time having a car in argentina was a real privilege for cars were luxury products .today , on the contrary , though not everyone can have a car , most of middle class people in argentina can afford one .however i also think that there are many different ways in which the number of cars can be regulated .in my opinion each government should find it s own way to incentivating people to use alternate means of transportation such as buses or subways to reduce the number of cars .clearly the process is not easy but if nothing is done , and the number of cars keeps increasing , then the contamination caused would be really terrible and impossible to correct .in conclusion i think that if things keep on being the way they are today , in twenty years the number of cars will not be reduced but increased .population growth , their need to move out of the cities and to move themselves daily , and the prices on cars are just some reasons i can find to predict such increase .however , this increase can be reversed if action , mainly form the governments , is taken to regulate the numbers of cars .
