i personally diagree with the statement that says that young people do not give enough time to their communities .i disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people .in addition to that the statment is a non credible statement because it is abviouly based on personal opinion rather than on facts , since it is not supported by statistics or any menaingfull numbers .the statment carries alot of hidden meaning or even insults to young people because it pictures them as selfish people who does nt care about their community .not only that but it also indirectly indicates that young people are irresponsible people who do not positively contribut in their communities , and are not active/usefull members of their own community .in addition to that , the statment that has been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their communities .there are some young people who are addicted to charity work , and who dedicates a lot of their time in helping improve their community and in helping others .thus we ca nt generalize .i also disagree with such a statement because i personally think that it is a weak statment becaue it is not supported by any kind of eveidence such as a survey , statistics , or any meaning full numbers .to me this statement is just like throwing accusasions on others .such statments are not acceptable to me not only because i disagree witth this particular statment but because if i accepted such stereotypes it means that i might as well accept other stereotypes .and by doing that i ll be encouraging stereotypes that might be more serious or even dangerous and that might seriouly affcet our society , community , or even the way or even the quality of our living .
