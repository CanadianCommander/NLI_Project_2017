the world we live in is getting more and more an egoistic , self-focused world .it is true , at least in my opinion , that people are more reluctant nowadays to give their time to helping their communities .however , i do not think this to be a characteristic of young peolple only .actually , i believe adults are the first ones to give us this bad example .pursuing always more their careers and always spending more time for themselves rather than for building up families or caring for their old relatives , the adults of this new millenium seems to prefer living by and for themselves rather than placing themselves inside communities .this is at least the picture that the television and movie industry show us . .just looking at worldwide famous sit-coms like `` friends  and `` sex and the city  , it is imposssible to find there portrayts of adults interested in something different than their jobs , their friends , basically their lives .younger people , instead , are becoming more and more sensible to their communities , probably because that feeling of `` enlarged family  that in the past was typical of small cities has disappeared during the last years .european community launched many programs of national and international volounteer jobs in order to make youngsters understand how important is to be part of a larger community and share experiences with other , offering what you have and getting back what you lack .an already ten year-old association active in the city i live in , called `` time bank  , aims right at this purpose : you give others your time and help when you can , and in return they give you a `` time check  by which you can ask back the time you donated to others when you will be in need of it !it is therefore generally true that people have become more selfish and not always willing to help other members of their communities , but i also think that this will all change soon - mainly thanks to young people - because we have all understood that it is not easy nor good to live like floating islands on the same ocean , but is way better to start living as a real , strong community .
