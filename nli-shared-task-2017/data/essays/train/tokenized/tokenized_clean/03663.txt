to begin with , i do not agree with the statement which is exposed .to my mind , i think that students must understand ideas and concepts ( absolutely ) because it s a way for them to mature , and also learn facts .on the one hand , when they understand ideas they can afford exposing their opinions .the best solution to it is to attend school because it s a good way to attend different types of class and to understand different things from each one .the fact of speaking with students can make one s view .going to school allow you to ask questions to professors if you do nt know something or do nt understand something .for example a student who used to believing that doctor kelly commited suicide and whose profesor explains him the real causes of his death will be more efficient after because he understands something .on the other hand it s really important on a student s life to learn facts .indeed , the best solution to learn facts is to be confronted by .you can read magazines , watch television , surf on the internet , in a word to put forward with times .when the unbelievable war in iraq was declared and when people seen all that happened in this country , they learned something : violence is not the best solution to solve a problem .besides , someone who is closed to his parents and does nt cope with the exterior will not be able to face situations and to leave the family nest , he will not stand on his own two feet .that s why he had to read , listen or everything else that can help him to know what happen in the world and in that way learn facts .anyway it s better if you are open-minded and not narrow-minded with the world s facts .to sum up understand ideas and concepts are as important as learn facts because it not ban you of having a different vision and opinion of things , and it allows you to create your own personnality .
