although both young and older people can live fascinated life , i think that young people enjoy life more than older people .this may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life , they are healthier , and finaly , they have less responsibilities .having a dreams and aims is one of the most things that makes young people more enjoyable of the life .young have many goals that they want to achieve , for example they want to achieve good education , high position .also , they dream with a wonderful wife/husband and happy life , and they exert their best efforts to achieve these dreams .expecting and anticipation of better future is a main source of happiness .some , may aruge that older people also have dreams and goals , but , in my opinion , they faced and experienced the real life which may be hard and disappointing .another factor is , health is very important to enjoy life .when you are in agood health , you can do any thing .you can do any effort you want , any kind of sport , any activity .illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy .when you are ill , you should take care of your health ; do should not do any hard activity , any excessive effors , and can do only some kinds of sports .you have to take care of times of different medicaments , and see the doctor regularly , and so on .moreover , less responsabilities help young to enjoy more their lifes .they always feel with secure and safe as they live their families .also , they know if they have problem , they can find persons to depend on , and to give them advice .they do not have to care about money , paying bills or preparing food .all they have to do is focusing on doing well on their education .to sum up , young enjoy life more than older people as they are more hopeful in a good life , healthier , and have less duties to do .
