according to my point of view , sucessful people try new things and are likely to take more risk .the main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal , he wants to have something new and more difficult to do .human beings are hardly satisfied and i ca nt help thinking that when somebody has succed in something , he will always want more .alpinists , for exemple , do nt usally stop climbing after they managed to reach their first summit .they always want to climb an other montain , harder and higher .napoleon s bonaparte , the french emperor and conquerant did nt stop going on war and facing battle until he was finaly defeated .and i think because he was sucessful in a first time , he could nt get rid of his will of power .an other reason would be the fact that sucessful people can start being bored by what they do , even if their activity matches success .so to avoid this phenomenon , they just start a new thing .we can find this kind of behaviour in sports .we can take the exemple of a great champion such as valentino rossi , who had won dozen of world championships .well , he is now looking forward to become a forula one driver .because he wants something new .something that gives him the opportunity to achive a other great goal .a last important factor is , according to me , the fact that when somebody managed to win something , or to earn something , he would probably want to get more of it .no matter if it is money , glory or power .the joy of winning might even be more important than the profit whitch came with this success .a good exemple would be a poker player or a gambler .after winning some money , they would probably bet more of it .and it is actualy dificult to get rid of this circle .
