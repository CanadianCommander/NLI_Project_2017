i agree with that statement .most people do nt think like that but i think thats true .there are many reasons why younger people enjoy life more .firstly , the best jears are over for them .the most of them have seen , done and lived anything so live has to offer no rising for them like it has for young people .the firts kiss for example is a very beautiful experiance for young people and thez get butterlys in their stomache while doing it but for old people it s onlz a normal process .the same is with getting the driver licens .young people ca nt wait to be 18 and get it and drive their own car .in compearance to that car driving is not as exiting for older people than for younger .secondly , young people can go out with frinds or go to the disco and dance all night long or go to a bar and drink something or someting like that , what old people can not do just becouse the most of their frinds are dead or to old so they can even not walk .furthermore , many old people live in  houses for old people  ( altersheimen ) .there they have the same process every day .they wake up at the same time , eat at the same time , go to toilet at the same time , wath tv at the same time and so on .that seems to be very boaring to me .life has to offer much more to young people .every day they make new and unknown experiences
