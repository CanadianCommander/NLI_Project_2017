some people like to travel alone , while others want to go travel with a guide .each has sevral pros and cons .however , i believe to enjoy traveling safe and effective , one should travel with a group of people led by a tour guide .that  because it is safer and a tour guide knows well about certain regions .first of all , traveling with a companion is much safer .no one denies that there are bobberies or dangerous accidents in famous spots .if a person faces a problems when going travel alone , it is greatly hard to solve it .however , with a group of people with a guide , one is likely to overcome angerous situations , because a tour guide may be aware of some difficulties in the country .for example , i went to a jeju island a yeas ago with my family .we had hard time to see a doctor because my sister got food poisoning .at that time we could cope with problems thanks to the guide s aid .if it were not for her help , my sister would have sicked during whole vacation period .we never forget her kindness and after that we become to go trip with a guide whenever traveling .on top of that , we can travel as many places as long as we are not tired .since tour guides are a professional of their region , they can recommand which places are good to see and which market sell product more cheap .these abilities help travelers to enjoy fully their vacation .to be specific , i went to east europe with a group of people , and we could go where we had looked forward to visit .that s because we notices this to a guide and guide made a perfect schedule .as a result , that travel is the best trip in my life .in addition , one can make friends with the help of a tour guide .most of tour guids are living where they are reponsibla to show and explain .therefore , they know many people living there .we have chance to meet indigenous people with a guide , this gives great pleasure to foreigners .of course , there are some negative aspects when traveling with a guide .however , positive effects are much more .in conclusion , i believe that traveling with a guide with a group of people is the best way to enjoy one s vacation .if i have a chance to on a trip , i would go abroad with a group which is led by a tour guide .
