risk to succeedsuccess is a path , not a situation ; so it needs skills for adjusting to the new circumstances , and more importantly creating own opportunities by taking risks .i also agree that successful people are different than the conservative ones ; because thay have a different view on trying and also the skills to accomplish their targets .of course risk taking does not mean to make stupid investments , but plan and coordinate everything .in every risk you take there is a chance of failure , but if you get afraid of failing you will also wo nt get successful .in chinese alphabet there are two icons for the risk concept .one of them is opportunity and the other one is loss .if you do nt take any risk you will never find the make benefits from an opportunity .john d. rockefeller who was one of the richest people of the world , once said : `` do not be afraid to give up the good to go for great  .he is considerated as a successor because of his attitude in risk taking .he cleverly saw the american s need in changing in transportation from railroad to the motorway and used his chance in creating the world s greatest oil company .people who are doing only they know , will mostly do one thing on their lives .maybe that will give them a more stable life with very low risk but they will never have to become very rich .i am a risk-lower myself ; and i try to look behind the scenes .because i know there is always an opportunity behind .because success is kind of a comparison
