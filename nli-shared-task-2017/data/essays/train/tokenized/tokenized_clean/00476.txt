after industrial revolution , there was a boost in the production of new staffs all over the wold .the revolution not only increased the speed of the production but also it opened a way for the variation .however there should be another innoation to exhibit these new products .at this point the advertisement concept came onto the stage .the advertisements have been using for introducing new products to consumers starting from that time .they are doing a good job for introducing new products to us .however i agree that most of them intoduce products much better that they realy are .first reason why i agree with the statement is that these advertisement companies should act in this way to be able to make profit which is the rule of capitalism world .the statemet is true in that these companies should show the products desirable to get new jobs from the other companies .however the introducton of new products in other way may result in disasters .for example , if one new food product is introduced as a healthy product , altough it is not a healthy product in real .this advertisement attempt would be resulted in death of a lot of people .the second reason is that the companies may not have enough time and procedures to differentiate between the good one and bad one .as a result they try to show them in the best way .the technological innovations helped them a lot in this concept .however there should be divisions in these companies to check the quality of productto be introduced .otherwise as i mentioned above the disasters for the human health would be unavoidable .in conlusion the advertisements usually shows products better with the ignorance of human health .
