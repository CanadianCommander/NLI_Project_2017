i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all , i think that the people today worry much more for the envioronment than in the past .the goverment and associations such as green peace try to get people involved to protect our planet and in my opinion their are achieving their purpouse .there are lots of people that go to work in bus and other public ways of transport , or share a car with other people to go to work every day .the governments in some countries are also trying to control the pollution by laws and restrictions such as not allowing to drive cars one day or another depending on the number plate .another fact that i think will influence on the decrease of the number of cars in use is their price and the price of gas .young people that start their first job do nt earn enough to buy a car and to pay for gas every month .i think the priority for them is to buy a house and since these are really expensive they do nt think about buying a car .on top of this , going by car to a big city is a huge waste of time because there is always a lot of traffic .for example , my friend ana has to leave home at half past seven in the morning to go to work , but she does nt start until nine oclock .after the hard day of work she leaves at half past six in the afternoon , but she does nt get home until eight oclock .she wastes three hours every day on the road !that is a lot of time and i think people are realising that is better to get the train because you know that you are always going to be on time and not wasting your day on the road .
