in this period , it s very important to try to do new things or new jobs because with the development of innovation there are less opportunities to become a successful person , and as a result only if you take some risks you will obtain some good results .a good example of this theory is bill gates , that has used the innovation to become the most important person in all the world and now he can do everything he wants .as far as i m concerned , i d like to have an idea like bill gates , because i m sure that this idea could be a solution to all my economic problems !!but i also believe that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspects but also with some problems , instead if you want to become a successful man , the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend , because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money .for instance , my father has done the same job for thirty years , and he has a very normal life , he helps me with the university s taxes and he has lot of friends , but he s too far to be a successful man .in spite of it s very difficult to be considered a successful person , there are lots of successful man in all the world , so i think that it s not impossibe to become an important man , but it s sure that if you do nt look for a new idea , you ca nt be considered like this one , so in conclusion i m agree with the statement .
