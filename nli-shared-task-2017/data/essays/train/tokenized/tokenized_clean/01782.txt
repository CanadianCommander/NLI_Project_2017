i agree with the statement .young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because time is changed .with the grow of the population and the expansion of the cities the ideal of communities is different .in the past people live togheter coperating , so young people could give an hand and a contribute to the society , but now there is an individualism society .so young people do nt feel the need of helping their communities .i think that young peole must know how important is give an hand to someone that need help .everyone must give his little contribute for the growing of the society .personally i spend some of my time to help children of primary school with their homeworks , because i think that it s an important think to do .during my summer holidays for a month my friends and i do the animation at the youth club , playing with children , taking them at the swimming pool , and making some mountain trips .children s parents always thank us for our usefull service because without us they do nt know what can do .also childern seems to be happy for these activities .this is an example that with a little sacrifice everyone can give an hand to the community in particulary young people .i think that the best solution is to incentivate young people to make some activities , for examples help old people or children .in this way the communitie will grow b
