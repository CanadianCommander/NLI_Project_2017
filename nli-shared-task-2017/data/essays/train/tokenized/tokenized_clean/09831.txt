nowadays , you can find many people who have an amazing amount of knowledge .but some people seem to be an expert on every subject .it appears to be that not many people really know something about a certain subject , but without real experts , our industrial word would not work .experts are obviously needed to receive true and exact information about a theme .but if you want to know , for instance , something about a complex problem in the process of a dna syntheses , you need someone who learned about that all his studying time !to avoid misunderstandings of very popular themes , like biotechnique , you need to have clear and verifyed information .if everybody knows a little bit , this puzzle will not end up in a clear picture , but in chaos of incomplete or even wrong information .but , of course , experts are needed in the industry to create an effective team .for example , to build a house , you need a mathematics expert , a resources expert and so on .they all match together to a perfect team , which now is able to create new ideas , which work .maybe the head of the team could be someone with a broader knowledge , but , however , his function in the team is to be an expert of organisation .i am aware of the problem , that if someone is an expert of a certain subject , but does not know anything of the rest of the world , it can come to problems , even dangerous ones .if a doctor does not know anything about politics and the democratic system we live in , he/she could make dramatically wrong decisions .he/she would not understand the values and the social environemet we live in .to prevent that , a state needs very good schools , which every citzin has to go to , while he is a child and a young man/woman .this school should teach him/her all the neccessary basic knowledge .concluding , i would say , that our world urgently needs experts , who know about their subject very well , in order to accomplish all tasks our society comes up with .good grammar schools must garranty that every citzin understands the basic structure of our society .
