in todays modern and fast moving world , `` jack of all and master of none  , dosnt work at all .people needs to be more focussed on a subject or two , to really master it and become expert of it .this , one subject appraoch , can help students to spend plenty of time to learn its basics clearly , during their early days .it also helps them to stay more focussed on the suject of their liking .moreover , once they become a subject expert , they can really harness their mastery over the subject , by doing consultancy projects , which can help them build , a satisfactory and rewarding career .on other hand , many subject approach , despite of small short term advantages has nothing much to offer in the students long term career .first , to have a vast knowledge of many subjects , one needs to devote time for all for them , proportinally .this is quite not possible in todays fast moving world , as students get limited time to study in thier busy routines .on the other hand , having just one subject at their hands can really help them to spend plenty of time for preparing and building the basics of thier favourite subject .second , taking large number of subjects can be a big disturbance sometimes .when somebody liks one particular subject the most , he or she doesnt have to spend unnecessary time in reading and understanding the other subjects .in one subject appraoch , one can really concentrate and focus on one subject of his liking .for example , if a student likes science more than the others , he can go really deep into it , instead if spending time in history or economics class .finally , having mastered one particular subject in great detail , make that person expert of it .he or she can take up the job of consultancy later on in their life .for example a person who is expert in fluid dynamics can help companies overcome their flow problems , using the vast knowledge he has gained in the subject .as a result it can be really rewarding , as salaries of this people or so called subject experts will be sky high .on the other hand as a jack of all and master of none kind of person , one can only do a superficial analysis of the problem , as he or she has limited knowledge of the subject .to summarize , developing a specialization in one particular subject can be really intresting and exciting .students can save lots of their time in understanding their favourite subject instead of spending time on toatlly unrelated material .moreover , one subect appraoch helps a student to become a subject expert which can be again really rewarding and challenging experience .
