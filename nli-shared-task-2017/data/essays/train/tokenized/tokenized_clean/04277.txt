i completely agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .the following reasons explain better my opinion .i think that understand ideas and concepts presents some advantages .in fact , if you learn the fact but you do not understand the concept behind the fact , probably after no many time you will not remember the fact yet .insteed , if you really understand the concepts , in your future probably you will not remember the specific fact but you will remember the most important ideas of the argument .so , you have to learn facts only after you understand concept .the fact that students do not understand concepts has two different causes first , usually in the exam student has to explain only the facts ; so learn only the facts is easier than understand the concepts .then , i think that to understand the basical ideas students need a really good professor , because it is difficult to understand them by textbook .finally , i believe that if you really understand the concepts behind the facts , you can put them in practice better .if you learn only the facts , you can nottherefore i think that you can understand why i believe that students first have to understand the concepts and the ideas , and then the facts .in conclusion , i think that this statements is true not only for students , but for everyone in general .usually it has more value for a student , but it is a right statement for everyone because i think that it is alvways better , in every situation , understand the concepts than the details .
