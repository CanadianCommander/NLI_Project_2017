generally i agree with the statement .understanding ideas and concepts is exactly what you need when you finished university and when you are going to work for a company .there are some facts you have to know but it is definitly more important to understand concepts and ideas .if you are a business student and you learn something about the product life cycle for example , you definitly have to understand how the cycle works ( the main idea of the cycle ) when you start a job in a marketing agency .if your new boss or supervisor sees , that you understand the idea of the cycle and that you know how a certain product performs in the market , he will be glad to have you in his team .but if you would nt remember this concept at all , although you learnd it in university , your new boss would ask himself if he maybe made a mistake by employing you .if you just forget the correct names of all the stages of the cycle ( the facts ) , he would probably not even notice it .and if , you could easily find the answer in a book or in the internet .but remember that it is impossible to understand the whole idea or concept but just looking it up in the internet quickly !of course it is also important for all students to know some facts .for instance a doctor must know the different indications between a little injury and a double-broken bone and a lawyer must have a really broad knowledge of the most common laws .but in my opinion the main reason why students go to university is that they need to learn to connect the given facts .no-one can be a lawyer by simply knowing all the laws , he must have the ability to connect the given information ( laws ) with the different opportunities to use them .he must have a concept .he will use a law-book with all the facts to help him , but he goes to university to learn what to do with the law-book .
