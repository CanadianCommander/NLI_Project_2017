each person has his own way to enjoy his life .some peeple think that young people use thier time more funny than the adults , while others think that the age does nt make any connection with enjoying life for people .personally , i think that the age is nt the only factor to check the enjoying life quality .among many factors that help people enjoy their life , the first factor is a hobby .having hobbies makes people use their time useful .i have one friend who has a hobby , making pro-models .if he had spare time , he would go to pro-model shop .he actually likes that kind of making .so , i ve never seen that he wastes thier spare time useless .i think he know how to enjoy his life by his own way .another factor is a friend .from kindergarten s time on , people usually spend thier time with their friends .with friends , we did our homework , played outdoors , and struggled with them .we ca nt imagine the life without our friends .this means having how good friends help people to enjoy their life more .i have a good friend .he seems like he always prepares funny time with me and our other friends to me .if he were nt exist with me , i would get stuck in boredsome .whenever we have spare time , he schedules a tour plan and watching movies and sports game .thanks to him , i doubt that i actually enjoy my life more than others .lastly , having more information make us enjoy our life more .without any information , we ca nt enjoy our life .even though , there are many things to enjoy , if we do nt know these things are in vain .this means we need to get more information in order to enjoy life .i usually read the megazine which has a information of space of trip or famous tour places .by using it , i can get many chances to take a trip to the place for which i ve ever heard been .in our nation , i could travel many unque islands that many people could nt get reached .to sum up , i think that there are many factors that could help people to enjoy their life more .apparently the age is a kind of fator , but having hobby , having good friends , and having more information also important factors .
