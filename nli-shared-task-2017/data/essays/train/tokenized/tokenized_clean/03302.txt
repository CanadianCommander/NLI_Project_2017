nowadays , students can use all ways to success in their fields but they have to make attention in order to use the efficient way .that s why i am completely aggree with this statement  it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn .actually , i think understanding ideas and concepts is more helpfull for students because this way is reliable , it help you to save your time and your memory will work successfully .the first thing is understanding ideas and concepts is really reliable .actually , in order to do a good job at your exam , you have to understand the differents ideas .moroever , this process is the first step in the method to learn facts .for example , a student who learns only facts ca nt have good grades because during his exam , he can not understand the main ideas , so he will easily fail .furthermore , this method to understand ideas can also help you to save your time in your daily life .the second thing which makes my opinion on this statement is the fact that this process can save your time .actually , it can save your time because it will take less time to understand the main ideas of a lecture than to learn something you definetly do nt understand .for example , you can use more than three hours to learn facts but if you just try to understand what this lecture is talking about , you will know easily how this process is efficient .thus , you will gain time to do other thing because you did nt spent a lot of time to catch the main ideas of the lecture .furthermore , this process can help your memory to work with more success .actually , your memory will work successfully , because you will help your memory to save only the important things .thus , you will help your memory to be selective and to work faster than before .moreover , you will help your memory to react very fast in front of a situation unexpected .in doing so undestanding ideas is better than learn factsin conclusion , i am definetly agree with this statement .i hope all students will use this method in order to have good grades and reach their goals easily .
