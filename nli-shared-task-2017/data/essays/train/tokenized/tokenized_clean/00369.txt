i am not sure wether adolescent or older people are the happier ones since i am myself in my early twenties .on the one hand , young people seem to be much more energetic and are certainly physically more vital and attractive .therefore they spend more time for social purposes , for instance going to parties , which could lead to the assumption that they are enjoying life more .but as older people usually already found their match , this aspect of going out at night is not relevant to them .after a divorce it is likely to observe that they change their nightlife behaviour again and become more active again because they need a substitute for their former partner , which implies that the age is not solely responsible for the intensity someone lives with .additionally to this argument , older ones probably do not enjoy life less than young , they only have other interests that are perhaps less observable .may be they value more passive activities like reading books and being intellectual more than during their childhood , which does not imply that they are less satisfied with their lives .another point that would support the thesis is that children are relatively sorrowless .as they grow up they start think about problems increasingly .i this tendency continues , older people are concerned about a lot of issues that an adolescent would never think of .for example , a twenty year is certainly not dealing with the problem of near death or the challenge of raising a child .on the other hand , this could be a reason for older people to enjoy life more actively and intensively , since they feel that they will not life forever .summarized , i can not give a clear statement that i am a hundred percent sure of .in my opinion , every part of our lives offers opportunities and challenges us with its own problems .it is up to each individual how it deals with it and how it perceives the advantages and disadvantages of the distinct live phases in order to become a happy human being .
