in modern era , people are getting more and more involved in their personal matters to such an extent that they can not spare time for other social obligations .young generation , particularly focusses on its own interests disregarding the needs and problems of their communities as a whole .i agree with the statement made by the author and substantiate my decision as follows .the concept of `` individualism  has encompassed almost every corner and section of society .people are preoccupied by the thought `` survival of the fittest  .that is why they are more focussed on their own personal lives and dont care for their community as a whole .this is supported by the fact that whenever funds are granted for the upliftment of a particular community , people who are involved in such dealings tend to get maximum aid for themselves remaining unconcerned about the others in the community .also in today s world everyone is flooded with the works and responsibilities one has to perform .this leaves no room in their thought for such help to upbring their community .their hectic schedule doesnot leave them with enough spare time .so they dont get enough time for considering concerns of their communities .moreover , these days the thinking of people have broadened and they donot want to give an edge to a community , no matter if that community is their own .they believe in sense of competition and unbiased selection .they believe in dignity of hard work and want justice to prevail among the society .but one must admit as well , many associations which favor the improvement of a community as a whole are still present in fair numbers and are active .most of these associations are run by people who have been successful in life and want to provide opportunities to other members of their community .most of them comprise of donations , gifts and reservations for the members of their respective communitiesin sum , despite of some exceptions the young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities and are more concerned with their daily responsibilities and obligations .
