i strongly agree with this statement : it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i have strong experiene that can support the reason of my opinion .i agree of this statement because of two reasons below .first , without processing of understanding , we can not say that we know facts .when i was a high school student , there is the teacher who famous for hasitating for student s question .he tought national history , he always tought us as book says like copy the book .when i questioned about this subject , i could not satisfy of his answer .he seems to do not know well about his subject , and i do not think he understand perfectly of his subject .he just knew and tought only fact .espetially the national history class requires `` understanding  , not `` fact  , because of him , i still do not know about my conutry s history entirely .second , there is a virtue that `` knowing one , knowing ten  it means when we understand one thing perfectly , we can know nine thing related with it additionaly .few days ago , my one of friends asked me about concept of market .i answered to her as i learned from book , and she also knew that concept .but she need to know it profoundly .so we started to study about it researching internet , reading books related with it .eventually we could understand perfectly , as understanding it , i can understand till another concept of marketing easily .because of two reasons , i agree with this statement : it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than ut us for them to learn facts .thesedays , we can learn about everything easily through the internet .we need attitude that think about one thing deeply rather than passing with just its fact .
