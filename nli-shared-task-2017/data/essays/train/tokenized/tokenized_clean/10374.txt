i would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people .there are two reasons : physical strength and sensitive feeling .to begin with , the phsical strength is necessary to enjoy life .for example , if people go to the other country for travel , they have to carry the heavy baggage in which all equipments for travel install .generally speaking , it is easier for young people to complete , as compared as older people .additionally if they could not carry heavy baggage like older people , the areas where they could go is limited or they have to pay money to make someone carry .older people will not go around .because they have the phsical strengh .therefore , young people enjoy to travel in the other country , even though they have to move with their heavy baggage .in the second place , the sensitive feeling will lead to enjoy life .if people face any arts , such as pictures , music , paintings , they will able to obsorb in their sensitive feeling .for example , gradually they are deeply interested in music and they would like to learn and play instruments .in my opinion , young people have the sensitive feeling which is need for playing instruments , as compared as older people .on the other hand , it will be clear for older people that the sensitive feeling will be decreased when they start learning instruments .that s why , young people enjoy life to face or learn any arts .as a result , i would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people , as thinking about the physical strength and the sensitive feeling .
