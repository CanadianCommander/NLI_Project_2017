first of all , let me ask you about this quetion .would you like more cars or not ?are nt you aware about the severe air pollution problem ?do nt you get embarrassed when passing in a speed of 10km/h in crowded area ?in twenty years , less cars will be in use than now .actually , i used to dream these kind of cases when i ve been involded in environmental friendly social services .our goals were to advertise the air pollution of cars and encouraging people to use public transport .by that time , i sometimes had that feeling one day , cars should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly .likewise , the place i m living now singapore is the very country which succeed in reducing the number of cars .the high taxes included in the purchase disgust the buyers  taste of getting a new car .not only the tax included in the buying process but taxes such as erp , those which are paid when cars are passing the city area , are having great success in making people using less cars .this morning , i read on the internet newspaper about one very special item ; the flying car m-400 .this car has been put on ebay as an ` on sold  item and the price predicted was about 4000 millions us $ .it also included that this kind of cars will perhaps be more popular in about 20 years , and be the time 20 years pass , i think scientists and engineers will be able to find a new kind of sources as replacement of fuel .well , it s truth that people have already started to use gas using cars or even cars with engines using oxygens .no one knows what will happen in 20 years .but considering the current ways people think about pollution and the fact that science is still developing , i prefer voting my part to the one agreeing at the statement .franckly said , at the time i was born , personal mobile phones were predicted to come out in about 30 years which we actually made it within 15 years .
