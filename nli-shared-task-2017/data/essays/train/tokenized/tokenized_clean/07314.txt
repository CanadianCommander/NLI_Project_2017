here i want to sight a quotation that `` who dares wins  .i feel that successful people are those people who have taken risk to do well in their respective fields or taken a risk of choosing a new field to succeed .i feel that no proffession or venture of human is risk free .for example if a man have money to invest , he should risk to invest the money in a new bussiness or even shares of some reputed companies .if he does not take this risk to invest in one field or other , his money may loose it s value after some period .if this risk turns to be fruitful , we can say that the risk the man taken succeeded .we can also say that the man is a successful man .if a man goes on doing the same work he knows how to do well sometime or the other he will feel life to be boredom .so taking risk makes man to live lively .if our premature man have not taken the risk of finding fire , we might be eating the same raw meat and uncooked food .if they have not taken the risk of hunting animals in those days the human race that we see now may not be existing .if scientists have not taken the risk of spending their time or brain on inventing new things , we may not be in this developed world of high scientifisc adavancement .in medicine field if the then doctors has not taken the risk to operate a person by surgery many diseases or injuries of little importance now might still be lethal to human life causing many deaths .all the recent advances in the automobiles or aeroplanes is because of risk that was taken by our forefathers in developing them .i feel that all the knowledge that we enjoy now in any field like space research or medicine is because of the risks that were taken by one or the other .so in my opinion no proffession is risk free and there is no existance of this world if no one takes risk .
