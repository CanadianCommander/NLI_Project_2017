in my opinion , succcesful people try to new things while they are with many mistakes , and they will keep until it will be success what they want to make somothing .for example , egyison tohmas who made a electolonic things .he is familier with everyone and he is popular person for successful .so i agree with successful people try new things and take risks .there are two reasons .one reason is seccess and failuer are conected always .when i learn cooking first time .i could nt cook anything even though just cut foods , at that time i cut my hands , yet when i cooked a food second times , it was a success .another reasons is try new things are discover somthing new ever i have nt knew things .i like to know new things and i do nt care what kind of risks .thus i think it is important to try new things and take risks for successful people .
