according to my opinion , schools should be the places where students are thought and made understood the ideas and concepts .the ideas and concepts should be explained to them clearly and then the student should be made to think on them .when they think .they are going to internalise the ideas and concepts and they are going to see their reflections in their daily lives .i think that , only teaching facts to the students , make them lose the main point of the subject .in other words , teaching facts about a subject in a class , not making students understand the vital parts of the concepts or ideas first , is just like saying the first word that must be kept until the end .i think that this makes the whole illusion and the interest to the subject disappear .of course facts must be thought to the students later , after explaining the ideas and concepts clearly in detail .in addition , i think that understanding the concepts and ideas , affects the ceativity of students in a positive way .this allows students to think on the subject and generate their own ideas about the concepts .teaching facts and demanding these from student as a feedback in the examinatins or what else , makes students memorize the materials and show them without any comment .in conclusion , i agree that it more is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts .i do not ignore the importance of teaching facts , but i believe that in an education system , it should come after understanding the concepts .
