i would disgree with this statment having the broad knowledge of many acaemics subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because everyone would have their own choice of subject , so they prefer to be specialised in that particular subject .notonly that many of the students would have grip over particular subject .it becomes difficult for the student to understand the unfamilier subject it would distracts them from their regular courses .for an example if we consider the undergraduated student who have undergone his studies practicular field of subject such as computersciences , communications etc .these undergraduted students who undergone specific courses would prefer to take specialisation in particular subject since they have know about the subject .if the student of computers would prefer to the broad knowledge about the electronics then that student face a problem because that would be the unfamilier subject , where he have to learn basics this would distracts him from his regular course .if we prefer to be specialised in the particular subject of our intertest then we could learn more about the subject i.e from basics to the recent developments .we would may much attention towards the subject and also shows much enthusiasm in that specific subject because it is the subject of our interest .knowing everything about particular subject is better .
