i disagree with this statement as we can see the incerease in traffic day to day .if we see the graph drawn between number of vechiles on the road year wise , we can see the increase rapidly .this shows how the people are using the vechiles .nowadays we can see every family owns a car and it has become a must-have thing .most of the people use their cars to go to the offices or work place , and you can use your own car to travel to different places instead of hiring a cab .the cost of cars have come down in recent years making it easy for common people to buy them and most banks and financial institutes provide different schemes to purchase a car .through these schemes most of the middle class families buy a car for their personal use .if you own a car , you need not worry in a emergency situations like calling the ambulance for sudden health problems of family members .the other reason is if a family is planing to go on a vacation to a different state , they can use their own vechile instead of hiring a cab .they can move around the city and go to any place they wish to .if they have their own vechile they wo nt be any problem for a late night party .they wo nt have any problem look for a cab in the late night to get back home .and as resale markets have come up , people sell their old cars for a new one .i strongly belive that in the next 20 years , there would be double the amount of cars you find right now on the road .every common person use the car for all his activites like goign to the park in the morning , goign to his office or work place , and goign to a late night party , and going out for shopping of household things etc .so i disagree with the statemen that they would be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
