there is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reasons .firstly , it is getting expensive to own and use a car .scarcity has driven the prices for oil and the raw materials for manufacturing of cars up to an almost unacceptable level .also , car usage adds onto the already serious air pollution and global warming problems with their exhaust .the economical and environmental reasons encourage people to switch to a cheaper and cleaner mode of transportation - the mass transportation .however , i believe that there will not be significantly fewer cars in use twenty years from now on .firstly , with the rise of many third world countries such as china and india , many more individuals will be able to replace their cheaper vehecles , such as bicycles and motorcycles , with cars .not only because of the luxury , they will be able to travel to further places more frequently .economic advancements also encourage researches on greener energy .in the future , cars with inbuilt solar panels may become the major vehicles on the road .besides using solar energy , a greener way of travelling can also be achieved with reduction in car sizes .there may be options varying from one seat personal cars to six seats family mini vans .the lack of metals for car manufacturing can also be solved with technology .researches on strong materials such as carbon nanotubes may serve to replace today s steel sheets .cars , just as many other items we have in modern lifestyle , provides us with tremendous convenience .yet , they bring about problems that may one day lower our quality of life .however , instead of escaping , we should confront the problems with better solutions .hence , there will be more cars instead of fewer , just greener and smaller , twenty years later .
