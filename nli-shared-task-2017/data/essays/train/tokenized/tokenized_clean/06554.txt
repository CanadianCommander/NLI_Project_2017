`` technology has always been a boon to the society  , due to advancement in technology there are smaller and efficient ways to finish a particular task .the population growth of the cars has also been a major part of concern .we are striving hard enough to meet the requiremnts of todays world .so , i feel that twenty years down the line we may have very fewer cars on the roads .in twenty years from now technology will be so advanced that person can work efficiently sitting at home or being online , so there is not much to travel and work at the same time .nowadays people are looking for luxury and work together .they do not want themselves to stress a lot but , at the same time work harder and efficiently .think of people during ancient times , they were happy and contented with the work and efforts they used to put in at that time , but now the scenario is different people are looking towards the world with a broder perspective , they want to gain more and put less .they do not want to sit ideal but also do not want to stress themselves .with the growth in population , competition is increasing rapidly and people are looking focused towards their work .they prefer to work more and gain more but , with ease .people will be getting stuff ready at their doorstep and thus there does not arise a need to travel through cars and waste time as time is precious .cars are polluting the city heavily nowadays and so i feel that the government will provide other means of transport twenty years from now and ban cars .may be this step will help us to get a healthy and pure environment .thus , one can mearly suggest that the rate of cars twenty years from now will surely decrease .some other means of transport may arise which will help to secure and improve the environment .there will also be a lot of advancement in technology which will help us to achieve this .
