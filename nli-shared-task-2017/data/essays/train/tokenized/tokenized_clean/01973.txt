i firmly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .in my country , it is the biggest problem that young people do not want to volunteer their communities .they just give their time to study or get a good job .my country has a programm that give some points to teenager who help their communities .at first , it was successful because every young adults attended this programm .however , after 1990 , education programm was changed so students did not want to join community activity at all .so it changes a duty of students .soon , it changed the hatest programm to young adults .they attend communities  programm just for get a points , not in serious .according to this situation , i can feel that nowadays  young people do not want to help their villages .also , all communities in my country are helped by adults .if young people who live in my town want to join the town club to help their community , they will depressed because club president will not admit them .my communitiy has strange custom that club member s age have to over than 30-year-old .it is unfair to young people but adults still keep this custom .it makes teenager to do not have attention to their communities .in addition , there are several researches support an important reasons that young people did not attention to their communities .accoridng the famous scientist team in my country asserts that nowadays  young people are shy and not out-goint than 30 years ago , so they do not show their opinion to others .because of young people s personalities , communities are helped by only adults .although there are countries that totally different from my country .however , countries which are located in eastern world have similarity of this trend .therefore , i claims that young people do not give enough time to helping their societies .
