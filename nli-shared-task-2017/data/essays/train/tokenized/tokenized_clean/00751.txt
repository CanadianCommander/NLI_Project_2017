nowaday , the number of advertisements on tv , radio and internet and newspapers is increasing .in addition , we often see a lot of advertisements .some of people accept the advertisement , that you see easily .but some of them hate it .because most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first , i am going tell you about food in advertisements .the food , that we watch on tv , is more better than they really are .there are a white fogs and moving something and other good food in addition to the food on tv .that things make you feel that you want to eat that food .but acutually if you eat them , you would get mad against the cooker .secondly , the house in advertisement on newspaper .the houses in the picuture is great in newspaper .they are clean and big and so on .in addition , the background of the house is very beautiful in only newspapers .for example , when i was in japan , i had a habbit .the habbit is to see some newspaper .then i found the very great and beautiful house .there were near to my house .so i went there to see it .but it was different from the house in the newspaper strongly .thus , the products that advert is very different from real product
