actually , for some points i agree with the statement , and for some points i do nt .because , in my opinion , ` ideas and concepts  and ` facts  are two interrelated issues that can not be seperated .i will explain this statement with some examples .for instance , we can think about history .in history , there are many facts which had also results that affected the world in a positive or negative way .from a closer past , the war in iraq will be a good example for a fact .of course , there are ideas and concepts behind this war , however , ` the actual war  which is occuring has more significance .if we are aware of this fact , if we know it , we can do something to stop it .ideas and concepts that will be thought as solutions , come after this realization of the situation .another example for history will be the agreements , negotiations between different countries .these are facts to be known because they them are made at a specific time and some of them come to the present day .as another example , from a different field , we can consider art and architecture .both of these areas create artifacts , art products .but beyond that , they produce ` concepts  , ` ideas  and use the intellectual background of an individual ( trying to mean the artist , or the architect ) .so , what affects an individual ?the medium that he/she comes from , the different thoughts of philosophers , thinkers he / she pursued .for instance , we can think about leonardo da vinci or michel foucault , or frank llyod wright , or zaha hadid , and so on . ..still , professionals are discussing their ` facts  , which i understand as their art objects , books , or artifacts .the purpose of these discussions is to figure out the main idea , the concept of the people .having any idea about these people leads them , encourages them to find out their own conceptual capacities .in the light of these two examples from different fields , i want to emphasize that understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts have both equal importance for the students .they are not free from each other , rather , they both depend on and affect each other .a new idea comes from knowing the facts - and others  opinions as well , and facts are results of specific ideas and concepts .
