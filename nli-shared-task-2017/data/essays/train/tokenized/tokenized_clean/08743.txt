in this short response first of all i will explain what i think about this sort of behaviour , then , supported by personal examples i will state if i agree or not with this statement .most of successful people i think they are strongly ambitious and owner of great expectations from their lifes .this is mainly due to their conditions : they achieved lots of goals and intrinsic and extrinsic satisfactions .well , once reached such a `` high `` point of their lifes they do not seem to want to stop and they keep on trying new risks and getting new challenges as if everything they achieved it is not sufficient .personally i ca nt have an exact opinion because i can not consider myself a successful person and neither a person who is taking new risks .i just can suppose what i would do if i could be the subject in the statement .first of all i strongly believe that this decisions depends on personalities and types of people .for example a brilliant and successful young man is supposed to continue his career taking more risks than a collegue who has a family and hence can not permit to expose himself to great risks .it is also true that an adult who only has a great goal probably will not continue to try for harder and higher goals .the behaviour in the statement has a negative effect too : as the past experience of everyone can teach , in a risky business no one knows the result , so it can be negative for most successfull people too , although they seem the most suitable persons to hold a challenge .to me it would be right to reach a satisfying status of living , which confers to me sufficient both extrinsic and intrinsic satisfaction .with this i mean that people should not exceed and overrate their capabilities trying new things .of course i have and i will always have goals but i do not consider myself a `` risk ~ friendly `` person .i think it is more satisfyng to do greatly a single task than two in an approssimative way .obviously this is why i wrote that it depends on personal behaviour at the beginning .
