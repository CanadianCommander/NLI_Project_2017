i disagree with the statement which says , `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .the following reasons will support my opinion .first of all , when you get to travel in a group , you always have to move with the group , which means you ca nt schedule your own course where you want to drop by during your trip .you might go to only the places which you did nt expected to go .for example , i was on a trip to japan .me and my friend scheduled everyplace we wanted to visit for 2 weeks .it taked a bit of time to get those imformation but it was worth it .suppose i travel in a group with a tour guide and miss the premiere leage , the english soccer leage , eventhough i m travelling england becuase it s mot scheduled .that will be terrible for me .secondly , if there is a tour guide he might tell you all the imformation about all the places and stuff .it could be good for some people but i think studying about places you go , cultures neer it , learning history is all part of the trip .if you do nt study about the place your visiting you might not understand their culture and old stuff eventhough someone like a tour guide explains you everything .because i think studying about the places is very exciting and essential for making my schedules and plans for my trip , i wo nt need a tour guide .also , if you are in a group you wo nt even get your enough free time in your trip because you ll have to move on all the time with your group .i think this problem is one of the most important problem in a trip .i think a travel has too make your stress dissappear , but when you have to move when you do nt want to , it ll make you more stressful .when i visited india with my friend , we rested and read books in our hotel for a day .somepeople might think it s a waste of money and time but i think it s the best part of travelling .however , these are the reasons why i think travelling with a tour guide in a group seems terrible to me .i think studying about our own destination , resting there and scheduling the whole travel by myself is the most important things in my tour .
