the statement agreeing with having a broad knowledge and not a subject-specified knowledge is to one extent wrong .having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects might be a positive thing but in the end there is the need of some kind of specialization in order to achieve and get some results .during the years of formation ( middle and high school ) a range of subjects is needed in order to give the student a chance to get a better idea on where they want to specify later on in their lives .but once school is over some kind of specialization needs to be required .children and teenagers are required to learn no many subjects not because it is better to have a broader knowledge but because they are not old enough to choose which specialized subject they want to pursue .having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is the same as having shallow knowledge on something .with this shallow knowledge no results can be achieved and the result , in the end , is someone that knows a little about everything and nothing about something specific .engineers , doctors , lawyers are all specialized in their on subject .this professions that are the most respected ones are based on specific knowledge and not on broad knowledge .there is no time or real need for a doctor to know about law and how the judicial system works as long as he knows about his own profession and how to apply medicine .there is something called general culture that everyone should learn and use in every day basis but it should not be the only knowledge a person has .the general culture should be accompanied by some kind of specified knowledge on something that would lead to something .people that only have general culture do not have enough knowledge to pursue a carreer that would lead somewhere in the future .the nobel prizes , for example , are subject-specified and there is no general culture nobel prize .the physicist that earns the physics nobel prize has specified knowledge that accompanied with research and work in this subject led him to a discovery .in the end , what is needed in the world of today is a general sense of what is going in the world ( i.e. general culture ) with some specified knowledge in a subject that might lead to an achievement that would help the world in general .having only specified knowledge is also a negative thing because there is a dettachment of the real world that could harm a person and disconect him from the world .
