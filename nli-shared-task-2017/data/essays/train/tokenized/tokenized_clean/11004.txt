to predict what will happen in twenty years from now is a hard thing to do .however , i must say that i disagree with the statement that states that in twenty years there will be fewer cars then there are today .i disagree for many reason i find reasonable .everyday our world changes in a way or another .we experience changes in the world and those changes can affect us in various ways .because the world has changed radically over the past hundred years more jobs are provided and more people are getting really involved with this development .as a result , speed became a very important matter in an individual s life .since , more work is needed to be accomplished by an individual now than it probably was before and in a shorter amount of time , an individual might find himself or herself in need for shortcuts and methods than makes his or her life easier .when we go to our jobs or schools or anywhere else we usually try to save time and reach there as quickly as possible .the most popular method of doing that is driving a vehicle or being driven in a vehicle .more and more people are finding themselves in great need of a car .in some families , more than just one car is neccessary .so , if you go into a house of a family consisting of six members for example , you will most probably find two cars or even more .in some families both the parents could have jobs and therefore , each one of them needs his or her own car .another reason is that people have more chances of buying a car or even more today , which is because so many car companies make it easy for customers .those companies allow customers to pay only a part of the price of a car throughout a specified period of time .with people getting busier by the day and chances of buying a car increasing , and speed becoming such a vital thing , i believe that in the next twenty years cars will not only not decrease , but they will increase and the numbers of cars will sore .
