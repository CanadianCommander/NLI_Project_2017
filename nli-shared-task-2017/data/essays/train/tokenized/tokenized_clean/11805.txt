enjoy life while you are still young - this is the programmatic statement of youth culture .it builds on the general believe that young people enjoy life more than seniors .but i do not think that younger people enjoy life more than older people .examining the question along three dimensions of joy - social interaction or friendship , physical condition or health and a person s own perception or his or her mental attitude towards joy - will show that both , younger and older people do enjoy life .a first important dimension on which a person s enjoyment of life could me measured is the degree of his or her social interaction .as homan beings are ` social animals  , satisfying social interaction is vital to them .this is why circle of friends and relatives as well as satisfying interaction is necessary for a person to enjoy life .young people certainly spend a lot time with their friends or partner .enrolled in university or work they have a lot of possibilities to meet new people and to communicate to a large number of different individuals .older people on the other hand often have more limited social interactions .their ciricle of friends and relatives might have reduced over time , the do not have the opportunity to meet people at work and partners often have already passed away .yet , older people often have deeper , more valuable relationships with their social circle : friendships that have been shape over a long time replace in quality the larger social network younger people have , as there social networks are often of less quality .a second important aspect for an individual s joy in life is his or her physical condition and the ability to be versatile and take part in acitivities resulting from it .surely young people have by far a health advantage over older people .and they are not only fit and healthy but normally also in good condition that allows them to do `` fun activities  like snowboarding or surfing .but on the other hand , seniors are not completely banned from satisfying physical activities by their somewhat worse physical condition .many older people nowdays enjoy a great varity of senior sports that actually provide lots of joy and happiness to them .last but perhabs even most important for a persons happiness and joy in life is the persons mental status and attitude against joy .it s the simple question if a person feels happy and takes time to enjoy life .while youngs people are often stressed and too much in a hurry to actually enjoy what they are doing , older people take their time to enjoy what they have lived and still can live in life .this is why = even though seniors might be limited in their sources of joy - they are often even happier than young people .to summarize , i think that both young and old people can enjoy life by the same degree .it is more in the way that these two groups injoy life =
