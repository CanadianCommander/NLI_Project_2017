some people in the world , may be in poor countries dislike to understand ideas and concepts , but they prefer to learn facts .i do nt agree with this statement , because the real sense of the life is in the facts .for example :it is more important for a fisher understand how find a fish , or it is more important for he swim in the rivers or sea and became to know how is phylosophy of fish , i think the fisher should be firts a good swimer , and he only will obtain good results in his work with practice , with facts .but it is also important understand ideas of how working the things , because if we do not study first the world can not know the facts .for example , the same fisher will obtain best results in his work , if he first will study how is the behavior of the fishes , in which kind of water , the fishes grown faster .other example , the farmers cultivated a lot of years ago , without our tecnology and knowlodge .how did they cultivate it ?there is a only answer , with facts , with practice .so , if the farmers cultivated with more ideas , with more knowledge , theirs results will be best .how did child learn to speak ?he do not learn with to understand ideas and concepts , he learn with facts .in the progress countries , there are some people thinking that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in conclussion , it is more importand for students learn facts , practice for learn , because this can use for them in their countries .
