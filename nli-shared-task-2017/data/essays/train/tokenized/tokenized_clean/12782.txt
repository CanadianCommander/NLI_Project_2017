in my opinion , for students it is more important understand the ideas and concepts than just learn the facts .the advantages of understand the ideas and concept is that it is hard to forget , and easy to use .if i lean someting deeply and understand the ideas , i would remember that forever .in additon , if i see something which is similar or different thing but contain the same concept , i can straigh understand it and use it .for example , i learned accounting when i was in a first year senior high school studend , eventough i only did it for a year , but i fully understand all the concepts .aferter i go to university , i restarted to study accounting , eventhough i learned that two years ago , but i still remember most of the things .that helps me save a lot of time , and have extra time to study other subjects .on the other hand , if i just lean something without understanding it , it would be easier to lean and i do not have to spend a lot of time to undersand it .for instance , once i was prepairing the history test , there was not much time , so i just remember it without understander how did everything happen .at the time , i pass the test , but for the final exam , i have to study that again , because i can not remember anythins at all .in summary , i think students go to school for learning something to improve our life .futhermore , to extend our knowledge .we learn the ideas and concepts from school and put it into our daily life .that is the purpose of why we go to school .however , if we go to school and just learn all the facts for just pass the exams , then we completly missunderstand the purpose of eduaction .
