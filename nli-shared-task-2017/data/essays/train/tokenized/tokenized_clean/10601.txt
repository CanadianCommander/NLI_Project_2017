i can see both advantages and disadvantages to try new things and take risk for being successful .you can whether choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risk for being successful .i definetely believe that people should try new things and take risk for being succesful .if you do everything with a routine that means you know the results .for example if a farmer use traditional ways for agriculture , he can guess how much crops he will get .he can avoid risks by doing that .but it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he wo nt be successful .he will get as same amount crop as next year .the point i am trying to make is , that is not a vakid way for being a suscussful person .on the other hand he could try different ways in order to get much crop which means taking risk for success .in my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks .for instance , if the farmer try a new agriculturel way which is not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops .he could get whether  less or much  but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk .i already know that lots of successful people in business area tried new things and figure out new ways .that is the main reason of their success .for instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper .he decided take risk , he resinsged and established a local newspaper and then he made it success .and we all know that newspaper owner today .to sum up , i always experienced that successful people take risks .they try new ways instead of only doing what they already know .they take risk for being successful .
