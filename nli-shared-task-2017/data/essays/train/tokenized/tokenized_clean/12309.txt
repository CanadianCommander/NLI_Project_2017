i disagree , i do not think that in twenty years there will de fewer cars in use than there are today .people who think differently probably feel protecting the enviroment merits strict regulation restricting car use .nonetheless , such regulations have proven , in many instances , to accomplish the contrary regulatory goal .for example , in places such as bogota , colombia , longstanding restrictions on car use have helped to improve the traffic situation during rush hours .nevertheless , such restrictions have been ineffective as regards the overall number of cars in use .the restriction implemented in bogota , and other colombian cities , allocates the right to use a vehicle during rush hour on certain days , depending on the last number of the license plate .for example , license plates that end with the number `` 2  may be used on mondays , wednesdays , and fridays , an not on tuesdays and thursdays .such a meassure has greatly increased the demand for automobiles , since peolpe are not willing to use the preecarious transport system in place in the city , and prefer to buy a second car in order to avoid the restriction .considering the exponentiality of birth rates , and the importance of car manufacturers as job generators , i think it is safe to assume that more and more people will become car buyers , and automotive industry employees .i also think that researching better fuel alternatives , and better , enviromental friendly materials and car construction techniques may lessen the impact the industry has on the enviroment .in sum , i do not think the number of cars will decrease in twenty years time for four reasons .first , restrictive regulation is not always the best alternative , and sometimes even makes the situation worse .secondly , there is no reason to beleive that that overall demand will decrease , given the fact that population increases , and ecomonies such as china , which are waking up will surely fuel the market for more than 20 years .thirdly , the industry generates a lot of jobs , it is very important , and lastly new technologies may lesser
