i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , especilly for those young people which are born in the 1980s in china .the logics of consuming has a great difference between the young people and the old people .nowadays , the young people prefers to the brand products a lot .for instance , one of my roommates likes wearing sports shoes , and he spends nearly 3000 rmb to buy the 3 pairs of nike shoes a time .3000rmb means no more than a month s salary for him , but it equals one-year expenses of his old father and mother living in the countryside .the young people like traveling far away during their spare time or public holidays , but the old people usually do not go out of city for saving the costs .my colleague has been to yunan province with his new girl friend during this year s national holidays , they have been to there for 7 days , cost them about 6000rmb .he also suggest his father and mother go with them .but when these two old people considering the big expense , they tell their son that they only want to climb the mountain nearby .the young people usually pan the career by attending a lot of differenting trainings , the spend their money for the excuese of better careers in the future .the old people often save their small money and accumulate by depositing in to the bank , they want to leave this money to their following generations .
