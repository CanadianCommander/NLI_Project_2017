teaching is a major activity in ones life .people improve theirselves by learning from the schools , experiences and the like .the more they learn , the better they lead their lives .however , there are many disagreements about how to teach students .besides how is taught is so important , what is taught is also vital .learning can change the life and improves the communication of ones to the others and the environment .the importance of understanding the ideas and concepts is much more required according to learning the facts for students .firstly , it can be considered that there is not only a true for any circumstances .there are facts and people decide which fact is their fact .it will be unlogical to expect people doing all the same things .hence , the best way is to teach the ideas and concepts of the other peoples .this will help them to find out their own paths .demonstrating people the cases which others are passed by and showing the behaviours makes much more sense .furthermore , if ideas and concepts are taught instead of facts , the improvement in cultures begin .learning the way of reactions to the different circumstances by different people make ones go one step further .according to a survey lead in an european university , people are selected from different cultures are put into two different classes a and b. the people in the a class are given a piece of paper writing that the boiling point of water is 100 celcius .besides the other group is making an experiment showing that water boils at 100 celcius and the idea beneath it .after a while , they are asked to examined and the results show that b class members are much more successfull according to the other group .this shows the importance of ideas than the facts .in the light of these , it can be cited that ideas and concepts are worth to be learned to improve the community .also they help to find people their ways .
