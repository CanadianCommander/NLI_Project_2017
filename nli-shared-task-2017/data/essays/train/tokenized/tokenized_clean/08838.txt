the purpose of advertising a product is to make it known to the public , to claim its benefits and to induce potential customers to buy the product .advertisements come in different forms and through different media : tv , radio , internet , posters on streets , displays in stores and hand-outs in public spaces .furthermore , advertisments can be targeted to a specific group of people ( women , children , elderly ) or can interest the entire population .whatever the means of the advertisement , an ad wants to convey a certain image and to convince people through wise usage of colors , words , shapes , sizes and people used in the ad .with my definition of advertisment , i agree with the statement saying that `` most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are  .advertisements usually only display the advantages and upsides of a product or service , and do not show its flaws .even if the product or service does not have any faults , it will mos probably be shown in its best or even enhancing light in the ad .an example that i often encounter is advertisements for low cost flights .web-sites and and airlines companies often advertise very low flight ticket prices .however , the price is never what it is claimed to be .the prices advertised always omit fuel and tax surcharges , are restricted to specific dates - on which most people do not wish to fly , and often do not allow passengers to travel with luggage without extra costs .so even though low cost tickets may seem attractive , they often end up costing the same amount of money as other tickets once everything is paid for .another good example constitutes fad diets .fad diets are popular diets , followed by many men and women in the us , and are usually advertised through books , tv ads and internet pop-ups .fad diets show healthy and smiling people eating whatever the diet prescribes and losing weight over short periods of time .the ads however do not describe how difficult it actually is to follow that diet , how painful it may be and how easy it is to re-gain the weight just lost .they do not either display how expensive the diet is and often do not warn od secondary effects , such as depression , self-image troubles and eating disorders .consequentially , i concur that advertisements are misleading and do not convey the real value of the product or service advertised .even though there is an increasing number of regulations to stop advertisers from lying in ads , customers keep on being lurred by the shining image that ads give of certain products .
