i agree people should take the risks in new things .it is the path to the great achievement .a new busness requires a new and unique idea .the reason is people already make the benefits from the ideas that have been used .if the new businessman does not come with a new idea , the customers and bank would not be interested in that .therefore , i agree a new businessman should take the risks in new things rather than doing what people already know .in 1970s , steve jobs starts his own computer business .in that time , no one believe computers would enter everyone s life and become part of it .steve trusts his prediction to the furture and spend his entire energy to improve computer .he does not use dos systerm ( use word to control ) that people generally use in that time and create a new systerm that uses picture to control computer instead using dos .this innovation makes him successful and let computer becomes easier that general people to use .right now , steve is the chairman of apple company which is one of the larest computer company in the world .steve s successful story becomes the modern new entrepreneurers  goal .follwing the past ideas to start a new business has only a few chance to survive .surveying all of the past business story can give lots evidences to support it .therefore , taking risks in new things has lots chance rather than doing what was doing in the past .
