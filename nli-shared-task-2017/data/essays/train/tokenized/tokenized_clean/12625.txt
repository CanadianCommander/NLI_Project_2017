the problem of helping his community is very difficult to deal with due to his complexity .many people belive that teenagers do not give enough time to help their community because they do not care about it .on the contrary , the statement that people gives time to charity can also be partly justified because nowadays people try to be closer with the poor people .however , all aspects into account , i stronghly feel that young people do not give enough time to their communities .first , i agree with the statement that explain that young people are more interessted in video games or getting out than in helping people .for instance , when we need to go the see my grandparents , my little sister always tries to find a solution to do something else this day ( chatting on internet , meeting some friends , ... ) .another exemple to illustrate that young people do not care about elders is the bus .i can barely understand what cost to young people to ask a old man or woman if he or she wants the sit .besides it better to stay on your feet after a whole days of lessons where you have been sitting for hours .but it is true that is difficult to really help his community , it take a lot of time and nowadays it is hard to find some free time .however their is some people who like to help people of their community , they do a very nice job like .to illustrate my point , i would like to talk about people who give some warn food for people who do not have enough money to eat something hot during the winter time .therefore not everybody do not care about his community , but a lot of people think that other people do that for them .i am not particularly active to help my community , but for me it is a lack of time .but this year i have decided to help some young people to their homework in order to give them the pleasure of working .to sum up we could say that not everybody do something for his community but i am not sure that 50 years ago it would have been better .i have the feeling that people help more and more their community with money for associations .their is an age for everything and , perhaps , the youth who do not care about community will change their mind and become an activ helper .the community needs help whenever and whoever gives this help .
