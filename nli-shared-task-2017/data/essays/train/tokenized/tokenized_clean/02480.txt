although some may assert that knowing the facts is the most important thing when studying , i believe that it is much beneficial for students to actually understand the ideas and concepts for their better studies .to begin , it would be much time-saving for children to grasp the concept before studying the facts of the subject .if they memorize the facts initially and then try to understand the ideas , it would take them more time to obtain all the knowledge in that area .since people usually forget the facts they memorized , after going through the concepts of the study they are working on .for instance , if i memorize the terms used in water circulation and then try to understand the concept of it , i would have to go over the words again , since i have to fit my knowledge into what i have learned right now .while understanding the ideas in the first place can make me only fit the terms in to what i have already done understanding .on top of that , it would make the study much easier to know the concepts first .when one understand the thins and then learn the facts related in it , it comes to person s mind in more influential way .the study of math can be a good example .if a child in a kindergarten learns that ` 1 plus 1 is 2  , they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2  but do not actually understand the term of plus .while , if they initially learn what plus actually means , then they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2  and ` 3 plus 2 is 5  and so on .by understading the idea of something , it leads people to learn in more efficient way .by grasping the concept of the subject , one can save their time and effort .all in all , i believe that learning ideas and concepts of something in the first place is much benefitable and profitable for the people to actully learn and study a subject .
