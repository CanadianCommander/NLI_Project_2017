recently , it seems that youong people do not give enough time to helping their communities .unfortunatelly , i can not help agree it .including me , most of young people do not feel storong relationship with their communities .in my experience , there are two reasons which make me think that way .first , an athletic festival is hold in the comunity where i live annually , i think taking part in something community event means helping it .i have taken part in it just once .but in fact , i could not find any young people there .i reckon the reason why young people do not join that festival is that young people prefer to spend a time with their friend than family or their communities .i also guess that some young people think to contribute or help their communities is kind of waste of time .second , especially reacently , young such as university students tend to live themselves .actually , most of my friends live apart from their family .it means that it is no longer possible to help thier communities .in fact they can help the communities where they live now .but they might feel like to do it because it not their home town .so may feel that they are stranger there more or less .as far as i know , it is clear that young people do not help their communities much .including me , the value of connection with their communities getting less stronger among young generation .i think this problem shoud be considered more seriously .otherwise , the communities which is active with young people
