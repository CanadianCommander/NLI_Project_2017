community is a group of people that have the same objective or goal .any community can have almost people of every age group and especially and mostly the youth .with the given statement , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  , i ll not accord as per my view .let us have a brief situation analysis along with some examples to support my view .energy is what that drives the youth at their age .so , any community will have the most contribution from the age group of the youth only .interest and enthusiasm are two other key words which are particularly special about the youth and indicate their attendance to the communities .well , there might be a category which doesnt have these qualities and doesnot care about the time to help their communities .we can actually call them lazy , in other words the youth lacking the energy and fire to rise the spirits and take up the work .but because of this , we can not say on the overall that youth do not give enough time to helping their communities .because we can mainly observe that all the communities are still running and for that they needed to be given time .if its not one part of tghe youth that doesnot contribute , then its the other part of it which does that .but basically the communities are being helped upon by the youth .for example , in today s busy life , a person if not going to church on sunday can not be called not giving eough time to help his community .because the same person might donate a lumpsome amount to the church on an occasion tries to show his responsibility of helping it .not enough time is nt the correct word for todays life as its very busy .all it does matter is whether the individual helps the community or not and most of the time youth does help but probably in a hidden or indirect way .its wrong to say that they are nt giving time , because there is no time itself due to their busy schedule for them .hence i ll disagree with the given statement and go with the one as `` young people nowadays might not have enough time but certainly trying to help their communities .
