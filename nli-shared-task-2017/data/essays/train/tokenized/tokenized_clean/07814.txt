these days , we can see so many advertisement on tv , or in newspaper .these are all very attractive , so i think advertisement is really important thing for companies to sell products well .however , i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are several reasons .first of all , i have a friend working in a section of advertisement of a company , and i heard from him about it .accoroding his talk , in fact , most of all campanies trying to make products seem much better than they really are in order to get consumer s attention and make products popular .in addition he said that they can not win the competition with other companies if there is no advertisement like that , and this situation is same as these other companies , so it is neccesarily for selling products .moreover , i have experienced some of it .when i was in highschool , i was on baseball club of highschool .second summer in that club , my baseball shoes was broken , so i bought a new shoes on-line .when i first saw that shoes on-line , it seems to have really good shape and beautiful sole .however , when i got the shoes , i was so disappointed to it .it was so different of the picture i saw on-line .as you can see , there are some opinion about it , in fact wa are attracted by that advertisement .
