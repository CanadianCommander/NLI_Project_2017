although i can imagine reasons why people would consider learning of facts as the most important task of students , because in some situation a specific knowledge is a great advantage and all that counts , i totaly agree with the statement named above .i do share the opinion that the understanding of general ideas and concepts is more important for several reasons .first , this ability is transferable to many situations and subjects .for example even if a person changes her major subject of studies , it is still possible to use the accomplished knowlege of methods and concepts in the new subject .on the contrary , the simple facts of the previous studies are most of the time no longer usefull .second , human brains are only able to provide a limited number of facts at the same time , so people will not remember details of facts after a few months or years and need to relearn them anyway .according to my opinion , another reason to judge the learning of facts less important is the current way of living .because of the fast technological development in our century , a reasonable amount of facts which you learn today might be toal useless very quickly .for example some programming languages which were commonly used only a few years ago are now not up to date any longer .this technological environment also enables people to get to know specific facts very fast by starting research in the internet , which makes the knowldege of facts even less important .but it is necessary to be able to distinguish the quality of web pages , which leads again to the argument that a general knowledge is important .because of those reasons stated above , i came to the conclusion , that the knowledge of facts is time limited and being capable of using general concepts and ideas will last longer and are therefore more efficient than facts .
