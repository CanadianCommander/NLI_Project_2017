i am not quite agreed with this statement because we can not be so radical .it seems like all the young people would not help enough their communities .i recognize that some teenagers tend to be lazy and people would like them to provide more efforts but it is unfair to say that everybody acts this way .now if we focuse on the vocabulary used in the statement , one word retains my attention : nowadays .implicitly it would mean that they were helping more their communites in the past .that can be true .if we go back in time , we would realize that our life style was quite different from this we have today .people was more helpfull , they spend more time together .now young people are more independant .i am wondering what communities refers to ; to the family , to school , to friends ?young people use to spend more time with their friends than with their relatives .in that case , i can understand the point of view of the person who wrote the statement .now if we talk on a mondial level , i think that young people are interested in helping communities abroad .i read an article in a magazine whitin they explain that more and more young adults would like to take part in worldwide exchange programs such as humanitary help in south america .they stay in for example peru to give free english lessons to children in primary school who can not afford to have an acade ; ic education because of their poverty .i think that young people give time to helping their communities in some ways that other people , maybe , can not see at first sight .
