in our world are a lot of products and every day more products are created .they are very big differences between them .in my opinion most products could be been better as they are and the advertisments show us .there are a lot of products , which are really good , like different kinds of water .on the other hand , there are a lot of products , which could be been better like jeans .i think that in the past the jeans had a better quality then now .for this there are some reasons .my first reason is that people buy cheaper jeans in lower quality and the big firms like lewis had to get also cheaper prices , but on the other hand i think that the new designs had change the quality .there we can see the problem of the advertisments .they show us , the need of a new style , but they do not speak about lower quality .it decrease of cause of chemicals , which are need for the producing .an example are jeans in white color , because they were produced in blue and then the color is destroid .an other example is perhaps that advertisments always have the best shower gel .i think that it was good for a log time , but every new product is a lot of better then the one before .i can not belive that it is possible to create every few month an other one , which is better than the one before .furthermore they show us thinks , which make the product better , but it was always insite .i think that most products are good , but not so good , as advertisments show us .on the other site it is there job to show us that we have to spend money for new thinks .normally that is a good way , because the firms have to spend money for there research and research is a very fundamental thing in our world .
