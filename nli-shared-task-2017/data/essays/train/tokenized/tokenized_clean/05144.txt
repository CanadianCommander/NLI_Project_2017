it is true that cat is very usable , and so meny people use it for going to works and shopping , many other things .but i disagree to this statement , because of the following two reasons .firstly , cars makes a lot of co2 , and this is being a big problem now .i want to believe that people will try not to use cars too much , and make the co2 level more lower .secondly , internet is getting common very rapidly .in twenty years , maybe all the people in the developed country wii have their own computer , and they could study and do works , everything at home .even shoppin can be done by internet .this means people does not have to go out as much as now .so , the use of car will be less .to place the time used for going to school , works , and shopping , we can go walking and play sports outside .this is much more healthy and comfterble than using car to go everywhere .maybe families and friends can take more good comunication by walking together wathing the views .and more , we does not have to be catche by the traffic problem .i wish these things will really happen and the numbers of car will decrease .ofcourse the co2 problem is too the big reason , but nowadays there are too much sad news caused by cars .i think the decreasing of car uses will also decrease sad news .now many families have more than two cars at home .but we should have the least
