the school education is a very important part of people live .the school education method changes among different cultures and it can influence the future life of persons .it is not very easy to answer this question because either undestanding ideas and concepts or learning facts have pros and cons .when a student is very young , it is very difficult to him to understand ideas and concepts .for instance when i was in elementary class i rebember that the majority of lessons were explanations of facts .i think it was a correct education method because i was not able to understand ideas and concepts .before beginning to understand ideas and concepts it is important to learn facts !on the other hand a student in secondary class needs to be stimulated with lessons concentrated on ideas or concepts .if a student of a secondary class follows only lessons full of fact , he can be very leasy and he can lose the interest in studies !nevertheless there are particular topics in wich the students must learn a lot of facts to try to understand .for instance history is full of facts and is full of ideas and concepts too .but a student can not understand historical ideas and concepts if he does not know before the crononogical sequence of facts !in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .i thing that both understanding ideas and concepts and learning fact are important parts of the student education .in particular learning facts is the basic support for consequent understanding idesa and concepts .
