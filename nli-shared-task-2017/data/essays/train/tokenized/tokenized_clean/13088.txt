nowadays many people travel in groups , led by a tour guide .i think this is not the best way to travel , and i try to avoid these organised holidays .since i ve been young , i have travelled very much with my family , and we have never been in a group .this has made ties between us stronger , and it gives us the oportunity to spend time together , which is usually hard during school time .if we had traveled with a group , we might not have had so much good time together .one that bothers me about traveling in a group is that you are always with strangers that , even if they can be very nice people , are not close to you .moreover there can be people in the group who try to impose themselves as the `` leaders  , organizing everything .you then loose part of your autonomy and end up angry at them , and at yourself , for having accepted to travel with other people .moreover , my family holidays have always been organized by my mother , so we could choose what we wanted to see and how much time we thought we should spend in each place .the memories we have of our trips are therefore very personal and , in my opinion , more satisfying than those of people who have to follow a tour guide because ours are unique .moreover , each time i see a travel group i get the impression that their trip is a mear product , that is sold to them and that has no personal content .if they compare their holidays to those of other people in travel groups they will realise that they visited the same monuments and heard the same explanations from the tour guide .we can also add that these organized trips leave no space for adventure .for instance , one of my friends traveled to cambodia with her family and had a serie of accidents due to bad weather .even if at first they were nervous because their trip had to be changed , they ended up having a lot of fun , doing things such as riding motor cycles on secondary roads , that they had not planned the least bit !if this happens to a group , the agency in charge can not let them take these `` risks  .
