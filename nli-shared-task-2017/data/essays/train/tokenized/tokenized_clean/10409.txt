travelling , visiting different countries and meeting various kinds of people is my hobby since my childhood .since both of my parents are journalist , i have an opportunity to travel a lot .depending my huge experiences in travelling ( you can call me expert ) , i strongly believe that the best and the funniest way to travel in a small group , preferably close friends who knows each other very well , led by consensus of that group .this short essay will explain why i prefer travelling in a small group is nt led by tour guide and disagree with the given statement in the question .first of all , travelling times are supposed to be the most enjoyable times of the people since they are away from their jobs , responsibilities .in these kinds of times , people should spend their times with the friends because in the routine of the life , we share limited times with them .secondly , buying informative books about the geography , history of the places that we travel is much more accurate information for me than trusting on the knowledge of a tour guide that we do nt know whether or not s/he is expert on the region .thirdly , travelling in a group that does nt know each other very well may cause irritating problems .for example , last summer i joined a tour to turkey , led by a tour guide ( unfortunately ! )and we waited for exactly three hours for a person who was shoppin , ignoring the people who were waiting for her .we lost very valuable hours by only sitting in the bus because our tour guide told us so !!fourthly , chatting with the people that you are nt gonna see them in the future and wasting your time by listening their childhood or their relationships with their husband/wife is another thing that affect my opion about travelling in a group led by a tour guide .in my style of travelling , you can chat with your friends and also listen them because you are caring for them .they are your friends , not the aliens that you have to spend days with .last but not least , deciding together with a consensus about what doing next is much more better than taking directives from a tour guide .it is your holiday and somebody tries to decide your schedule .in my view , it is unacceptable .i believe in democracy and freedom of individual and even by a tour guide , i do nt want to be governed .to sum it up , i definetly prefer travelling with a group of my friends and we do nt need any tour guide because our hearts and minds are our guides .
