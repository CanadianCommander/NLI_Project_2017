although i understand people who say it is better to specialize in one specific subject i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .there are three reasons why i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .firstly if you have broad knowledge you can talk to much more people or students about academic topics .for example i am studying three subjects .this is a reason why i can talk with many different people about many academic subjects .that is why i met and got to know students from different subjects .we often spend time together while we are talking abuot our or one of our subjects .i enyoy this time .secondly i think it is better for your future when you have broad knowledge of many subjects .it shows that you are interested in many things or subjects .for example when you want to get a job it showes better when you can say i am interested in different subjects and when you have different knowledge than having very deep knowledge in only one thing .another thing is when you are working in a company and someone has problems with something you can help or give solutions about that topic .and that is why a lot of people habe a lot of success in their job or in their life .thirdly if you have children i think the children have more respect when you can say i am familiar with different subjects than with one deeply .the children can learn more from you when you have different knowledge .i think it is very important for children when the parents have more knowledge than one deep knowledge .to sum up for me there are only important aspects to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i would do the same way again because it is more important to have different knowledges of many academic subjects than to one deep .for example in a job or to talk with different peole or for your children .
