i agree with the statement .most of today s youth does not care about the things that are happening around them .there are lot reasons as to why young people do not spend enough time helping their communities .one of the most common reply one might get when asked about the reason for not helping their community is `` i do nt have time for that  .in most of the cases , the actual reason is that they do nt want to .for example , when i was the nss ( national service scheme ) co-ordinator 2 years ago , we ( the co-ordinators ) decided to promote the local jute industry by selling jute bags in our cultural festival `` saarang  .but unfortuantely the so called volunteers were reluctant to sell them and the reason they gave is that they ca nt waste time by selling bags that no one purchases .another popular reply to the questions is `` what do i get out of it ?.these days young are brought up in a competitve world and every one thinks about oneself .`` if community service does nt benefit me , why should i care ?  is the kind of attitute developed by today s youth .for example , the govenment of india recently passed a bill on including resevation of seats in national level institutes to obc s ( other backward classes ) .but from statistics their number is very minute compared to the number of general catagory students .so some of us decided to write a petition to the president of india to reconsider the bill .so we went on collecting signatures for the petition .some of the students reply was `` i am already selected and i am going to pass this year .whhs
