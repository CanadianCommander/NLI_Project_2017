the way for many students to reach good results is to learn facts and reproduce them when they are asked to .in general , i never was a friend of just learning facts without understanding the background .but i must agree , that it depends on the topic , which is the best way to learn .when learning a language for example , you have to learn the vocabulary .or when studying medecine , you ca nt get along without just learning the whole anatomy .the same case is when learning about history , there are some facts that you just have to keep in your mind .but : it s only the preparation to be able to work .you will work with the anatomy or the historical facts , that you learned .i think , it is much more important to understand the idea of an concept .that is the only way , to be critical with ideas , to think about it and maybe even to innovate or improve it .at the week-end , i m an instructor of first aid at the german red cross .i never say to the participants of my courses : that is the perfect way to handle a medical problem .as an example , i would like to tell about the `` stabile seitenlage  , which probably can be explained as laying a consciousless person in a stable way on the side .very important to me is to make the people understand , what are the dangers of loosing their mind .and to solve these problems , we think about possibilities against these dangers .finally , the technic called `` stabile seitenlage  is a proposition of me , how the dangers of beeing `` bewusstlos / consciousless ?  can be handled .but if a person has understand why `` bewusstlosigkeit  is dangerous and what can be done against it , he is always able to find a solution even when he ca nt remember the technic of the `` stabile seitenlage  .for an ingenieur , who wants to ameliorate for example a car , it is not enough to know about the facts of the car . ..60 hp , maybe 1.100kg and so on .he must have understood the idea of the concept , how the car works , to be able to change anything .in summary , i think you always have to learn some facts and keep them in your mind first , but when you want to reach at a higher level , you absolutely must see `` behind  the facts , you have to understand the concepts and ideas .and often , you have to understand the concept only once , and you can solve any problem by logical thinking .you can learn all the results of mathemathical terms by heart , or understand one time , how the calculator functions : - )
