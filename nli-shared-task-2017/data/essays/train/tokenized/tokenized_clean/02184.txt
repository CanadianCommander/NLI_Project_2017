it would be universally acknowledged that young people enjoy life more than older people do .according to me , this statement can not be entirely true .let us consider my personal view and the comparison between a young people life and an older person life .for the great majority of people , youngness brings all that a person want : health , beauty , love and so on .and it is wright .but something everybody ignores , is the notion of time .in our society who has time to do what they want ?currently , young people are the most of the time students .they have a lot of work to pass their exams and have their dilpoma .by this way , they study a lot and spend their time working at home or on campus .added to this question of time , a student has no money .studies are very expensives , above all in the united-states .a master could cost 20 000 euros for a year .it would be difficult to have extraordinary week-ends or travel to a foreign country or to do a very expensive sport .all these things bring us to consider diferently a young people life .with no time and no money , how could a student really enjoy is life ?on the other hand , older people do not have all the daily life problems  .of course , they have some healthy problems but they have time because they are retired .they worked all their life , they accumulated money .they can travel all over the world and make their dream possible .they do nt have children at home , they do nt have a lot of preocupation .they can live their life as they want , see their friends when they want .according to me , older people could enjoy life a lot .this brief presentation can lead us to reconsiderate the statement .young people are to busy to lead their life as they want .old people have this opportunity .it is important to realize this .it is my personal opinion .
