many people argue that it is best to do what they already know how to do well , and not take risks .personally , i strongly believe that successful people are those who constantly try new things and reach for the unknown .in fact , as my middle school french teacher once told me , `` you learn from your mistakes  .i agree with her .from my experience , i can tell that mistakes often help you to improve , because you remember them afterward .therefore , you know what you should nt do next time .if you never try new things , though , how can you `` learn from your mistakes  ?you do nt improve , because `` improving  implies that you are dealing with something new , and want to get better .also , i think that ambition is very important .it makes learning exciting , and often contribute to your success .if you keep doing the things you already know , it can get very boring !for example , back in france , i played the piano .after seven years , when felt like i had reached a really good level and did nt need a teacher anymore , i decided to play the cello as well .i do not regret my decision .to be able to play several instruments was very interesting and exciting !finally , i believe that taking risks is important because when you succeed , it gives you a lot of satisfaction and pride .in fact , because you reached a new goal , you feel like a whole new person .for example , i will always remember when my father told me that we would soon be moving from france to the united states .at first , to be honest , i was very sad .i did nt want to leave my friends and i was afraid of the unknown .a few months after we had moved , i felt very different .this experience has been great .now i know how to speak english , i made new friends . ..i even plan to attend college here in the u.s .if my family had refused to emigrate because it meant taking risks , we would have missed the best experience of our lives .in conclusion , i agree with those who say that `` successful people try new things and take risks  .of course , when `` taking risks  is too dangerous , i would not agree but in general , ambition is great .
