* in my opinion it is better to specialize on one subject rather than many academic subjects but at the same time we should have a little basic knowledge about the other subjects too .it is always better to have an indepth knowledge about one particular subject and be an expert in it or else the person will obiviously be `` jack of all and master of none  .having indepth knowledge in a particular subject will obviously make a person skilled in that field and he / she can concentrate and contribute the best towards that particular subject .i agree that the world today is rapidly progressing in every field .i however totally donot deny that we should not have any knowledge about any other subject rather the the one in which we are specializing because the world is growing too fast and if we are not aware of the developments taking place then we will obviously be like a frog in a well .a person has to be dynamic enough and should be aware of all the fields and shouldnt be an alien to a new subject .a dynamic person in my opinion is a person who should be able to talk about the computers at the same time should also know what the green house effect is .given a little math we should be able to that as well because these are the basics which every person has to know .we humans are social beings and when move around in society we meet people from different fields .when we converse with each other we should be able to converse on any subject though we may not essentially be an expert in it .i would like to conclude saying a person should have a sound knowlegde of every subject but at the same time he should also be an expert in one subject atleast .
