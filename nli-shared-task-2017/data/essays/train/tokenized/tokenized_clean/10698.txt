it is debatable whether young people these days do not give enough time to helping their communities .some people think that young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their communities because they are usually considered to be selfish and not caring .however , i disagree with the idea that young people in the recent time do not sacrifice enough time for their communities .first of all , young people these days are not actually as selfish as they are thought to be .they do care about their communities and know exactly what they can do for them .for example , as one person of young people nowadays i have been participated to the charity .from the experience , i was amased that lot of young people actully sacrfice their lot of time for communities .they had been working for the poor and any people who need help at least once a week .secondly , we can see many articles and issues around us everyday lives about the young people giving their time to helping their communities .according to the research on the korean chosun newpaper , it is more young people than others who sacrifice themselves in sudden accidental situations by 30 % .in summary , young people nowadays are willing to help their communities in diverse ways .they sometimes take long and regular time to help others , and sometimes give great sensibility to save people in danger .as there is also a saying that `` sound body , sound mind ,  it is natural for young people with sound body to have sound mind somehow more than other people .
