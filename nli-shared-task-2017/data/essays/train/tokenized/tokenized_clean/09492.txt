i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i have couple of experiences and reasons to support my opinion .first , it is always more fun for me to travel with a group of people .since i consider myself a social person , it gives me a great opportunity to make new friends .for example , i had such a great time in my last trip to italy .we visited the historical places during the day time and enjoyed the delicious italian pasta with a glass of wine and laughter at night .it was incredible .furthermore , a tour guide is very very important for a travel .i believe that it helps a lot to visit the new places with a person who already knows about their histories .it is harder for me to read it from a book .also , i have a short term memory on those kind of things .the first time when i went to barcelona by myself , i had already forgot the story of the famous sculptures , so it did nt make any sense to see them without the particular information .finally , i think it is much better to walk around with a group of people .it attracts the local store owners .they tend to be more kind because they realize that it is a group of tourist who know nothing about this place .also , a tour guide helps us to get discounts for the souveniers from the stores he knows .in conclusion , .although i preferred to travel alone at the begginnig , i realized that it is more fun when i travel with friends or my future friends to be .that s why , i believe that it is much better to travel with a group of people and a tour guide
