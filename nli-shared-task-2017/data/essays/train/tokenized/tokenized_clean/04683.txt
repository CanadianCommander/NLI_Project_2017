i agree this statement .in moderm time , advertisements for products is a very important marketing statege .the industries want have a good sale on their products , then they need to make attracive advertiseings to consumer .therefore , most of them were made over to show its product quality that they really have .i make some examples to support my opinion .first , they are over imagination on advertisements .like some liquard products advertisements , we can see offen on the tv .in a pretty hot day , you get a cool drink and drink it , and then you will feel the weather becomeing cold and forget the deady hot weather .i think this will not really happen when anyone drink the prioduct .they will never say what is not good for human , like soda , if you drink it everyday instead of water , you will gain weight a lot and also will cause some disease for body .second , it is not ture for the products on advertisements , i remember i have seen a comercial is about battery .they put their product into a robert and compare another unknowen company s product which put into a same robert too , and then they test which battery can keep more time to let the robert move .after this , i have bought the company s products and used , but i did nt recoginze what is really big different with other brands .not all the advertisements tell the real turth that their product is .next , they make everyone seems want to purchase their products .like some advertisements show people want to take the last staff make a long line or even fight to each other for this staff .it make consumer confuse that this product is every important for them , so we have hurry to buy it early or you ca nt buy it anymore .there is overshow why this product we really need it .we need more information to support this product is we real want or not .
