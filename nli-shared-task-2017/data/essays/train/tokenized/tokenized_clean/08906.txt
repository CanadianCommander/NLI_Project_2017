the student preffer to understant the ideas and concepts instead the facts , i support that statement .nevertheles they need the facts sometimes to comprehend the ideas .i mean that facts are important too in time to learn the lessons .i am an university student since 6 years , so i learn how to learn above the time .at the beginning it is very difficult to study , because when we do not know what are the importants things in a lesson , we spend too much time reading and reading , what is more we do not do it objectively .then the students carry confidence and trust in their potencial .i mean , when they pass many time trying to understand something that is on the paper and can not realize of it , then note that it was easier if they learn the concept .facts helps the students to support an idea .for example , when i read about some physical theory and it is too much difficult to comprehend , i always look for an example or a fact that helps me to remember the concept and to open my mind and try to see it in another way .studing objectively and making your own resume of the concepts , that means that you write on your book the main ideas , gives you the opportunity to watch them carefully and helps you to succes in the subject .resolve a problem will not be a problem because you understand the concept and then you can use it in all the
