i would not personally agree with the statement .life to me is a flowing river that is beautiful at every stage .what ultimately matters is our perspective towards life , our priorities and values we hold most close to ourselves .ultimately i guess it all boils down to what we concieve or understand of the notion of ` enjoyment  .for a child playing could be enjoyment .something as small as building sand castles could !as the child grows his demands and needs evolve with him and ultimately what he asks from life would determine his levels of happiness or enjoyment .at adolesence the sparks of chemistry between the oppsite sexes could be exciting .later on , finding someone you love or someone who loves you maybe of most importance at a given phase of live .at a latter stage one might want to marry and settle down or may choose not to do so as per ones our personal choice and whatever gives them satisfaction .even the birth of a child and every moment of bringing up that child could be a great deal of enjoyment !!as you age your grandchildren could be the greatest source of enjoyment .my belief in this theory has only been augmented from empirical evidence i bring right from home .my parents are old yet happy and content .they enjoy every moment and live every second of it to the fullest .in brief i could summarise this theory in terms of a utilitarian .life is extremely short so make use of it to the fullest - use it up to the optimum for as long as you live , your living your life no matter how old or how young you are .therefore enjoyment to me is a subjective term the interpretation of which shall differ from person to person and is not determined by the age .
