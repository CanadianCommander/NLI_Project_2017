i completly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .understanding is not only memorizing a fact it is also about interpretating and thinking on what you have learned .understanding allows the students to develop creatity that will lead them the solutions to problems they will face in the future .the fact that a student understands a concept or an idea will help him develop the ability to inovate .understanding gives anyone the ability to come up with a new and personal solutions to a problem or situation .learning and memorizing is the old way of teaching .this method does not help the students develop abilities they have and that they are going to need in the future .learning or memorizing a fact will not allow the students to think or be creative .it only helps them adquire new or additional information on a certain topic that they will not be able to use on a different and more adverse scenario .today having the ability to understand and interpretate a concept or an idea has led to the improvement of processes and techniques used in many industries .this improvements can be translated into time and price reduction .if students do not have the ability to understand they will not create and inovate and their possibilities of success will be narrowed .they will be in a very difficult situation to compete versus those who do have the ability to understand .i definitely agree that it is much more important for students to understand ideas or concepts than it is for them to lean facts .understanding will led students to have a easier educational career and a more succesfull professional trayectory .
