education is different in every country .so ; e countries prefer to specialize their children in one specific subject , whereas some others countries prefers to give many differents academic subjects to their pupils .my thought is that having a knowledge of many academics subjects is better than beeing specialized in one subject , and this for many differents reasons .first of all , in our daily life , we all need differents knowledges .as an exemple , we can take a typical day of someone living in a rich country .let s say this person has to do his grossery shopping .he will need some knowledge in mathematics for that .if he wants to save some money , he will need to calcul in his head which product is less expensive than the others .if he has a budget , he will have to calcul how much he is spending so when he will have to pay , he won4t be surprised .moreover , we need to know things on many subjects if we want to have a social life .i think that when we are with friends , many subjects are discussed , and if we do not want to be seen as a stupid man , we need to know things in many differents subjects .if the school teach us only one or two subject , we will have to be with people coming from our social class , because they will have the same culture as we do , so we wo nt feel stupid or rejected .this would be a break to the social ladder .finally , if we think in a practic way , having a knowledge on differents subjects will allow us to help our children when they will be at school .i think that everybody , when he was a child , has been helped by his parents , or by someone in his family .it helps keeping the generation in touch and it also helps the mental development of the child .as a conclusion , we could use a sentence of a famous philosopher who said that a perfect man is someone who has a good spirit in a good body .it means that if we want to be in a good health , we have to practice some sports , of course , but we also have to know many things on differents subjects .those are the some reasons why i think it is quite better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .but we can wonder what do the politics think of that nowadays if we look what they are doing in france , where they want to specialize the children when they are 14 . ..
