nowadays , young people have very busy lifes and it can be thought that they do not spend enough time helping their communities .in fact i disagree with that point of view and i think young people do a lot for humanity in the daylife of their communities .first of all , young people are very implicated in education of younger .i have a lot of friends who give mathematic supports lessons to children after class or who help younger students to prepare for their exams .in my view , helping in education is very important and this kind of help is very valuable for the society .secondly i have noticed on several occasions that young people are very helpfull to elderly people .some students help elderly to do shopping ; others go for a walk with disabled people .these examples shows that young people are very implicated and feel concerned about the elderly in their communities .finally younger citizens are usually the most implicated in humanitary projects in their cities .many organisations helping disabled people like patients who suffer from toxicomania or unemployed people were raised by young leaders who were very involved in finding fundings to realize their projects .moreover when there is a natural disaster in a town , we usually see that the younger are the first on the field .in conclusion , i trully think that young people are very concerned by the condition of living in their communities .despite their lack of time and money , they are really motivated to help people in needs and are often more implicated in helping their communities than the elderly .their differents actions are very encouraging for the future of our communities .
