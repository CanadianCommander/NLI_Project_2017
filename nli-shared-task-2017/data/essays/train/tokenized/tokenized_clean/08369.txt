i agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for example , the health care industly , especially those diet products .`` it is so easy , and so quick to lose weight .then why is 50 % of population overweight in this country ?advertising with loud background music , good looking models , and catchy frases .that s all you need to convence people to buy product .unfortunatley , i am one of the people who just overpowered by advertisements on tv .i bouthg a treadmill which i thought it was the greatest product that i can lose weight with less work .now it is in the closet and i will never see it again .when you are wathing these commercials , you feel like you can be what the commercial say you will be .almost entire nation watches tv everyday .advertisements are everywhere not only tv , but also internet , magazines .and these mass media have so much power these days .it is so powerful that overpowering people s ability to think in this materialistic world we live in .if the commercial says so , it is good product .you need to stop to think what is really going on .it is so controled by advertisement industry , people forget that we do have ability to think what best for you .we need to share the information which producuts really work , and which do nt .we have to protect ourselves from overpowered media misleading .
