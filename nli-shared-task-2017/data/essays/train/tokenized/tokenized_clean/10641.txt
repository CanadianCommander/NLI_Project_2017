about fifty years ago , one the greatest president of the united states pointed out the main problem of modern societies .john f. kennedy said , do not ask what the country can do for you , ask what you can do for the country .we live in a society that promotes individualism .individualism can be definied as way of projecting problems only through you own scope and to pay less attention at your environment .i think individualism is more and more developped and people tend to give less time to their community .this subject is the great battle between the ancient and the modern .according to the modern , people are more and more focused on their personal environment , that is to say their family , friends , work environment and themselves .in our modern society , this phenomenon reaches young people even more that parents and grandparents .they used to be raised with a very high sense of values , focused on work and religion .even if each family , according to its history , need , wealth , had its own priorities , these were the main values .and there was a sense of commun work and commun need .young people who live in modern societies tend to be more focused on themselves and to be more selfish .in developped countries , they do not fear hunger , thirst , problems of wealth .i think that most of them are self centered .we must believe that this kind of attitude will change and that young people with give more time to help their communities .on the one hand , there is always the role of religions .they can be used to make people understand the importance of giving , sharing and receiving .on the other hand , we can hope that intellectuals and politicians will raise these question in the future .not only is the idea of helping the community relevant , but it is also more and more important in a time of great incertainty .
