i agree with the statement .i will chose the group travel led by tour guide .first , using a tour guide takes us less time to search the detail of the place we will visit and the way how to go there .if we do nt have enought time to study them , this become a convinient way to travel .secondaly , a tour guide may know the special place which ordinay tourists do nt know .i think it is very difficult to find out the place which local people only knonw good .so if we travel led by a tour guide , we may more appriciate the tour .fainaly , travels led by a tour guide provides us with more safly tours .for example , foreign countries travel is the case .when we go to the countries , if we do nt know what the language spoken or how safe the region is , that may ocuur some dangerous situations .so , if we do nt have a confidence we get along with them , using a tour guide is good selection .
