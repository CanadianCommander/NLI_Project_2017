many advertisements are in the world .there are advertisements which is daily goods .there are advertisements which is shoose , or bat for hobies .but , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .so i agree with this suggestion .many people have a pearsonal computer , and use the inter net .inter net have a lot of advertisements and we can buy goods on the inter net .when i was a high shool student , i was interested in buying on the inter net because i entered a soccer team , i would like to a soccer shoose .so i bought a soccer shose on the inter ner , but this shoose was compleately difference at advertisement .in addition , this shoose s size is short at the advertisement .there are many advertisements about food on the tv .people think that they would be liked to eat this food by the advertisements .i would be also liked to eat by the advertisement .i ofren order pizza , but this pizza often different from advertisements .this size is not large such as picture , and food does not looks fresh .there are many advertisements about clothes on the paper .in japan , most of the advertisements is aobut clothes from big departmemt store .they often discount when closes will not different season .so , people go shopping to buy these clothes .i also go shopping to buy these clothes .but , i will not want to buy most clothes , when i go to the department shop , because many clothes is so defferent from advertisement .therefore , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisement is so different
