in korea , there is a new common thought about korean youg people after the world cup 2002 .most young generation showed positive qualities to keep in order , clean up stadium after play , and have a good manner in encouraging .however , it is a picture of one particular period and i do not think it tells that yougsters nowadays are a lot engaged to their community .in other words , i agree with the statement that youngsters are not giving much time to help the community for two reasons ; they arefirst of all , young people participate in community only when it is an obligation .for instance , my sister jina , a highschool student , is relcutant to participate in community work .however , the scholls regulates that it is mendatory to do a voluntary work for the community for 10 hours per year , she does it helplessly .if it is not for school assignment , she never helps the community .she says it is such a boring thing to talk with the eldery , clean parks , help disabled .second , youngsters are too selfish to think about others .especially thesedays , they concentrates to themselves more and more .for example , the educational circumstance are making children to compete .my nephew alice is always top in her class .to be the most elite student , she goes to seven differnet extracurriculum academy .she says she has to be a number one and to be like that , she has no time to spend on others .in brief , thesedays , the young ages are getting more and more selfish by competative atmosphere and spends only a little time to help the community
