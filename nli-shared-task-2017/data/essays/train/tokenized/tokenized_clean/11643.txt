i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rist rather than only doing things they already know how to do well .but is it only possible to do new things and take risk when you have enough money ?normal things like go to the cinema or make a travel in the own land is to boring for these people .maybe they have also made these things and now they want to see some others .i also think that these people do these crazy things because they are affraid of loosing there money or do not be rich for a long time .so in these short time they want to see as much as they can and take the chance .normally rich people are in a rich society .these people do not want to speak about a film you saw last week in the cinema .they want to hear about your last adventure trip in thailand or something like that .some things you can only make when you have enogh money .and i think that anybody wants to make so special things but have no money for that .so it would be only a dream .but i also think that it is better to have some dreams and go working for it , as you have the money and can not join the special thing .for rich people many things are normal , to normal .they think driving a big car and make an adventure trip every half year is as normal as eating and drinking .when people have to much money , so much money that they do not know what to do with it , they often do not get enough from all and that is why they take risks to be happy .i think people who have to much money should give it to an organizations who give it to poor people for which is it not normal to eat or drink .
