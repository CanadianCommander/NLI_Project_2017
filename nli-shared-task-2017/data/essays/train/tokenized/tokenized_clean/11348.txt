i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .it is the stage i think , is more comfortable to enjoy our living .i feel so because it is practically noticed that young one s have lot of zeal in them which makes them more active .the young people work hard for heir future and at times never let their enjoyment go down .for example consider a student who plans to pass in distinction in the annual examination .for achiving this the student works hard the whole year , apart from this the student doe nt miss any other activities that involve enjoyment .young stage is the only stage where we can do anything as we can , no matter wheather it is right or wrong .it is the period where things which cant be done when we become older can be done without any hesitation .they do what ever they want to do so that they can enjoy up to the maximum .for example they can dance , swim , play with the friends , roam here and there , can eat all the stuff which they want to , go for racing , can go for a challenge , involve themselves in entertaining programs etc .on the other part they can enjoy doing what ever their interest is in .like in research field , software , where they can makeup their mind set accordingly .last but not the least i deal with the facts that everyone knows that the young stage is the most preferable stage where everyone finds it interesting when compared to other stages in our life .lastly i conclude saying that the young people enjoy life more than older do .
