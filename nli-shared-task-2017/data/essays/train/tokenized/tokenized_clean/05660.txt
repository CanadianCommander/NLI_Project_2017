the choice between choosing between `` broad knolwedge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize in some specific subject  --- is case and context specific in my personal view .that is neither i negate nor do i concur with the given statement .if a person/project s aim is to have some pripheral understanding and working knowledge of some broader discipline and make a resonable profit out of it along with some of the prerequisites , it is better one chooses broad knowledge of many disciplines .it works well for a low or average ambitious person/projects where details of the task are unnecessary .i.e prefer `` wide extensive than selective intensive  it works well upto undergraduation ( in case of students ) who eventually become some middle level employers where exposure matters than depth .same is ok for school teachers also ( who teach upto 12 th class where motivating and inspiring students is of paramount importance ) .where as for those tasks which demand a thorough knoledge , clarity of fundamentals so that known knoldege can be succesfully applied to other socially productive purposes , one has to choose specilzing in specifics .as an example if one is interested in a scientific mission to achive something useful/spectacular with far reaching ramifications in general and amelioration of society in particular , one has to specialize where indegenous experts required .if viewed from the perspectives of short term gains , broader knowledge approach yields the desired results .on the other hand if long term fruits are aimed at one should specialize in a variety of streams so that over a long run they become worth the investment of time , energy , and human resources spent .as an example if one takes the research during second world war , it was mostly aimed at immediate returns in terms of defence/military / superiority .and mostly such kind of works were supported largely .ofcourse exceptions are always there .later in the post war era , people have broadened their horizons of researcha nd many sub topics then have now become major disciplines .so before zeroing in on a specific approach , short term plans and long term goals have to defined and based on specifics one has to choose the approach .
