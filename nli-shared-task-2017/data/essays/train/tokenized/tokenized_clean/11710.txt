it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because , they can apply this concepts and ideas to resolve facts that may be presents in the future .also , this way would prevent dissapoinmemt and frustration in the student at the time that prepare them to resolve problems without experience , just knowledge .if a student understand ideas and concepts , he would be able to resolve the facts succesfully ; thus , he has the tools to resolve problems and circustances without experience , just by using the knowlegde that he has learned before , in order to learn facts .if the students learn facts before understand ideas and concepts , he would learn more painfull and they proprably would learn more by mistakes .i really think is better learn by adviced that by expirience .to know the ideas and concepts first would prevent the student to make a lot of mistakes that can cost him pain and dissapoinments feelings , because he would propably choose the correct and convinient solution for the fact that present taking his knowledg .even though , this is not a warranty that the students would choose the correct solution .he may choose the wrong one , but there is more propability that he choose the correct solution .i really belive is more important for students to undertand ideas and concepts , that learn facts .i would be more usefull , painless , motivateness and rewardeness to think in a solution taking the concept thar he has , that learn facts without experience and knowledge about it .
