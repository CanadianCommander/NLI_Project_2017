when determining whether a person is successful or not , we all look at different characteristcs he has or what kind of work he has done .in the same way , some may think that successful person comes from only doing what he already know how to do well .though some may think that taking risks is too dangerous , i believe that many successful people try new things and become succsessful because of it .one of the reasons i believe in such way is because i play sports , and i know that i have to take risks sometimes to be successful .one great example would be tiger woods , one of the best golfers to play the sport .he constantly takes risks in every shots he takes , which is probably why he has been the number one ranked golfer for past several years .another great example would be roger federrer .several years ago , only few knew his name .but now , almost everyone who watches or reads sports related articles know or atleast heard or seen his name , as he the number one ranked player in the world .he too takes risks in his tennis matches , when he can just stay back and take simple shot every time .but , he does not stay back and take simple , easy and safe shots when he plays .he takes risks and gambles in order to trick and confuse his opponents .several years ago , he was criticized for not being aggressive enough with his shots .in another word , he was being too safe , not taking any risks .now he is probably better at it than anybody else , and that may be the reason he is very successful .another reason is because of the wright brothers .if they did not make an airplane , where would we be right now ?if they just accepted the idea that humans can not fly , would we have airplanes right now ?i believe their will to challenge new things , and a tremendous challenge , is incredible , and that is why they are regarded as most influencial people in many articles and books .if they did not challenge our old idea , they would not have been successful , as they probably would have stuck to their old job .whether one succeeds in sports , business , or in some other ways does not matter .what matters is the path one takes , and the mind set of one , and i believe all successful share these characteristics .i also believe that doing what one already knows over and over will not make one successful , as someone may be able to the same thing just as well .to beat that person , one should always challenge oneself and take risks to accomplish something higher .
