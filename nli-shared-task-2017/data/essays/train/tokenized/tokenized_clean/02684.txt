although it might be very difficult to know how people act in future i cast doubt on this statement for many reasons .first of all , if people will drive fewer cars there must occur a big invention of a thing in future that is more usefull and at the same time cheaper than our car .looking at the current technologies i do not think that it is possible to create wonderfull thing within the next twenty years .another important point is that third world countries , like india or pakistan are just at the beginning of using cars .they are many years behind the sophisticated countries like for example germany or the united states .so in these countries the car usage will be emerge in high rates .moreover an invention like that should also be not very harmfull to the environment .otherwise the kyoto protcol which was signed by most of the worlds nations could not be fullfilled .and because of there are no recently environment friendly inventions of power delivery i do not think that it is possible within ten years .of course worlds leading scientists are working on more environment friendly things than petrol , but these progresses are made only for cars and not for other forms of transportation devices .finally one could say that it is impossible to invent a more sophisticated transportation device than cars within the next twenty years .so we have to surch for other possibilities whz the usage of cars could decline .most obviously would be the point , that we simply do not use as many cars as we do know .therefore it must be better for people to not use there cars .but as the human being is said to be lousy , that seems very unreal .
