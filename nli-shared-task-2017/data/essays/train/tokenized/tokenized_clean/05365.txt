in japan , where i live , many people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .however , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .first of all , there is quite little time to take a free time , if traveling in a group with a tour guide .for example , when my wife and i went to haneymoon to hawaii in 2004 , we traveled there in a group with a tour guide for seven days .we went to a lot of interesting places , but we could not stay one place where we wanted to stay longer because of restricted time schedule .if we had been there by ourselves , we would have stayed at our favorite places longer .as the above experience , i definitely think that traveling by ourselves is the best .second , traveling in a group with a tour guide is expensive .for instance , when i travel to kyusyu , which is located in southern part of japan , for three days , i stayed a excellent hotel and rent a four-door car , which made reservations by myself .the total cost of this trip was less than a handred thousand yen .it was a reasonable price .on the other hand , when i traveled to the same place in kyusyu for three days with a tour guide package , the cost of this trip was twice as much as that of traveling by myself .this clearly shows that traveling in a group with a tour guide is not economical .in conclusion , in japan , where i live , most of people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .however , i definitely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
