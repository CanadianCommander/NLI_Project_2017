i deeply agree that undestanding ideas is very much decisive than learning facts .it means that you understand the general concept of a situation instead of a little step in the middle of it .in other words , it is just like , what do you prefer ?to take a great view of the horizon from the peak of a mountain or simply from the ground .first , it is important to teach this kind of statement when we are kids .we are starting to learn and understand .we are facing a new process which has nothing from early periods in life .there is no rock in the way .as soon we understand this pattern of behaviour , we will put that into practice .furthermore , once you are used to apply that teaching , you will see things clearer .for example , you do not need to sit in the middle of the problem in order to solve it .step backwards , get a huge view of the problem from different angles and , now , try to face it .we tend to base on our experience to behave in this way .but , it is much better if we learn it as a child .another important thing associated with learning only facts is that we still have to climb up a whole mountain in order to reach the idea .ideas are high up there and we will not undestand how a clock works or a plain flights if we just merely think about facts .it is up where the whole knowledge is located .again , there is always the highest point in the city .say , a skycraper .go there , climb up from the very beginning , start to see advantages and disadvantages and once you get up there you will solve the whole problem .life will be much easier this way .
