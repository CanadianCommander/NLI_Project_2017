i agree with this statement .of course some people might say that learning facts is more impotant .however , it is clear to me that understanding ideas and concepts outweight than learning facts .first of all , education is for improving capacity of student s thinking .if teachers stick their own idea , then students only can think teacher s way .that prevent increasing student s thinking .and , also as we can see , nowadays many schools have student-centered classes to give student think more .in addition , in our country - south of korea - , most of classes are only for leran facts .teachers do nt ask student s thinking , students only listen and write what teacher says .so that my country s people weak of imagination .but as you know , imagination is the power of future .finally , students can more concentrate on thier studies .thinking something , imagne somethings are very interesting .
