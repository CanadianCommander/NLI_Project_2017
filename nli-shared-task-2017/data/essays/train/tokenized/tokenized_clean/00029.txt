i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because ideas and concepts are the roots of the facts , it is the ideas that make the facts to exist and undestanding ideas will help the students to be productive .first of all , in order to rely on some facts there must be generated some ideas and concepts .that is , all facts depend on some ideas and understanding of these ideas causes the occuring of facts .moreover , to learn the facts we have to understand the thought behind the fact .just learning facts will cause the students not to generate new issues and this will cause the number of researches in the schools to drop and soon there exists a generation that is not producing anything but always living with the one in the hand .in addition , it is only possible to develop facts in the light of ideas and concepts .there are facts that is supposed not to change forever like the facts of physics .there are laws of physics and they are supposed not to change .however , there is one point that these facts and laws replaced the old ones .therefore learning a fact is not big deal but understanding the ideas will develop the socities .as a final point , learning facts will just cause students to memorize the facts .however , if they understand the idea behind the fact , they will undestand the topics better .moreover , there maybe some students that handle these topics think about them and make some suggestions about them that can be fact in the future .in conclusion , encouraging students to understand the ideas will improve the researches and will cause the students to be open minded .besides , the students that are trying to see and understand further will contribute to the development of the society .
