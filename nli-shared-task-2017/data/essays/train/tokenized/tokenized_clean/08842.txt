some people believe that the best way to travel is to go alone as they can spend time as they want .but i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .in this discussion i shall present arguments supporting my opinion .there are so many advantages for a guided tour .first and the most important advantage is , a tour guide knows the place better than us .so he/she can take us directly to the popular places that should be visited in that city .this really saves a lot of time , which is an important thing to be considered in a short vacation and also we will not miss any good places if we have a guide .whereas in the situation where there is no guide , we have to enquire about the places to visit and sometimes we may even get lost in the process of finding the route which results in the wastage of time .second , as the tour guide knows about that place , he will be able to explain the history of that place .for example , he can explain the reason or story behind the construction of a monument or sculpture .sometimes they also know about the native stories that were not written in the books .in a tour with out guide , we will surely miss all this information .finally , travelling in group also helps in many ways like a guided tour .first of all , it is fun to travel with so many people and it gives us a chance to make new friends .also , the other members in the group will help us when we have a sudden emergency like health problem .in contrast , if we travel alone nobody will be there to take care of us in the new place where everybody is unknown for us .to conclude , while there are arguments that can be made on both sides , i personally believe that travel in a group with a guide is better compared to travel alone with out a guide .
