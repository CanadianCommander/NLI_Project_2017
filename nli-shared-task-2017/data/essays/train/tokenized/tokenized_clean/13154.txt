there is a phrase that says : getting old begins when regrets replace dreams .on one hand , it is true that young people are more able to enjoy their life than older ones .when you have almost your entire life before you and you can make a lot of plans for your future .the youngest people do not already have to many reponsabilities like children or work and they have more time to enjoy their own life .for example , i want to go and study in australia for the next semester and i am sure i am going to enjoy me stay and maybe me life there .in our days , there is a lot of ways to entertain .young people can enjoy it because they are still physically able to do so .indeed , young people can do more sports , walk on the mountains , surf , parties etc .that is a way not to find their life too boring .on another hand , i think that being old is a beautiful thing because they can see their childlren growing up , help , advise and support them as much as they can .and they also can enjoy visits from their grandchildren which is certainly a bit magic for anybody .a lot of old people do travel a lot once retired and really like it .it is much easier to make trips , see new people , make even short-term plans for your life .i know a friend of my grandmother who is travelling all the time over the world and i think she enjoys her life a lot in discovering all these countries .i will spend a lot of time to the same .but when people are working during 30 , 40 years or more , they can not travel this much and enjoy the possibility of traveling by plane wherever you want .finally , i think that older people can enjoy their life as much as young people .we all aim to find happyness in our own way and the question is : how to find it ?who with ?there are as many awsers as there are individuals .
