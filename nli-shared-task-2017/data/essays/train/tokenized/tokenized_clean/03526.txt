i do not agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think that older people have as many ways to enjoy life as young people do .even though young people and older people have different ways to have fun , i am positive that everyone in society has many opportunities to enjoy her/his life .first , many young people enjoy playing sports , playing musical instruments , hanging out with friends .for example , i am a high school student , and i feel really happy when i play the piano , when i play tennis with my friends , and also when i go to movies or bowling with my friends .i see other high school students having fun playing soccer , videogames , talking with friends .there are many other way to enjoy their life too .second , i have seen on television many older people playing games , having good times with their grandchildren , reading many books , etc .they can find the ways to see happiness in their lives .my grandmother likes sowing , and she told me when i was little that she liked sowing but also liked people s happy faces when she gave them something she made also i have seen old people playing golf , or meeting with old friends from their high schools or colleges .however , it is true that younger people would have more opportunities to enjoy many things because of youth .older people would have less energy or have lost some ability to do something than younger people do .but even though older people may have less opportunities to enjoy life by playing sports or something that needs much energy , they of course can have something they can do without moving a lot or using much energy .there are also many things younger people can not do because of less experiences .for example , as i mentioned above , meeting up with old friends is a thing only old people can do .again , i think older people have many ways to enjoy life as well as young people do .the ways may be different , but everyone has many opportunities to have fun in lives , because i think that is what most people live for .everyone has something he/she can see happiness in to live long .
