some people says the successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .on the one hand , that is true .on the other hand , successful people are also people who only do what they do the best .my point of view on that point is successful people are people who do both of these things .first , a lot of successful people are people who tried new things and concepts and also took risks .the best illustration i can take on that point is steve job , ceo of apple .his company was specialized in computer science .however , he decided to take the risk of a new market : the mp3 player market .now , he succeedeed in imposing his ipod as the reference in the market .almost everybody knows what is an ipod and wants to have one .the new marketing strategy he used is also an aspect of his success .with a good concept , new ideas , and a great part of risk , people arrived to succeed but unfortunately this is not always the case .second , people also succeed by doing only what they know to do well .some persons are very good in their specializations .they are even so good that they could not be replaced in a company and then access to leader roles .for instance , my father was a business engineer .he was so good in what he did that he was promoted every year until reaching the role of director of the sales .he did not have new concepts and he did not take risks too but he succeeded very well in doing what he knew to the best and i consider him as a sucessful people .third , my point of view on the subject is the following : successful people are often people who try new things and take risks in what they do well .i am convinced that if one is specialized in a domain and try new concepts in that domain he has more chances to success .for example , the person who created ebay is a very relevant illustration .he was a computer science engineer and want to make a website for the exchange of stamps .that website became a true success and nowadays every kind of things are exchanged on ebay .if he had opened a shop , i am not sure he would have obtained so much success in his company .to conclude , i do not totally agree with the statement .some people obtained success in trying new things and taking risks but others also reach success by doing only what they do the best .
