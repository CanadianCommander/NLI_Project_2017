it is true that many people succeed by only doing what they already know how to do well .in fact , the artist or claftmen are successful people .however , i do agree that if people try new things and take risks , they can be more successful in their lives .trying new things creats new inventions and technology and new experience .moreover , new things can solve problems in a society .if people try new things and take risks , they can invent new technology .bill gats is a good example .his invention of microsoft made people s life more convinient and easire .he become a millionare becaue he tried new things and took risks .if people try new things and take risks , they can have more new experience .moreover , the new experience is the key to be successful .for example , one of my friend from taiwan trid to come to canda in order to get phd dgree .this was very new expericne for her and took risks because she had to leave her country and live by herself .however , she become a famous resercher after she graduated from the university .more importantly , whiout trying new things , many difficult problmes in this world wo nt be able to be solved .if people can solve the probelms , they can be very halpful and successful .for instance , the lack of energy is one of the social problems .my boss at universtiy has been studying about a fusion energy .he and his co-wokers try to creat new energy for the future .even though his reserch has not complied , he is one of the famous scientists in the world .in conclustion , many may belive that doing what people already know how to do well becomes more successful .however , if people try new things , they can invent new products which are necesarry for many people .additionally , if poeple challenge new things and take risks , they can develop new experience .this also made people successful .finally , as people try new things , they can solve many problems in the future .
