at a first sight , it can be inferred that young people show no interest in helping their community and that they seem to have become more ego-directed , in order to prevent themselves from the duties that a society is asking them .a likely explanations might be that to help the community is no more seen as convenient as it used to be , as it is not rewarded enough .young people do nt feel this as a duty , and think that the world would probably go on without no help from them .furthermore , young people seem to live for the present moment and not for the future , almost as they feel that the duties toward a society will not effect their own future , or the future of next generations .but is most of the youngers seem to share these opinion , it is absolutely not true for all .some of them , who are likely grown up with strong ideals and a steady sense of tradition , still continue to putting their efforts to helping their community .it might be that people living in small towns are easily influenced and touched by community problems .is not unusual for them to be prepared in helping because of the surroundings where they live in .i would nt say that youngers living in the cities are not able to do that , on he contrary , thanks to devices provided by the city , they can easily help communities if they are interested in .compared to few decades ago , the modern society we are living in has , with no doubt , passed through a huge number of changings .given that , it s hard to say which of them has really brought an improvement or a decrease in the quality of everyday life .what is certainly true is that young people summerize the most important and common features of a society .
