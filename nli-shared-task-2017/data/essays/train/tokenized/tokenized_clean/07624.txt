young people nowadays indeed do not give enough time helping their communities .there are various reasons for this .most young people nowadays are engrossed in making a successful career and settling down during their youth .most youngsters do nt really care what happens around them because they are too self-centered .also , the economic conditions of their life too influence whether young people work for their communities or not .today s world demonstrates the darwinian principle , `` the fittest survive  on a day-to-day basis , though not across species , but within the human species .in the extreme race to achieve high goals that they set for themselves , youngsters hardly give any thought to the community around them .most of their time is dedicated to the achievement of their goals and themselves , and not much is left for community service .the fact that it is rare to find anyone volunteering for community service ( rather than being punished with it ) shows how less youngsters nowadays care for community service .another reason why youngsters nowadays do nt give much time for community service is the profound change in mindset of youngsters .they are more materialistic than ever .few youngsters know the pleasure , satisfaction and elation of dedicating oneself for the service of others , nowadays .more addicted to the material pleasures of the world , they spare no thought of community service .this change in mindset has not been sudden , perhaps .over the years and generations , parents impress the importance of community service less on their children , they themselves being materialistic .thus , gradually , children might have no notion of community service whatsoever .the economic conditions in which the stidents are brought up also influences the perspective they develop about community service .if a student is from a poor family , in which most of his time is consumed in his fight for survival , it is less probable that he might be interested in serving the community .but this argument can be confronted with the fact that he might know the pains of being poor , and hence help the poor in the future .nevertheless , economic conditions do play a role in students perception of community service .thus in essence , pressure from all aspects of life keep today s youth from giving enough time helping their communities .further , other issues like the change in mindset of people of all age groups , selfishness , and economic conditions are a major cause .
