holleywood star tom cruz did nt stop with that he already know how to do well .currently , he is trying to do other thing .not only tom cruz is the one who success and also want to try new things and take risks .a lot of famous people want take risks rather than only doing they already know they can do well .therefore , i agree with successful people try new things and not do the thing that already know how to do well .for one thing , most of the famous people will be in news that he or she want to do some other thing and take risks rather than what they have talented in .for example , in japan they have a famous singer name hikaru utada .she has very talented voice in singing and a lot of people likes to hear when she is singing .one day she said she want to go university in new york .most of the news talked about that moment .she was singing the song in united states and also she study hard in university of new york call columbia university .most of people knows that hikaru utada is successful person in japan .for another thing , most of the successful people have a lot of interesting emotion .they think what if he or she do this or that .for example , one of the famous japanese comedian star name hamada tries a lot of thing that he never tries .he tried most of the sports such as sky diving , gold , tenis and every other sports that this world exist .most of the successful person does everything that he or she is interest in .in conclution , successful people likes to take risks and also they have amount of interesting emotions .i never saw the famous people who is doing only that he or she already know how to do well .
