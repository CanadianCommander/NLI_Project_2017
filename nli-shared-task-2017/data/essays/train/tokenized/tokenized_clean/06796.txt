now there is a general debation that if it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specifis subject .different people have different ideas .as far as i am concerned , i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic .there are a lot of reasons supportion my idea , but i would only explain some of them due to the limited time .to begin with , if people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it will be easier for them to find jobs .that is to say that if you study a large amount of subjects , you may gain job oppotinities very quickly and chang job freely .a good example is the part-time job .if you have lots of knowledges of many academic subjects , you know both english and ecnomics well , then there will be many jobs readily available for you .working as a manager in a big company to show you ecnomics skill during weekdays , you may teach english in a training school , standing in front of the blackboard , pronounce `` a.b.c  .this experience will be extremely interesting for you , you must enjoy it very much .the second reason is that you may be more intelligent by studying many academic suvjects .a recent research has shown that people who learn knowledge in different areas will be more clever than those who only specialize in one soecific subjects because these people s idea mangaged to jump from one field to another field easily .the last reaons , as well as the most interesting reason is that people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more likely to be easygoing , in another word , they will develop better relationship with other people , in comparision with those who merely have knowledge in one specific subject .the reason is quite simple , these people can communicate with others well .for instance , if a person who learn some about history , as well as sport , it can be easily to make result these people are able to talk as well as chat with people who enjoy different interests .therefore , from what i mentioned above , it is reasonable to get the conclusion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialized in one specific subject .
