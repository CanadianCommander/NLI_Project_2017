in my country , there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fishes instead give fishes .it says important of learing not only the fact but also the `` the way  .but it highlight that the important of the way .like this old say , i agree that student to understand ideas and concets is more important than to learn facts .first , if students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions .for example , when i was middle school student , at first time of math class , i could nt understand what teacher said .but finally understood the way of solution , i could solve another math questions .although that question was more difficult , i understood the way of solution so i could do it .if i could nt understnad , i could nt solve that question .sesond , if student understand idea and concepts , they can imagine more idea nad concepts .i mean , for instance , when i was high school student , i learnd about poet .most of people do nt like poet because of words .that words were difficult to understood except teacher .teacher could understood all of words .that is why that is important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , i could nt understand because i didnt have any idea .so i agree about that statement .
