to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to learn many things in different fields of study .to specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view .in my opinion , it is better to have both of them as a part of your academical development , and they are both equally important .what truly happens in every person s academical development is that this person goes through different equally important stages .in the first stages of a childs life , this child learns how to speak , and then he or she learns how to write .this is general information that everyone should start with in the begining of their academic life .then comes school , whatever , or wherever this person gets their education is all called school ; although , there are some differences that occur on the level of that education .in school , people are taught all the essentials of life , and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , including different sciences , mathematics , arts , music , and languages .these are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life .as the school education comes to an end , different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests .later on in life , we are approached by university ; by we , i am reffering to the people who are looking at pursuing further education .university is where we are supposed to narrow our choices down , and choose specific fields of study .that is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject ; in other words , major in something they are attracted to .in the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives , and that is why they have to choose something they truly love .in conclusion , to have a broad knowledge on an academic subject , or to specialize in another are all equally important .you have to get a broad education first , and then narrow it down to what comforts you most .it is like , watching the rain fall , and then waiting for the rainbow to appear .from the first word a child learns at home to the last book this person reads , each and every stage in that persons life is important .
