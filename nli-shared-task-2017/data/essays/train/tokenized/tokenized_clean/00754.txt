most successful people already know how to do well .however i think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .thus , i agree that successful people have experience of trying new things and taking risks .there are several reasons .first of all , successful people have a lot of direct experience .for example , social experiences , leadership experiences , risk experiences , and so on .successful people offer lots of lessons to ours .if successful people do nt have a lot of experience , i ca nt liten about lessons .second , they are not successful people who already know how to do well .i have a personal experience .when i was 23 years old , i earned a ward about design .i had to design very hard every day .i had a good chance that i could already know concept choosing art s works .i could not recieve the ward .however , i can gain my famous but i was uncompertatal .i was not successful person .so i have not a computition and important meaning .to sum up , successful people
