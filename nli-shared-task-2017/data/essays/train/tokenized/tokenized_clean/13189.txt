new york city , 2026 .for a time-traveler from today , the city is hardly recognizable , for one main reason : cars have almost disappeared .where are all the yellow cabs , the traffic jams and the continuous flows of cars ?instead , there are electrical buses , and a few fuel cell cars , that only the richest can afford .is this assumption realistic ?in other words , will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ?in order to answe this question , i will evaluate the different factors that play a role in this issue .as we all know , oil and natural gas resources are doomed to be over by 50 or 60 years .in the meantime , their price will continue rising as it already does .this leads to assume that cars are going to become a luxury that fewer people will afford , and hence that the number of cars will decrease .furthermore , global warming is now being faced as a real issue for our planet , and fuel consumption by cars largely contributes to it .some governments are already raising taxes on gas , in order to make people reduce their use of cars .they also encourage public transport : 30 people in a bus represent a much smaller impact on environment than 30 people in their own cars .however , oil price rises and global warming are also faced with a more innovative approach .technologies are being developed which will allow cars to be cleaner for the environment .hybrid engines , cell fuels , electric engines , are probably what the future of cars is made of .as soon as the price of these technologies becomes effective and competitive compared to oil , we may expect a rise in the use of such cars .the remaining questions are mainly when this shift will happen , and whether the price of a car will be affordable .i think we may first expect an overall slow decrease of the number of cars in the next thirty years , followed by a rebound .maybe by that time our behaviour will have changed , public transport will have spread widely , and the rebound will not occur so much .but owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which leads me to assume that cars have a bright future .
