travelling in a group led by a tour guide have many advantages .first of all , it s the easiest way to learn about the new country , and it s culture , you are travelling in .most of the time , the tour guide has also many good advices , like where are the good spots located and what can be done , or what should nt be .you also probably feel more secure by travelling with a tour guide , than by travelling on your own .but despite all those advantages , i got to say that for me , there is nothing like travelling alone .because a trip must have a part of adventure , i mean you do nt really travel to feel secure , you travel to experience something new , you travel to discover new peoples , new cultures , new feelings , you travel to feel free , wich you really ca nt do when there is a tour guide telling you what to do and where to go ( eventhough it s better for you ) .but most of all , what i really would nt like to do , is travelling in a group .i remember when i was in africa with my dad , travelling on our own , when we met all those groups of french tourist with their guides .they were probably sleeping on better hostels than we did , their trip was probably way more `` comfortable  than ours , but i bet this was less interesting .and is nt paradoxical to travel , wich mean to leave your country , to be surrounded by people from the same country ?what s the purpose ?i d rather stay in france to be surrounded by french people . ..finally i would say that even if it appears easiest to travel in a group led led by a tuor guide , you will never learn the the same things than by travelling on your own .and to me travelling is about learning >
