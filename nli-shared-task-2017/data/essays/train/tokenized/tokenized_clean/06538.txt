i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do .both these are the stages of life and people enjoy at every stage .but , i feel that people get more enjoyment at old age .in young stage , people strive to earn their lives for themselves , for their children and for their parents .they always work and work to earn more money , more status etc to earn living at that point of time and to save money or invest money for later part of life , which is older age .real enjoyment starts when they use the money earned for enjoyment as they are having more free time for enjoyment .secondly , old age is the last stage of life when people have seen all the wordly pleasure of life during their various stages of life .but , in my viewpoint , people gets more satisfaction when they are with complete family including their grand children .that is the stage when people feel more enjoyment to be with .people earn money for getting this phase of life with good times .thirdly , i feel that in old age , people can do any work according to their liking because they are under no pressure to earn their life .but , in young age , people remains under pressure to fulfill their dreams and always running after life .in old age , life comes to a stand still and people enjoy the fruits of the trees what they have planted in young age .because of this reason , old age people gets more satisfaction during that time as compared to young age .lastly , in old age , people gets more respect in the society which in turn gives more enjoyment towards life .people at this stage can indulge in activities like temple work , which helps them in soothing their soul .beyond this there is no enjoyment on earth which humans can get .i would like to retierate that people enjoy more in old age as compared to young age .
