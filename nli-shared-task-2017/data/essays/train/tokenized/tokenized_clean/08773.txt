advertisements sometimes are just an information that not show the true , it is just a way to show and offer the product .all the products have to have an advertisement , but sometimes this kind of ads only show the common rules that all the products must have .in my opinion advertisments must show the true composition of the product , no matter if it significate a major cost for the company who produce this kind of products .advertisments are very important because they show us if that product is correct or no for our consume .i agree with most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , some products show qualities that are nt true when you consume it , the only thing that they concern its sell their products no matter if it is so good or no .they try to hide some details , and that details can be harmful for some people .a lot of peolple ca nt consume some ingredients , for example a diabetic person should nt taste sugar , but if an advertisment do nt show the quantity of sugar that the product have , this product is harmful for that person , even can cause an intoxication .i think we must create a rule for advertisments , all of the products should have a complety list of ingredients and the quantity and quality of these , the products must be clasificated .to conclude i can say that advertisment sometimes can be entertaiment but sometimes can be cheerfully , all we have to do is look and try to find the real purpose of the product .
