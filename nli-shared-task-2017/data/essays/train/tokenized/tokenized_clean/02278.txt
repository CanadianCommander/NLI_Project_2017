i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are many disadvantages to follow the tour guide .even getting a tour guide can be harmful and dangerous for tourists .first of all , when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel , you only can see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group .you can not find out around of city .everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide .for example , you want to see other side of city , but there is a certain travel program which includes to see certain place in the city .you have to follow the travel program .second of all , people who are from that city can understand that you are tourist .this sutation has some dangeours point .they can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensive .for example , when you go to a store for shopping , if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive , but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist .so people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you in original price .third of all , is traveling with groups not expensive activity but also it is a so dangerous .there are many terrorits people or groups who want to kidnapp to tourists and foreigner people to come true their bad purposes .those kind of people can realize that you are a tourist , because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide .they can kidnapp you and kill you .furthermore they can use you for their purposes .that situtaion happenned the tourists many times .those people killed the tourist or got money from the tourist of family .in above , there are many advantages about traveling alone and following the tour guide .the quite proverb says that `` it does not matter whatever travelling alone and following tour guide cost , people can listen their heart and make their ways for travelling .that s why we have to travel alone .
