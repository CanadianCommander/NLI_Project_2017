during our lifecycle , we encounter different periods due to our age and we have to obey to bear certain roles .we try to make a promising future in our younger period whereas we bear more responsibility in our older period .but when it comes to enjoying life , does younger people have more fun compared to the older people ?i think not , even though it seems so .in younger periods of life , we will be persisting , keeping on trying to make a promising `` future  for ourselves .every progress in means of academic performance of fields of business is for making a basis for our future .in short , we invest , to gain a future .furthermore , we have less responsibilities , which may seem to be priceless for many people but not for me .having less responsibilities means that you have less control and effect in your life .when you are a child , your mum will buy your clothes , chooses the meals you eat and even takes stesp in your early academic life .so , you are dependent on your family in your early lifetime .as you grow and become older you will increase the span of your responsibilities .additionally , younger people lack may be the most important aspect of success and survival in life : experience .younger people are worse in decision making and successing in every field they are introduced to as new .does being young has nothing to have fun ?absolutely there are some .you can party like crazy , live being dependent on your family and pay no care .everything seems to be in order and you do not have to deal with that , then why not just have fun of it ?as i mentioned earlier , this is an illusionary situation and one have to know that his/her family will not take care of him forever , so he/she has to invest for his/her future .when we look into life through the older stages of lifecycle , everything is established and in order .we `` harvest  our investment of younger periods and have fun of it .we have established what we dreamed of and we have reached the point , the point of success in our heads .therefore , i thing one will be satisfied with his/her life in their older periods .now , we have the responsibility of our life , even the lives of our children or others , like our employees .another point is that we have the most experience in our older periods , we know how to study , how to be persistent to reach goals and even how to have the most fun out of life !to conclude , i strictly reject the idea of being younger means enjoying life more .in my opinion , being younger means that you are an unexperienced , unestablished passenger of the travel through life ; whereas being older means that you are experienced and you are established .the advantages i have stated throughout this essay of of being older will lead to enjoying life more than the younger ones .
