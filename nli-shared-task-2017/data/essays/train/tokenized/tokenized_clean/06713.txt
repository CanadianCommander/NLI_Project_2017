i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .as i said i do nt agree because i am also a young people and i also do nt spend that much time on my communities .i think that it is because we , young people do not have enpough time to spend their time on there communities because of their homeworks .they has too much homework , so they can not really concentrate what they need to do for themselves , they always get messed up in middle of their homework , they always start crying .also another reason that i think is that they always spend their time to play their video games .they always thiink about finishing the game ina year or some what like that .and also the bad thing about the video games is that their eyes will get bad .as they do not limite how much time you can play video games a day , your eyes will burn some day .( which means that you wo nt be able to see anything with out the horrile glasses . )the horrible thing about getting your eyes getting burned is thetyou wo nt be able to see anything without your glasses .as you wake up on the morning and open your eyes you will always start off the day with the blurry world .and the world will change for ever .sometimes when my mother tells me that one of her friend that got a burnt eye took a surgry and got his/her normal eye back my mom s friend said `` i never knew that the world was this beatiful  as she was amaze her eyes again became burt again .so even though you take a surgery of your eyes it wo nt be any good .so these were the reasoning that why i agreed with young people now adays do not give enough time to helping their communities .and my own opinion is that myself also do nt give enough time helping my communities myself .
