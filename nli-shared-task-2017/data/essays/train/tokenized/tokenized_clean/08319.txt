i strongly agree that `` young people enjoy life more than than older people do  for whole lot of reasons .first of all people at young age are not bothered about any responsibilities .they are free birds and they like to enjoy their life to fullest .for example right now i an doing my graduation and i am not at all bothered about anything , i enjoy a lot with my friends , go for parties , have get togethers , we watch lot of movies .i never think about future , i like to take the life as it comes .whereas when i see my parents they are lot more concerned about different issues in life , like they are bothered about their life after retirement , or the burden of their kids .the next thing is people at young age try to be adventerous , innovative in their thoughts and ideas .they try out some thing or the other to keep their life intresting .they expect some kind of thrill in their life .whereas the elder people doesnot want to try out new things and they prefer to spend a stable and peaceful life .people at young age are very healthy compared to the elder people .they are with full vigor .the health problems of elderly may keep them away from enjoying the life to the fullest .like for example most of the elderly people may have problems with blood pressure or may have cardiac problems or may have arthritis or any kind of problem .so these people generally tend to keep their life in subtle way and try to avoid all the noises or try to live in peace and serenity .finally the elder people may not be knowing the latest innovations because of which they may be deprived of enjoyment .like for example my grandparents doesnot know how to use the computers and they are not intrested to know .so the enjoyment which i get while browsing the internet and knowing whole lot of things , which made my life easier can be defenitely compared to what my grandparents are missing .so for all these reasons i strongly believe that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
