for my it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learn more .the diferentes materials : arts , science , mathemathics , literature , politic , world , economy , languagues , cook , technology , history .learn to the watherver topic , or subject , realize a person .most learn most prepared to great job in anything work .wao !need talk about all topics with all people and help in different material .and specialize in one specific subject realize people `` genious  on the specialization .special people , learn about science for example and specialize in this maerial have big concement in the cotidians jobs .in my opinion learn the all academics subjects realize the people or much very intellectual people .maybe readding more books , less television , more educational programs .whn travel at other country , learn the other cultures , your idioms , custums , religion .the world is totally different and more learnd of the other materials more prepared for any situation .noy bad for specializa in specifict subject no , no .no .but always y need learn , i nead have a knowledge for evrethyng topic .i like i enjoy knowledge .this my live .i am play instrument and learn evreday at the other materials .it s so funny learn , funny and intersting .
