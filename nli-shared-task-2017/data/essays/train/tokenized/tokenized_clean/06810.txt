the happiest period in one s life is young age .it is a period of learning , enjoyment , base for future life , healthier life .so i feel that young people enjoy more than older people .firstly young age is the period where people learn a lot .they learn about interaction with others .they learn about various subjects , & of nature .they even do specialisations in various fields which become profession to earn money .this forms the base for the future life .because it is the period to earn money for future and for eenjoyment .this is also period to learn other skills for relaxation as well as for entertainment .it is a period of learning skills because they have good memory and intelligence .secondly , it is a period of enjoyment .because people can spend much time with friends , relatives , family members .at this age people can also move freely to different placesin search of work , see different places , enjoy holidays .they can even enjoy by reading books , playing with children where as older people can not spend time with family members mostly because of their stay away from them due to studies or work .older people loss interest in things as they grow older so they do not enjoy every thing surrounding them .thirdly , young age is the healthy period in health point of view .as older people face many problems of old age such as dementia - loss of memory , general weakness , and various other problems relating to old age .finally , i conclude that young people enjoy more than older people because of their intelligence , memory , interest , and lastly support of the health .
