there are some people who likes to go with tour guides in a big group when they travel overseas and even in domestic tour .it is not the case for me .i like travel by my self .there are three reasons why i like travel by myself and i disagree with the statement above , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because it would be impossible in groups to go places that i want , delay the flight , and not buying lots of suveniors .first , it will be impossible to drop by the places that i wanted to go .if i go in a tour guided groups , group ca nt go wherever i want to go but where people in group agreed to go .it is impossible to get out of tour guide  itinerary too because of the safety reasons what they call .for example , i will be really sad not dropping by at the most famous cholate store in san francisco when other might think it is waste of time .second , it is impossible to delay my flight .groups move by itineraries that have assigned long before by tour companies .the tour guide would want to go as many places as they think in a short time .what if i want to stay in tour area for a while for a nice , bronze tan i wanted to get in france ?what if i fall in love which hot italian guy who is really good at kissing ?i would want to delay my flight for a week or so .is that possible for touring in goup ?no way .some people might say , `` i miss korea , i want kimchi !  when others do nt .third , tour guides tend to take tour groups to tons of suvenior shop .just like leashing dog off from owner , tour guides spares many hours in suvenior shop thinking that people might want to buy lot s of them and take it home .i do nt go traveling to buy suveniors .it would be wasting of time , spending three hours in duty free shop .in conclusion , traveling in group is not attractive to me because , if i go traveling , i want to spare more time knowing and leaning the place that i go by willing to spare more time and efforts on trying to know what i want .so , it is not the best idea to travel in group led by a tour guide .
