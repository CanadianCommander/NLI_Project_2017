well , my over all preceptions about advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i disagree with this statement for several reasons .firstly , i think that many advertising companies advertise for the matter of money not more .secondly , i know that many products do not deserve a very big advertising through a personal experience .many famous companies advertise for their products to attract people to buy it or to love it in some ways .what i mean that is advertising companies looks for a something which all people love it and tries to put it in the advertisement .as we know pepsi is one of the most companies that advertises for its product .and all people know that pepsi is very harmfull after if we drink it for a long time .well people didnt say that .scientists said that and due to many experiments on pepsi .people also can discover by them selves that pepsi is not good .a very simple test , bring a broken teeth and put it in a pepsi cup .you will soon discover after a couple of hours that their is no teeth .in addition to my first example which proves to people that pepsi is very harmfull and they always advertise for it on tv .i would like to talk on another example which is junk food .i watch tv for around 4 to 6 hours each day and i can see alot of advertising for macdonalds and burgerking .if a normal person sees these advertisement , he thinks that jumk food is good , while its also very bad .junk food may lead to cancer disease and block in heart artries .its full of harmfull oil which is used several times .some people are also overwaited from junk food .all doctors advices to stay away of junk food .in fact advertsement people are professional and they know how to affect people through these advertisements .and as far as i know and i think its not fair and also its not legal to try to cheat on people .i take this as a cheating method because when they are advertising you think its a good product and it suits you .
