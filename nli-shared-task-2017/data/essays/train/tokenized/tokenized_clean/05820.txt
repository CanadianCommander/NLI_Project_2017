knowledege is something which we gain everyday .thus it should include learning of various subjects equally but not speacializing in one of them only .according to me speacializing in a single subject is not always useful because of various reasons .firstly , it is not helpful in certain difficult situations where knowledge about the specific thing is required .for example incase of short circuit it is important for the person to know what steps to take .for this the knowledge of physics is required , it is similar in the case of bleeding or any other physical injury , the basic knowledge in first aid , learnt in human sciences is required .hence in practical sense knowledge of various subjects is of great importance .secondly , it is more demanding in these mordern days .people are not really sure of being successful in a particular feild hence it is always safe to have equal knowledge about evrything as it will enable us to take up any proffession in futre .as according to famous economist gunnar myrdal `` education should be such that it should generate employment in any feild taken up by the educated .thus broad knowledge ensures employment oppurtunities at a better rate as compared to knowledge gained in a specific feild .thirdly , knowledge about a variety of subjects would not bore the person but it will make it interesting for him as he will concentrate on different subjects rather than a single one .fourthly , even quiz competitions lay emphasis on equal learning of all the subjects .the questions asked in such competitions are related to different subjects .hence even in knowledge testing and gaining competitions like the quiz competitions show that broad knowledge is better as compare to speacialized knowledge in a specific subject .
