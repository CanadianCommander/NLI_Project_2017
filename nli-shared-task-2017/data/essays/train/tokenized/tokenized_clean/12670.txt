it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .it has been controversail issue weather it is good for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .some people may insist that student specialize in one specific subject in terms of saving times .as for me , however , i believe that it is desirable for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for the following two reasons : not only develop varies knowledge but also enhande sence of responsivility .firstly , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to develop many kind of knowledge .if one student will study five subjects for one year he can study many things .they make him to smart on varies section .additionally , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to enhande sence of responsivility .studing many academic subjects is very hard work .but during a studing times he can learn sence of responsivility .
