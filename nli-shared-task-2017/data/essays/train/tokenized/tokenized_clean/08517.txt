i personally agree with the statement that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learning the facts because for a student getting to understand many facts is very important before applying it on .for example , let us take a student who in school stage appears for an exam .if he prepares a particular lesson in the syllabus by mere mugging or learning the facts in the textbook without getting to understand the concept and the idea of about what the lesson expresses , it would be very difficult for him to pen down on his examination because one cant rely basically only on the memory .what if the student gets tensed as soon as he sees the question of that particular portion .being more anxious could result in palpitations and tends to forget what he memorised , may not put forth the answer .instead if the student would have made just to understand about the idea and concept then it would be easy for him to put forth and develop in his own words too which may actually be an expressive thought and eventually fetch him more marks .take an other example of a research student .a reasearch paper to be completed needs lots of informations which should be compiled properly to meet the requirements of the research study .for this to happen a students tries to gather many information and materials , take notes , read .establish in mind how to put in orders needs lots of ideas .only if he could understand the basic concept of that particular subject or paper he can develop new ideas which will fetch him good notes to complete a research paper eventually winning praises for his work which shows confidence .this will be very useful for the student if he is asked to deliver a paper presentation , because he has already understood the concept and the basic idea which has given him the confidence to express and deliver in public gathering .another example could also be taken which was proved , that is the newton s law of gravity .just because newton had the capacity to understand his topic to be invented his thought process welcomed the idea and thus the law of gravity was exposed to the world .if he would have just learned the fact probably till now the law of gavity wouldnt have been in exixtence .thus i come to the conclusion that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn merely the facts only and i stand for my choice .
