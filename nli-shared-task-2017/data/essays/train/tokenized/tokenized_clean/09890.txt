in my point fo view the successful people try new things risks rather then only doing what they already know .so meny people like successfull men s or women s there are will at studes and jobs there are coming from good background at studers and envornment .they think about what .why , how and so and so question .the people like will at studes and think in different way the people the learn new thinks .they want to learn think s for usefull so they want to learn new think s taking risk rather current .for example take take on software proffeson .for example he is working java technology .he is good at java and successfull working on java , but in that some new things are add to the java technology for example swings , hiber net .it is uses full for the next project .so that person learn that things taking the risk rather tan the doing what they alresdy .successful people try new things for developing thre future .for second example we take music payers they work at some instruments only , but they want learn the new things in the music .thay tearn the things taking the high risk then the doing things .i thing that the person is successed that is he or she taking the risk on that what they do and doing things .so many successful people successed by taking the risk and interst in thar pariclar takes .so meny risk and hard work give the so much result to the humen s .we agree with the statement .
