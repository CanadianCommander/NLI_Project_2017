in student s life learning is very important ; the tipical day of a student consists mainly of learning .although almost all students learn a lot and consider learning an essential factor , it is important to analyze how they learn .that is , one should consider the objectives and the focus of a student who is learning .quite often students learn new topics but forget them after a while .the reason for this might be the way how they were learning .in my opinion , it is much more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that is it for them to learn facts .in the following i will give reveral reasons to support my statement .firstly , learning does not mean learning by hard , that is `` memorizing facts  , but understanding of ideas .if a person learns by hard , he will tend to forget the notions learned as soon as he does not need or treat them anymore .secondly , learning should not just be finalized to get high scores in a short time , but should enable students to apply the concepts they have learned and extend them also to other situations .tirdly , learning constitute the basis of research .in order to be able to make research in a given area , it is essential to understand all what is connected to it .if i consider my experience , i think that understanding ideas is really essential for your profession later on and i would suggest to support students .for instance , common discussions help students to verify if they understood a concept correctly or not .in some other cases , it could be helpful to apply a concept in a study , in a use case or in the laboratory .in summary , i am convinced that learning facts is not sufficient for students .it will not enable them to proceed on their own in an area .on the contrary , i consider understanding of ideas and of concepts as beeing essential in the learning process .
