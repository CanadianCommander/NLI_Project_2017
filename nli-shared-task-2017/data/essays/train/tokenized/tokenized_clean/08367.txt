i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .my opinion is based upon the following reasons :first , the number of the oppotuinities to contact the communities has been decreasing because of the development of internet or other erectiric device or the increase of hard-working life styles .nowadays , we will finish almost all businesses without facing any person of our communities .for example .in my childhood .security for criminal was regarded as one of the most important role of a commnity .however , recently , the security has been thought of as one of the most significant facilities of a house or an apartment themselves .i believe most japanese people depend on the security facilities rather than their communites .second , young people tend to seek for more interesting or stimulaous lives .except for a few arban areas , i believe most young people feel boring in their lives .in quest of stimlus , many young people will reject and leave their own commnities .third , there is the shortage of effective resorces to provide young people with the imformation on the oppotunities to be asked toward young people to take part in .so , if young people are interested in the activities in their commnities , they will not able to use such oppotunities effectivelly .fourth , there is no education on how important people are involved in their communities .it is very impotant to contact with their communities because such contacts will bring about the discovery regarding the affairs closest to us and make our life more enjoyable .in additon , as i stated belore and has been intensively discussed .the relationship between young people and their commnunities are essential to precause criminal affairs or other dangerous things .for these reasons , i agree the above statement .
