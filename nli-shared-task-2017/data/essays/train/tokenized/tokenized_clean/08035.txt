i agree with the fact that most advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .of course when you watch television a lot of infomations and pictures goes in your brain .you record all you have seen and after you want to buy it it s a fact .but when you go in a restaurent for exemple sometimes you are very desapointed because it does nt look at all with what you ve seen on television .the producers are really strong because they can make an illusion of lot a things and the people fall in this illusion .i have a personal exemple for this situation .last nignt i was watching television and i saw an advertisement about the newest cell phone .the commercial said that he is very small , one the most resistant . ..in fact one of the most everything .when i went in the cell phone shop indicated on the advertisement i discover that the phone was very big that he was nt at all resistant and in fact that he was very bad .i understood after that it was only a commercial witch make me go to the cell phone store to buy an another phone .i got punked by this wrong advertisements .and i do nt think i am the only one who leave this experience in fact i believe that everyday people like me do the same thing but some people sometimes does nt go back like me and on the contrary enter in this vicious circle .it s the purpose of those commercial .it s to send you somewhere to make you buy something you did nt need at first .but whe cant always said that the commercial are trying to play with us .sometimes the commercials are true and show us true things .they do nt play this game often ( make product seem much better tan they really are ) because in this case a lot of person will be sent to jail !
