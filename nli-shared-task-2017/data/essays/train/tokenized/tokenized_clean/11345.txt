the use of cars today is almost `` automatic  in our society .most households have at least one vehicle and people use their car for any purpose , from major trips to going to pick up groceries down the street .however , the use of cars is being threatened by the lack of oil the world will be facing soon .on the other hand , the use of car threatens our environment , contributing to the pollution of our atmosphere and to global warming .what will the consequences be in twenty years ?will there be fewer cars or just higher pollution ?what solutions will we find ?so many questions to answer , so little time , and so much of our everyday life and comfort affected . ..i think that our society , in order to be able to have the many cars we have today , will need to find solutions to our biggest problems .first of all , we are already facing the problem of the decreasing amount of oil leading to the price explosion of gasoline .exploiting oil becomes more and more expensive and rare , and it is starting to affect everyone who owns a car .any trip or use of the vehicle becomes pricy , and as a result , more and more people consider using public transportation .i think this will eventually lead people to a better understanding of what the society as a whole can do : if there are fewer cars , it reduces the pollution and helps the environment .from an individual point of view , using public transit will become cheaper as gasoline prices will go up .for those reasons , and because i want to be optimistic , i think there will be fewer cars in twenty years .people will realise how much money owning a car represents and most households will simply not be able to afford it .nonetheless , if governements and innovative corporations start to work hands in hands , solutions to find better environment-friendly resources to replace gasoline will appear .as a result , people will be able to buy vehicles that work with elecricity or natural gas , and will be able to keep using their private means of transportation .in this case , we will tend to see more cars than today , as the world population tends to grow .some solutions have already started to show up and enable us to keep confidence in the future .however , i do believe that we are reaching the highest point of consumption today .i doubt there will be more cars in the future , and i really hope people will consider public transportation as a great alternative , for the sake of everybody as well as for the preservation of our environment .
