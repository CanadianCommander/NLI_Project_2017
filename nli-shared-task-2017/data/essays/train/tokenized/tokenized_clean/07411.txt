enjoying your life is very crucial because you only have one opertunity .some say that they enjoyed life more when they were young and did not have any worries .others say that only in age could they realize what they really wanted and could enjoy their life to a full extent .i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older ones .to explain my view i will give an exaple of an unhappy young person , who was not able to enjoy her life and then i will give an example of an older one who did .a friend of mine who finished school together with me was just as clueless as i was when deciding about what we wanted to study .we both decided to take a year off .this year was supposed to give us the oppertunity to discover more about ourselves and realize what we wanted to do .i took this seriously and pushed myself to make a lot of new experiences , which have now helped me to decide about my future .she wanted to enjoy her life .she partied and drank as much as she could because she thought that this would be the right way of satisfing herself .however , she was wrong .she now realized that that was not what she needed .she had not been mature enough to see what she really required to make her happy and to enjoy herself .in this case more maturity would have been of great benefit .one the contrary to this in the last couple of weeks i had gotten to know many old people who did know how to enjoy themselves .i started to work in a nursing home for older people .there more than anywhere else i have aquainted people who are in really bad situations but still know through their lifelong experiences how they can enjoy themselves .one specific example would be a 87 year pld woman who had a stroke and consequently had to lie in bed the whole time .most young people in this situation would be terribly unhappy .she lives with her fate and any time you enter her room she smiles at you .it is easy to watch how small things can make her enjoy herself imensly .the two example that i have made show that enjoying yourself has nothing to do with being younger .i do admit that not all old be know how to still enjoy their life .however , they are ofthen in a far worse situation than any young person is .in general i think that the more experiences you make the more you learn about yourself .this brings on a process of maturing , which shows you what is important to you and how you can enjoy yourself .
