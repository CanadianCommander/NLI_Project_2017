succesful people can be diferent depend of the enviroment or the culture apliance .the way that people do things or use the knowledge to do it can be a common factor in succesful peple .in my opinion successful people start to succed in the enviroment that they knows well .for example , a computers experts will start his achivements working on his field , computers .but that dos nt , means that he will be successful just in his mayor .one person can succed in many aspects , like his or she personal live , spiritual live , etc .dos nt exist one rule that say to succed you need do just the things that you know how to do , but also dos nt exist a rule that say you need tray other fields .in my personal opinion the kay to succed is just be free of take the risk of living .normaly starting with some field that you can work with but thinking that maybe some day other horizont will be opened in other way a unknown way .for example , a representative sale in one shoe store acchive his goals as a sles man increasing the number in fifty percent .but the owner that posses one car dealer shop offert to him other job , with better conditions and benefits .the guy start as a shoe sales man but his way to sales shoes gave the idea to the owner of the shop to put him in a new job mannager of one car dealer shop .clearly shoes are no the same of cars .on the other hand , sales is not the same that mannagment , but the quality is the imperor factor .in that way the quality found for the owner of the shoe store and the car dealer shop is not related to shoes or car is related to the person , the actitude , and the capacity of use his pre - knowledge to learn something new .the key of succed is just a combination of desire and knowledge .using as a spark the knowledge tha we posses and being ready to any change with the capacity to adappt own and learn new challenges i sthe key to succed .is like successful people get the achivment of their goals .
