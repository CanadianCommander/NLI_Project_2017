i certainly agree with the stament .all the famous people or the people who became self made men , tried new things taking their risks .it is very hard being a succesfull people doing only what you already know how to do well .all the tycoons in the world like bill gates , rupert murdoch or the italian silvio berlusconi began succesfull people discovering new ways of busisness or taking big risks in investiments of money .this is the only way to become an important person in the busisnes s world .another reason to support this thesis is on the fact that is quite harder to being a successful man in a busisness field where there is lot of competition .so is much easier , once you have found an idea , to make money in a new field of the busisness world .because at the beginning you do not have any competitor and you could create a `` monopolio  that gives you the possibility to earn a lot money .for istance the richest person in the world , bill gates , had became himself by discovering and inventing a new kind of busisness that before him was nt operating , or it was operating but was not that famous .he took a lot of risks at the beginning starting this new business but now he is the most rich in all the world , so we can say that he had a brilliant idea .another reason is t that the successful people who take risks usually have very determinated characters , that certainly help in the challenge .and people who win challenges often became successful in their own field .and last but not least there is a proverb that explain in few words exactly the reason of why i agree with the statement .and the proverbn says : `` no pain no gain  .
