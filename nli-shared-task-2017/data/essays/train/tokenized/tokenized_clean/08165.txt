wether it is better to have a broad or a specific knowledge depends esentialy of the point of view : if you are looking at the society general interest or at the individual interest .eficiency is one of the main argument in favor of knowledge specialization , because it is certainly harder to master a great variety of topics than to focus on a narrow topic .specialization is one of the main reasons of the great achievements of modern science .today s scientists are capable of very complex theories and projects because they are all very specialized .a botanist would not mix with quantics , because he would loose some time in getting the basis , whwn he could have developed a little further a study on a peculiar animal behaviour .so for science and more widely for the human race specialization is better .but as human being and individuals we need equilibrium which is achieved only throught a wider horizon of knowledge .if your goal is self fulfillement then you will be better of knowing a large panel of topics .that is why during our elementary and most of our secondary studies we are studying a large panel of fields in order to get a solid background on which people can build their minds .and it is valable even in the scientific world , when some of the most extrordinary discoveries have been made throught interdisciplinar studies .like mixing ordinary chemistry with biology you discover the extraordinary possibilities of using one to dicover more of the other .you can dicover some intresting molecules in some animals or plants and you can better understand how the brain works if you know chemistry .i will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary , and only then you can specialize in your own field .
