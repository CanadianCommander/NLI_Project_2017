there are many benefits related with travelling in a group led by a tour guide , such as opportunities to make friends among the group members , and a fixed itinerary which reduces the risks of getting lost .however , i believe that the benefits of travelling alone outweigh the benefits of travelling in a group in many ways : personal time management , tailored travel routes , and budgeting .firstly , it is important to have a detailed plan with specific tour locations and times in order to effeciently organize and run a tour where many people are involved .this means that certain locations of interest may not be visited or may not receive as much tour time as one may desire .locations and time allocations would be based more on the overall benefit of the group , rather than the specific interests of the individual .therefore , by travelling alone , one could exclusively tour the locations one is interested in and allocate as much time as one wants in viewing the location .the organization of the itinerary would be up to the individual traveller , allowing him to map out his own travel routes and `` design  his own trip .also , travelling alone would allow the traveller to budget the spendings specifically to his needs .the traveller could significantly reduce costs in unnecessary spendings related to visiting areas of little interest , and increase spendings in local food culture or buying souvenirs .the areas of spending could be adapted to what each individual traveller desires , depending on what part of the tour they want to concentrate their tour spenditures .moreover , cheaper transportation and accomodations can be adapted into the plan of an individual traveller .however , in a group setting , travellers are charged with a lump-sum amount where little room for personal interests and budgeting decisions is allowed .in conclusion , i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i believe this may be true in the case of people of old age , who are more comfortable with a mapped-out plan and a tour guide leading the way .however , i believe travelling should involve adventure and discovering places which genuinely interest me .therefore , in my opinion , travelling alone gives me the freedom to live the trip the way i want to and to discover the places i desire , creating a much better tour experience overall .
