everybody has heard about future cities which respect the enviroment , with no cars and lots of yards where you can go anywhere using the public transport t and what is more important , with no pollution .but is it only a dream or will it become true anyday ?firstly , everypeople know that the car as a form of transport is getting old and that in this age of technology , modern forms of transport are developping , but millions of people use their cars everyday , even to go to nearby places .this abusive use of cars raises pollution , acustic problems and other effects like the global warming or the greenhouse effect caused by the gases that cars , between other things , take to the atmosphere .furthermore , most cars , more than 99 % , use fossils fuels .these fossils fuels not only cause pollution , they also are estimated to be exhaust by less than 30 years .it means that cars like we know now wo nt be used in twenty , thirty or fourty years instead of other cars which consume other fuels will be in use .besides , projects like ecocities and many managements from different cities promove the public transport , creating new lines or just making the public transport available now cheaper .at least in theory , these facts contribute to reduce the use of cars .as far as i am concerned , i believe that cars whose fuels are made by vegetables sustances like oils will remplaced our cars , but i am not sure at the time to affirm that there will be fewer cars in the future .big cities have usually traffic jams and problems with car parkings and the noise that they causes and it is true that public transport are growing faster now .but on the other hand , i think that some people can find cars so comfortable and that car will still be use for many years .in conclusion , i hope that there will be fewer cars in twenty years , and i certaintly believe that , but who can know about the future ?
