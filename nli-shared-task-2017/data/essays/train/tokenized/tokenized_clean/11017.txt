in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group and with a tour guide , because when you travel wtih more people is more fun and specially if is leading by a tourist guide , he will know the best places to visit .if you go to visit another country is important to by led by a tourist guide , because usually you will not know anything about this place , or country .he will know the most popular places and they way to get to them .if you go to another country , they people from this country maybe speak another lenguaje , in this case is going to be difficult to find the places were yo will like to go specially if you get lost .there is when the tourist guide will be helpful , he will know the lenguaje of the country making things easier for the group .another reason is that tourist guides know a large amount of history , in this way when you are visting museums for example the tourist guide will tell you all the important details of the hystory of the place you are visiting , making the trip more interested .in addition to that the idea of learnig the history of a country , is more fun with a group of people .in conclusion a group travel led by a tour guide it will make any trip more enjoyable , because the tourist guide will make the trip with less worries , and the group of people that you travel with , will make any trip a trip to remember .
