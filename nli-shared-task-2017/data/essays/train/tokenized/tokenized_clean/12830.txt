in todays era of exponentially evolving technology everybody seems to be entangled in the race to outcompete the rest , to overshadow others in terms of accomplishment , success , fame , power and superiority .technology is meant to make life simpler but are we really achieving that .todays youth , in the process of mastering the expertise of desiging a robot , which can perform any task you ask it to , have them selves beocome like one - a robot .we work only towards are selfish goals and gains .our life revolves aroud words like i , me , mine .gradually we are becoming detached to our families , society and community .our perspective has narrowed down .we do not see beyond our selves .we do not think about our society and nation .nobody takes responsibilty or authority to improve the system .everybody dreams about landing on the surface of moon and mars but nobody really has the time to see what is happening to our earth , to our people .pests like terrorism , global warming , racialism , poverty , economic disparity , nuclaer arms race have crippled us and need to be seriously considered and eradicatd before they cause complete decimation of mankind from the face of the earth .many of our natural resources are nearing extinction due to reckless overuse and lack of repletion .who shall take the inititative to replenish them ?natural resouces are gifts of nature to us which are to be judiciously used and passed on to our next generations .technology and education should not only be aimed at exploring new areas but also to attend to prevailing problems of todays world order .who else has to take this inititative if not the youth of the world .they are the pioneers of tommorrow .the buds which shall bloom and become the architects of our future .even if each individual youth , in his modest capacity , decide to make some contribtution towards restructuring and refurbishment of the society , solution to a lot of problems will emerge .afterall the purpose of education is not just to cram books , make warships , look through a microscope but to make this earth a better place to leave .it is the moral responsibiltity of the youth to unite against and fight social predators .
