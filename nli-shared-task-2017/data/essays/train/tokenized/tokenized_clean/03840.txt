i disagree with the statement .because i think ideas and concepts are made by people .if each of the people lives in different countries , each of ideas and concepts are different even though they think about same thing .for example , i would like to talk about world war 2 .my grandfather joind the war as a soldier when he was 20s .his idea is that the war was made by several countries governments .the japanese government is one of them .my brother said that did the japanese government start the war when he saw a movie ` pearl harvar  .he had little doubt it at that time although he had already learned the war at hisory classes for more than ten years ago .some korean friends asked me if i felt guilty for the war and korean .all of these ideas are not official statements .but i am sure many people have same ideas as those people .they knew about some of the facts .i think if i understand each of ideas without the facts , it is not real understanding .when i want to understand some ideas and concepts , i should focus on what the ideas and concepts were caused by .this is the most important thing for understanding .
