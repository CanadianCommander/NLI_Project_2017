people have different opinions about whether they should travel in a group led by a tour guide or not .in my opinion , i strongly support the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of several reasons .first of all , a tour guide knows where is the most wonderfull palces .people do not want to spend their money and time by going to unexcited palces and they want to see somthing they have never seen in their life .last year i went to canada and i did not know about niagra falls , but when i joined a group has a tour guide he took us their and that was one of the best places i have ever seen in my life because i did not know about that before .another reason to support the idea for having a tour guide is that usually a guide knows the best way to go to the palces that we need .we could save time insead of using maps or gps and wasting time and our vacation looking for the directions or asking people in the street how to go home back .my father went to new york and he could not find 5th ave. and he spent all the day looking for it in the map .finally , when we have a tour guide usually we will go by the same can or in a big bus so we do not need to spend money to rent a car .i went with my wife and we both were happy because we did not worry about having a car which will cost us alot of money .to sum up , this reasons that i cited are about traveling in a group led by a tour guide when we travel insead of traveling alone .if we talvel in a group has a tour guide we will enjoy the trip and spend most of the time by going to places we did not know about it and in the same time we could save
