many teenagers seem to just hang out with themselves and not help their communities .however , this is wrong .students are actually helping the community they live in with small things such as keeping the community clean , and helping the elders and disabled people .these days , almost all the schools are requiring the students to go to the government-related areas and help others for certain hours per year .because they get their marks off the grades , most students go to where the elders are , or to kindergartens to help out community people by cleaning and helping chores .for example , a students will go to the daycare center and help the teachers -- or leaders -- take care of the kids and entertain them .helping them serving snacks and doing dishes will be another way to help the society .also , once in two weeks , students are to go outside the school building and are required to pick up small trash and garbages that are litered inside the school .even if it is just inside the school , it will help the school to look clean and organized .just like these , students are helping the community behind the adults  eyes .when you go on the public transportation , such as subways or buses , it is easy to notice a young student giving up their seat to someone who is carrying a heavy object , or someone who is old and hard to support themselves by standing .this small thing can also be a big help to the society .others will learn this act from this student and will repeat the same act to help others .the student will also feel warm about what he/sho had done .another example is that teenagers can help foreigners by just answering them how to get somewhere very kindly .it is often for students to help others is minor things , but adults just think that the students do nt help the community at all .there are more things that adults could help for the society , but not much for the young people .young people do nt have enough money to help others , when adults do .they do nt have abilities to help other people in such a big scale .instead , they help others with minor things and be satisfy with it .people who say that young people do not help the community should think about themselves if they help the community within their abilities .
