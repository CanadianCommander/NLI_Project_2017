what s the goal of advertising ?selling , is nt it ?every punch-line , every jingle , every smiling girl or playful baby is used to sell us a product as a mean for obtaining satisfaction and , eventually , happiness .of course advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .but is it enhancing its qualities they only thing they do ?or do they work our minds in a much more complex and wicked way ?we should nt ask ourselves if advertisments are the result of lies , because the answer is quite evident .we should ask ourselves how they affect us and how to deal with them .what publicity tries to do is not making us believe that their product is the best in the market , we can verify their promises by going to a local store .what they really try to do is to sell us values and life-styles along with the product .venezuelan beer comercials are the best example i can think of .their target is young people , so they take activities young people tipically do , like going to to beach or partying .then , they create a clever and delicate web of images , phrases and situations that work our minds into believing that consuming that beer will make us cooler , funnier and more outgoing .drinking beer makes us into everything we ve always dreamed .the sexy lady who drives boys crazy , or the stud that hooks up with ten girls on a single night .beer equals fun , like in a mathematical equation .of course , this process does nt occur at a conscient level , it s way more subtle .at the beginning we may not feel particularly atracted by the product , but after some parties where the situations showed in the ads repeat themselves contantly - marketing geniuses make sure that they do - we are unwillingly drawn to it .we start drinking , we feel confident and then we become consumers .advertisements have achived their goal .the beer story is only a small fragment of the world of comercialization in the modern world .there are ways of persuading people to consume that we ca nt even imagine .so , what should we do ?should we leave the cities and assume an amish way of living ?should we deny civilization and return to a roussaunian state of nature ?i do nt think the answer must be that radical .it all lies in our capacity of being critical , of seeing the thin threads intended to manipulate us and deciding whether to accept them or not .luckily , we are provided of freedom and capacity of choice , therefore we re not determined by the influence of publicity , no matter how hard marketing geniuses try .we must ask ourselves if we want to be comercial puppets or if we want to decide our visions of life and our social behaviour .both choices have their advantages and disadvantages , its up to us to decide who we want to be : the stud in the club or the outsider glaring full of contempt .
