many people choose to specialize in one specific subject such as biology , litrature , or business .yet , there are people who have abroad knowlegde of many acadamic fields all together .it is important for a person to expand its knowledge by studying different subjects in different fields .studying different subjects will help people understand more of what is around them .if a person studies economics for instance , he/she will understand the economy country very well .but can this person complete this subject without using math ?therefore , many programs were built to help students obtain a sense of link between subjects .an example of these programs is myp and pyp , where students are teached to creat a linkage between health and economics for example .if a person has no knowledge in other subjects he will be lost in many parts of this world .for example , if a scientist has specialized in science and only science , he would have a great knowlegde about biology and chemistry but he would be a stranger to other subjects .he would not understand politics .he would not understand the world around him and what is happening other than in his scientific point of view which has nothing to do with politics and such fields .having broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects helps in communicating with others .for instance , people from different fields can share talks among themselves .a scientist will be able to chat about litrature with a historian or an engineerer .it will be easier to make friends and chatting mates .a person with only a specialized subject will have a hard time dealing with his work .it might be hard for him to find a job or work at his job when it comes to dealing with other areas other than his field .this is why many companies and banks work on training their employees to have them learn more about different subjects .this is why i think that having a abroad knowledge is better than specializing in one area or feild .
