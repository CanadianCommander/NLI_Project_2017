young people are just beginning to live , while the elderly population have many experiences , both good and bad who have shaped the person they have become .some might say that young people enjoy life more because they can do whatever they please , they have the world at their feet .every person will eventually , become old and all they wil have left is the memory of their early days .young people might be able to do things like running , swimming , jumping faster and with more energy than the elders but there will be one time when all this energy will run out and they will become old .nothing is forever and we can not get too much of a good thing .life is short and we have to learn to to live it to its fullest always living every moment as if it were the last .both young and old people can enjoy life up to the highest level if they set their minds to it .i have recently begun to read a book called , `` tuesdays with morrie  by mitch albom and it has really changed my opinion of life .morrie is mitch s old college professor and he is dying of a rare disease .you would probably expect to see morrie in a bed , feeling sorry for himself and letting his soul fall into the shadows before it is time .many people that are sick with a disease that has no cure give up easily and they wish they were young and full of life again .we all get a chance to be young .it is up to us to take advantage of it .getting back to the book , morrie was a really exceptional person because he refused to fall into the ordinary pattern of dying before it is time .instead he tried to live what was left of this life at its fullest which , in my opinion is a really remarkable thing to do because not everyone has such amazing strength of character .how can someone know that young people enjoy life more than old people ?it is not possible to know this .nowadays , the young generation cares more about things that might seem important , such as getting a job that pays really well .we forget that the things that we might sometimes take for granted may be the most important things to us .everyone can enjoy life at every age as long as they just live it , one day at a time .older people might sometimes enjoy life more than young people because they might remember to eliminate the unimportant , materialistic aspects fo life and embrace the most important thing in every human beings life : love .
