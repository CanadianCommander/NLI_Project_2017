just like football players understand the strategies of the coach , but they do nt understand how to apply these plans they will still lose the game ; just like one may know the techniques of painting but he or she does nt know how these techiques would create a real pictures or he never saw a picture using these kinds of techniques , he still can not draw a beautiful pictures . ..as far as i concerned with the topic stated above , i wo nt agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and comcepts than it is for them to learn facts .the reasons go as follows :to begin with , as we all know the ideas and concepts are usually more abstract than the facts .it is more difficult for the students to understand at the beginning .if the students can know the facts first and then relate the facts to the theories , it is easier for them to understand deeply .it is always the case in the study fields such as economics , maths , physics .perhaps everyone may have the experience that the professors will explain the theory of movement in the physics lesson by telling the facts at the very beginning .secondly , when we think deeply , we will ask ourselves : what are the ideas and concepts serving for ?of cause it is served to apply to the daily life , or more accurate , we use it to explain the facts .so how can we know the concepts without knowing the facts ?for instance , students know the idea of the transportation of the electonic but they do nt know about the facts that this theory is applied to make the telephone , what s the purpose of knowing the theory concept .the ideas and concepts become more valuable only when they apply to our daily life and improve our life quality .last but not the least , the ideas and concepts today may not be correct just like the theory of nature seletion and evolution were not true long time ago .so the students need to know the facts and compare the facts with the idea in order to verify and make sure if it go with each other .it is also very important for a student to challenge the existing ideas using the facts they know .in a word , i think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts at the same time .
