understanding ideas and concepts are more important for some students .on the contrary , learning facts are more important for other students .that is a very complex issue because it depents on the persons .however , i agree the first statement because of some reasons .first of all , a student have to understand the ideas and concepts .after that he can learn and understand facts better .for example , when i was in the university , our teacher told us ideas and concepts .after the lesson , we learned facts by our selves .as a result of this , we could set an interaction between them easily .second , people can understand ideas and concepts more quickly .furthermore , they can get them more easily because facts can change but ideas and concepts can not change .namely , ideas and concepts are basics .for instance , while i was preparing to the toefl exam , first i studied to the concept of the exam .then i started exercising and i saw that that is better .consequently , i think understanding concepts and ideas are more important .also they are more understandable than facts .if you understand the ideas and concepts clearly , you can also get the facts easily .
