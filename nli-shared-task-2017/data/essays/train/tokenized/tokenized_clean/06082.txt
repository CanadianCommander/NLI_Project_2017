nowadays , students are leading to learn more theories , but have a lack of knowledge of the real facts .in my opinion , i do nt think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .to prove my opinion , i have three reasons .first of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flowers , trees , birds , etc. they are all the creatures , we can touch , smell , and hear .students should be taught how to admire these real things ( facts ) in our daily life , the ideas and concepts can not help students to learn more about the creatures .second of all , most of the ideas and concepts are in the book , if students are just studing theses ideas and concepts , than they will lose many chances to be in touch with nature .in contrast , nature may help children find more ideas and concepts than in the books throughout the practice in the outside .last but not the leat , the ideas and concepts are the results from the scientists or the phylogists , they may get these ideas and concepts in wrong ways .according to today s registrations , many new and correct ideas and concepts are out .but in students  books , the ideas and concepts do nt be improved , so students may get the wrong information about the facts .then , at this time , experiment is much more important , let students get correct ideas and concepts by themselves .for example , physics and chemistry can not lust learn the ideas and concepts , students must have a objective configuration of the physical and chemical facts .to sum up , the nature , the practice , and the experiment are the better means for students to get ideas and concepts of the facts .in these ways , they can not only learn the truth in the books , but also learn more about facts throuth the process of getting knowlege .
