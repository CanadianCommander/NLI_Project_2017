there are many products that seem to be too good to be true and i believe the influence of advertisements to create this image does not use the right or ethic procedure to achieve this goal .for this reason i agree with the statement presented in this question .as a tourism manager i know perfectly this situation by studing the case of touristic destinations  plans of marketing .in one hand , they usually offer an exotic and pristine place that invites you to go there and make use of this facilities : well-equipped resorts , horseback riding for lonely beaches and hiking in magical mountains , on the other hand , these plans omits crowdy beaches during high seasons , hotel rooms that do not have ocean views and so on .we could mention thousands of examples of this situation .for me this should be ruled more rigidly and lead to protect in a better way to consumers who are cheated for this advertisers .in this virtual world where information goes faster and faster by internet , the idea of advertising is becoming sample , cheap and less ruled .it is easy to see web sites showing marvelous hotels and resorts pictures and with just one click make a reservation that costs hundreds of dollars .when we get there the reality is so far away we realize that the hotel is not in the location shown or at least does not have the features presented , we understand the picture did not show how many ads and signal everywhere it was possible to see , making our enjoyable destination as polluted as a capital city and making our frustation the most unforgettable of our vacations .this is a typical case of making products seem much better than they really are .as an example let s take ocean city maryland in the united states , whoever going to the different websites offering this touristic destination can see the atlantic ocean as the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reservation and finally get there , nobody told us about the vehicular congestion , visual pollution and the noise made for teenagers running their cars overspeed .but that is , and there we are being part of a fraud as many other products that seem to be much better than they really are .
