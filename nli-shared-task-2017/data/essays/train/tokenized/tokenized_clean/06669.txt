i believe that young people enjoy life far more than old people do .this is due to three main reasons .in this essay , i will explain why i have come to this conclition .firstly , most young people have good health .as a eighteen-yearold my self , i rarely get sick or get injured compared with my neighbor lady who is seventy-five .she always tell me that health is the most important aspect , and to take care of my health since it is so important .many people in japanese society believe this idea .also , there is a word in japanese that saids : the inner health comes from the outer health .this means that if an individual is physicaly healthy , he/she will be mentaly health , refering to having positive emotions .which indicates that people can enjoy their lifes when they are healthy .secondly , having both old and new ways of thinking is easy for young people .young people can learn new ideas or analise new techniques .they are able to use technology , and conseme new ideas .in addition , young people can learn history at school , or listen to stories from older people , such as parents , grand-parents , and neighbors .having a diverse thinking will allow a prosperous life , which can mean a enjoyable life .on the other hand , older people are not advanced in handleing new ideas , on new techniques .forexample , my mother who is fifty-years-old , can not handle advanced technology such as her mobile-phone .thirdly , young people are usualy ambisious then older people .this is because young have not seen the big world yet , which allows them tohave diverse goals .also , young people can study hard to get in a good university , to enjoy life .however , most older people have brain which can not consume many materials physicaly .also , older peoplr know the limit of goals and dreams .i believe that having a goal or a dream increases the standards of living .which leads to an enjoyable life .
