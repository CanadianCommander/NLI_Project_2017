some people these days , might want to travel in a quite place or by one s self .for instance , there are some people around us who do nt like to be in a group and meet people .i support the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .it would make people s travel more interesting .for example , lot of information are givin by the guide , saving time and more opportunites to travel much more places .these days , traveling does nt just mean playing .people also treat traveling as one of the education that students should definitely need .we could hear lot of imformation from the guide .there are lot of guides who are really intellegint these days .as we can get information while we re traveling , it will allow me to be more thoughtful stdent and knowlegeable person .most importanly , people who are traveling can save lot of time than who are traveling by one s self .the reason wht is that almost all of guides planned exact schedules which lead travelers to have much more thighten time .for me , i wouldnt wate time by traveling .another reason is that we could have much more opportunities to to travel lot of places .most of travelers might think they want to travel and visit lot of places as possible as they could .for example , travelers would not want to travel fewer places than the other travelers who paid same amount of money .thus , these are the reasons why i would prefer to travel in a group led by tour guide rather than just travel by myself .led by a tour guide , travelers could have more information about the places , saving time by guide s plan and we could afford more opportunities to travel more places as possible .so i belive it will be more interesting for people to travel .
