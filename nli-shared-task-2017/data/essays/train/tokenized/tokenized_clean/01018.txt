some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .however , others disagree .in my opinion , i think the former statemment is true .this is because young people are energetic , brave , and chanllengable .young people always have energy to do many things .for example , they will use their free time to hang out with their friends .they will go to some places to enjoy themsleves as clubs , bars , and movie centers .furthermore , young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than stay at home .they are afraid of grounding because it is indispensible for them to have fun .in addition to being engergetic , people who are young have bold to enjoy their life .for instance , they try to do things which older people afraid to do .like ferry wheels .one can conceive a 80-year-old man sitting on the ferry wheels will almost kill him , but not a young person .they are always being curious about new things .moreover , they will not bother how much money have they left .instead , they will have a great time to spend the money to find their dream beautiful life .finally , young people can endure the chanllenges .a example is , they will chanllenge new stuff to know the right way to enjoy life even including doing drugs .on the other hand , older people prefer a peaceful life .it is clear that i agree with the statement because young people have energetic spirits both pysically and mentally .therefore , they will not feel tired by having fun in their lives .also , they are never afriad to pursuid their happiness in their lives .lastly , they are the people who can be chanllenged to enjoy life .for the previous reasons , i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
