why does a person acquire knowledge ?i would say , so that it can be used in living a better life , and if possible making that possible for others as well .which , then takes us to the question of which is better , a generalistic or specific .i think the answer is , a mix of both .it is really very difficult not to grow up acquiring a broad knowledge or understanding of various academic disciplines as we move up through school and college .we do end up studying different subjects and that is good as it makes us aware of a whole lot of basic information etc. about so many fields of study that have close bearings on our lives .it is also this stage that prepares us towards understanding what these various subjects deal with and consequently which we find ourselves interested in .so , some amount of broad broad knowledge is generally built in to our academics .however , specialisation in a particular subject also invariably happens at a later stage in college or university .i think that in the world we are living in , it is more and more becoming essential to specialise in a subject so that you have market for your skills in the job market .with the current levels of specialisation that the advances in science and technology has brought about in our work lives , it is nearly impossible to be very good at two things .not only have you to chose early in life whether you want to study medicine , enginering or music but you have to decide soon enough in your chosen stream what specialisations you are interested in .if we take the example of the field of midicine , till two or three decades back , majority of the doctors start practicing as a generalist after an mbbs degree .the ones who did go for a specialisation would generally chose from being a physician or a surgeon or gynaecologist and less then a dozen other specialistions .but todays world of medicine has more than a dozen specialistions each for phisicians and surgeons .to conclude , i would say that the world today belongs majorly to a specialist and hence the importance of specialising and in fact super specialising in a subject .we however , should also realise the importance of having people with broad knowldege of things amonst us to fill in key places .
