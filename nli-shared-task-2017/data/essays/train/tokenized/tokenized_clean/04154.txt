do you agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?most people may diagree that because they think people will rely on cars more in the future than today .however , i agree with the statement because i think the technology will create new transpotation tool to replace the car .i will argue over my perspectives with the following reasons .first of all , accoring to the insufficient of the petroleum , scitients are eager to device new tools to replace the cars .nowadays the oil resources become a searious problem all over the world .since the resource are limited , humans can not use it without restriction .however , people are too late to get aware of that , so the price of oil starting soaring up and it might cause the third world war .in order to avoid the energy problem become the trigger of the war , every countries will decrease the use of cars .secondly , people in the future will develope a more efficent and rapid transportation tool which can replace cars .although it only happens in the movie now , the future people will fly in the sky , i still believe it can come true under the scientists endeavor .people become more and more lazy and the ground get crowder than before , without any space to extend , it seems to reansonable to enlarge people s living to the sky .in addition , fly can save more time and also solve traffic problems happens now .however , this need the technology to reach the goal and i expect that .to sum up , although cars are main tool that people depend on , with the overuse of cars , there are a lot of peoblems emerging .in order to release ourselves from vicious circle , human beings will initiate one new thing to help us attain the same goal .in other words , people is going to invent air-transpoted tools to declin the number of cars .
