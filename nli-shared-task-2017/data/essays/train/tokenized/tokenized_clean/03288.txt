some people said young people nowadays does nt help our cominities .i supose that is true , but there are some reasons why young people does nt help the comunities .i think young people nowadays are very busy .they have a lot of things even if they do nt help their communities .they have to go to the piano lessons or go to swimming , or do something .other children must study hard from early morning to midnight , because their parents wants them go to good univercity .the other children have to help their housework .young people nawadays often go to learn something even if holiday .for example , piano , swimming , dancing and so on .therefore they do nt have time to help their comminities .even though children want to help and join them , they have already many things to do .most children study very hard , because their parents wants them to that .sometimes they may study from early mornig to late evening , or they study even it is on the holiday .if there are the day children do nt have to study hard , they want to be relaxed at home , or play with their friends .therefore , they do nt have enough time to help their communities .these days , many parents work outsides thier house , so they need thier son or doughter s help , so children have to thier housework to help thier parents .there are many housework .for instance , clean their family s rooms , make the dinner , wash the dishes , wash their cloths , and so on .therefore if they have to do them , they are tired and they have no time to help their communities .nowadays young people have a lot of things to do , i think , so they ca nt help their communities , even if they want to help them .
