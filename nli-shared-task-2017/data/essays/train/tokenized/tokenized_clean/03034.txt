i totaly agree with the statment that successful people try new things and take risk rather than doing the monotonus work , which he knows how to perform well .a successfull person always shows detremination , try to act differently , exploring new idea & ready to take challenge .successful person knows ho get new achievment , he must have to perform differently , skillfully on different things than a normal person to get success in his life .he always in search new idea & try to implement it .for example , edision , he discoverd the bulb after faced so many failure .but he never loose his hope and try to learn from his mistake and this approach make him a successfull person .moreover , a successfull person is determined what he has to do & try it untill he get the success .he knows his path is fill with lot of difficulties but he also knows that after success , he get lot of admiration & praise , which is more valuable then the difficult he face during the work to achieve the success .for example , tanmaya , one our technical head , he started his career as a apprentice but today he bacome the head of technical team , just a span of 3 year .the only thing , which help him to achieve this success is his determination and ready to take any challenge .i realy admire him for his stun performance .according to me , he is a successfull person in his life .in sum , a person is successfull if he ready to do something new , take any challenge/risk , determine & skillfull .this above mention qualities make a person to able to handle any situation adroitly in his life ( social life & professional life ) .
