centuries ago , a writer could also be a doctor , a scientist and an economist .people used to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs as it is illustrated in the book gargantua by rabelais .nowadays , people become more and more specialized .let s face it , our knowledge is so huge in every academic subjetc that it is impossible to know everything in every topic .there is a common joke in economics thats points out that every economist gets specialized in a very specific topic and does not know anything about the rest .it is a consequence of the specialization of people that took place in the nineteenth century .indeed , progress has been made in many areas and the knowledge has increased .in this respect , medecine is a case in point , people used to know very little about the organistation of the human body but nowadays , the knowledge is so broad that doctors have to get specialized to be efficient .furthermore , the only doctors who remain generalists ca nt cure everything and they often send you to a specialist to resolve your problem .however , a bad consequence of this specialization is that people do nt know any more everything about their own subject .if you have a broken leg , a neurologist wo nt be able to do anything to help you .but anyway , according to me , this evolution towards specialisation is useful and , moreover , ineluctable .it is first ineluctable because as i have said the knowledge is now so broad that a human being ca nt know everything .furthermore , it is useful because it allows us to better understand a very specific point of our subjetc .for instance , all the progresses that have been made in the research for the cancer would not have been possible without this specialization .to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs is pleasant but it also means that this knowledge will remain limited and it s why specialization is needed .
