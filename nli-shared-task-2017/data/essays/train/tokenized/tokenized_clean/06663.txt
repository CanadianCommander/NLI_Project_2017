advertisements are born to sell a product and , in order to this , to invite people to buy something .of couse they need to be actractive for the public and obviously they look better than they are .personally , i will never spend my money for a good that is represented in a way i do nt like , for example if it does nt seem beautiful to my eyes .particularly , if there are more types of the same product , i m going to prefer the one that in the advertisment looks better , even if i know it lacks in quality .the most significant thing for a lot of people is only appearance .another important aspect of advertisments is that they have to catch the attension of an as great as possible number of people , in the middle of thousands of similar advertisments .moreover , the greatest part of people does nt have or , better , does nt want to waste his time in controlling the real usefullness of a product and so they have to trust in what advertisment tells .so it s obvious advertisments make poducts seem better than they realy are , it s their `` job  . although this , advertisments have nt the right to do disinformation about a good .they ca nt deforme the reality beyond a certain line , because this could be dangerous even for the advertise itself .as said before , people have to trust in advertisments , but if this fail this aim more than one time , people will change kind of product , choosing to listento another advertisements .it s a matter of trust , but above all it s a matter of money .even if it s not very correct to behave like this , it s natural in a world of buisness .
