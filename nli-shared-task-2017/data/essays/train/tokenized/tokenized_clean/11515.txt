the car is the main transport vehicel in the modern times .nearly every houshold in germany has one or even two cars .with this sentence i point out that i do not agree with the statement given .from the time cars were invented until now their is a high rise in the manufaturing of cars .because of mass production of cars , they are availible to more people now , than it used to be in the past .since peple want to save more time , cars are very important to travel .people do not have to wait until buses or trains arrive .they are more flexible in their time schedule .as an example i can say that i like to get up very late in the morning to leave my house for an appointment .in this moment i have to calculate time for the bus .the bus does not run every minute , i have to go to the bus stop and this costs me time which i could spend in bed .it is much more relaxing for me to go by car , because i know were i parked it and i do not have to hurry to be in time at the bus stop .but another important point is that buses or trains are often too late .i would not be at my appointment in time .if i go somewhere with my car i can choose who i will sit in with .buses and trains are public transport vehicals .i have to coupe with all of the people joining the bus/train .in winter it is a bad situation .because it is could people wear a lot of cloths and when they come in the bus they may start to sweat .if there are a lot of people it can happen that there is a bad air and this does not let me feel confortable .these are only two reasons why i do not belive in reducing cars appearance in twenty years and it is only my point of view .but i can image if there would be a public questioning about this most of the people would point out this reasons why in twenty years there will be the same or even more cars than today .
