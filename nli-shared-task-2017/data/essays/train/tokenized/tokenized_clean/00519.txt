when i was a student in high school in my country , south korea which country has a lot of test in school system , i studied hard to get a good grade on my test in a short time .so , i had tutor to help my study .the tutorial was a professional to lead her student to study efficiently .her teaching way was to give an ideas and key concepts to her student .first of the half week , i was the way far from the class that i was nt sure about what points she wants to point out .however , after few lectures with her , i really grasp the main point that contains the fact that we try to reach .with my great experience , i agree with the opinion that understaning ideas and concepts is more important than leaning facts for the three facts .first of all , the facts that we learn is usually has the some `` reasons  why that facts occured .the `` reasons  is an ideas and comcepts .to recall of my school days , my professor was always teaching the student about the main key ideas to approach to the main problems , the facts .this approaching way to the fact was really helpful to think up the multi other facts .second of all , when we read a textbook , you will soon find out that it says a lot of the concepts of the facts .this fact shows me that the author of that textbook pocus on the concepts rather than just pointing out the facts .as we generally know , the textbook authors always try to help readers understanding .and the authors way to writing textbook is shows as many information that could give the ideas and concepts .third of all , in the real lecture test , the professor do not only ask about facts .professors usually ask about how the facts happened , or presented .it means that many of professors believe that studying and understand ideas and concepts rather than study only fact is more effective to learn .in conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
