this philosophic question , to know who is enjoying the more life between young and old people , is a current one .an often answer is that olders have more experiments , and had to solve more problems , to reconize each new hapiness moment and enjoy it as it should .but , i do nt think so , because to my mind it s only a way to not be threaten by our futur .in my opinion , young people are quite naiv and not realy aware of their environnement .for them everyday is a new one , they are nt boried accumulating problems , their owne are essentialy about their boy or girlfriends . ..moreover i think that a lot of olders , like my grand-grand-mother , was realy traumatished by the second world war .and , even if they did nt done it , their children to .because , in many family this feeling of constent threat and fear from the human genre was quickly transmited from parents to children .but , nowadays , we could see that all over the world , youngs try to make extrem actions , like being violent , practicing extrem sports , preapering atemotats , drinkng alcool and in many other ways . ..so can we say that yongs are happy and enjoy life ?i realy do nt know .my final opinion would be that not more than the older . ..
