i mainly agree with the statement .advertisements are presented in such a professional way that they are able to make costumers believe they need excactly the product which is shown .advertisement is made to show you everything the product can do or how it changes your daily life in a very positive manner .there is never shown a negative aspect .the key is , that advertisement is mostly placed at television in the late evening when the people are watching a show or a film and do not want to think about what they look at .so they do not think about all the negative aspects the product may have , they listen to the music , which is of course perfectly chosen , they see images of great landscapes or happy families so that they are in a very positive mood .and that is just what the company wants their consumers to be in , a positive mood , where you are more likely to buy products of every kind , even if you do not need them at all .furthermore , they are tested with a small audience before they are released so that the company who invented the advertisement can change some kind of it if the test audience critizes it a lot , so there is an improved kind of quality controll .another aspect is , that the firm who produces the food or whatever has to be advertised , does not create the advertisement itself in most cases .they engage a company which is a speciallist in advertisements and so they know everything about what their consumers want to see .at the end it is important that the statemant includes not every advertisement ever made .there are big exceptions from that rule , for example when you see a saucege crashing into a wall it does not animate me to buy a safe car .and you must allways remember that they only create an illusion , when you buy the product just because of its advertisement without comparing it depending on real facts with other products , you will not have much fun with your new product .in conclusion , i have to admit that advertisements are influencing everybody s shopping behaviour a lot because they are able to present the product in a nearly perfect way .
