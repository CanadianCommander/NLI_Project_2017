i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .many youngsters today volunteeer at hospitals , old age homes , or participate in animal care centers and nature clubs .young people surely care enough about the community to help out , for the simple reason that they also belong to this community and are proud of it .many people have a general impression that young people just do nt care about their community especially in the present day .on the contrary , many young people are aware of the various problems faced by the community .there are a variety of ares where you find the young taking part .many students help out in hospitals where they are required to do simple things but which make a world of difference to the patients .it shows them that some one cares .students join nature clubs or animal protection clubs .such groups always conduct activities which benifit the community in some form or other llike building trees or caring for injured or homeless animals .the young also join communities which help take care of orphanages .a lot of youngsters visit old age homes and spend time with the foks there .sometimes rallies are held for the betterment of a certain cause in the society .this could also be thought of as a form of helping out the community .most young peole do care about their community and help out whenever they have spare time .this is because they are introduced to the problems faced by the community early in their life .in the present day , the young have a lot more responsibilities to give back to the community .it is very important for young people to think about the community and come up with solutions to help the problems faced by the community .the young will always help out in the problems faced by the community as they are the future of that community .
