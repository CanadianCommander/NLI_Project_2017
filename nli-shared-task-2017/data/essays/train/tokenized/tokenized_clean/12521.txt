i agree with this sttement .most advertisements on magazines and tv are really atractive .every time i see them , they say to me  i am tasty  or  you will look better if you wear this  .it is dificult for me to stop buy them .for example , when i bouhgt a food which i had seen an advertisement on tv or magazines before , i usually think  this is different from an advertisement .they did not say tyuth !a real food is usually smaller .also the taste of it is not good .many cookies in advertizement are made fresh and savory and crispy .not only foods but also cloths , i offten disappoint the real cloths at a department store .when i try them and look at a millar , i think `` this is not one which i saw on the magazine !it is true that every cloths looks very fine and gramarous when super models wear them .and such a advertisements makes me think that i looks thin and have faburous style if i will wear them .some electlicity such as tvs and personal computers and cell phones in advertizements are different too .many of them are complicate and diffifult to use actually .but an older man in tv advertizement uses a cell phone without memo or a woman uses microwave with only an index finger .after she prssing a bottun , she do only waiting .it is very useful and helpful .
