it is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subjects to success .however , contrary to this opinion , i strongly believes that people who live modern times should have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects .the reason behind this is that the period when we are living now needs someone who have a variety of knowlege .moreover , if someone focus only one specipic subject , he or she might be biased without balace .first of all , i strongly believe that people who are living this period should have wide knowledge of many acadcemic subject .the reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others .when it comes to biotechnology , people are eazy to think that it has no relationshio with philosophy at all .however , when i wached the some sf movie , ` island  , i deeply concerned about the technology to make new lives , so called gernorm project , is reasonable and ethnical .it is a problem of philosopy .this example shows that these two academic subjects are very imtimate each other .secondly , if someone commited only on only one specific subject , he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balancing .this is because i believe that academic areas originated from one subject , which was not divided like now .as society began to divided and specialized , the academic subjects began to separated too .however , nowadays , there are new tries to combine the separated acacemic areas for more academic progress .for ecxample , to cure patients , doctors are working with sociologist because the reason that patients suffer from disease come from not only health illorder , but also social problem such as too much stress and envirionmental pullution .in sum , without any hesitation , i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subjects that to specialize in one sucject , all in all , academis in one .
