from every travel , what we get at the end are just a group of memories .events , things learned , people met , and lots of specific information that may be with us until we leave this world .a tour guide is an effective and excellent way to ensure a quality trip , and what better than a great trip with friends and family !my family is a huge fan of tour guides and is obsessed with traveling always together .`` we all go , or nobody goes  my mom usually says when somebody is planning a trip on his own .they always say that the trip is not even worthwhile without the two key ingredients : a good group and a good guide .i sometimes wonder myself if they would rather leave me and take a guide to all of the trips we have made in our lifetime .i have to say , regardless of the weird obsession my parents have for guides , i agree with them .having a guide helps you understand the history and the people of the place you are visiting .you can get recommendations for good places to eat , fun parks to visit , and interesting museums and shows .and best of all , share all this with the company you have !on a trip i made to europe two years ago ( obviously with every member of my family ) , i went to see a city that hundreds of years ago had been covered in lava , and completely destroyed .the first thing my father did when we arrived at thhis amazing place , was to look for the best guide he could find .i think regular parents first take a look at the place , read something about them , and probably go buy the tickets to enter ; but not my dad .in less than five minutes he came with a spanish guide that had studied history in a prestigious university , and spoke around six languages .although i make fun of my parents  obsession , i have to say that in every trip we make we have the best tour guides a tourist can possibly get .i should probably thank them for getting the best out of every place we visit , because that is really priceless .in conclusion , i would like to say that groups and guides are an incredible combination for every trip .it gives you people to talk and have fun with , and the touch of history and education we should all receive .
