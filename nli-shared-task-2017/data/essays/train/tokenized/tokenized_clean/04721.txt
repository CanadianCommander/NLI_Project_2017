i agree with this opinion .i have two reasons for this .at first , we will be able to think about a thing with broad value if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i think that a person who specialize in one specific subject is apt to think about a thing with one value .for example , we have to use knowledge of develoment economics and environment economics at least when we think about how to improve the problems of developing countries .we can not think about how to solve it if we only use one subject .at second , we need broad value and broad knowledge in this time .that is because the world is getting international more and more .we have to think about a thing at any sight .for example , it is about problems of war .a war is difficult problem to improve .so we have to approach it with broad knowledge .we have to consider economical , financial and philosofical problems of it .there are so many things in the world that we can not think and solve them without broad knowledge .for this two reasons , i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .it is sure that the world has many complex problems .and it is also sure that these problems can not solve without broad knowledge .so i assure you that we must have broad knowledge and broad view in whole of our lives .
