there are different types of people in our society and every individual has his or her own ideals .while some of these people prefer to continue the way the situatuion they re in , some always try to do new things and to improve themselves .in my opinion , first of all , one has to improve himself every passing second .you should never stop at a point and say ` well , that s enough for me  .in order to do this , though , one should always try new things , otherwise there would nt be any develeopment .at this point it should be considered that there might exist some risks at new things .new tries could lead one not only to success , but also they could lead one to failure which would be an unpleasent eperience for everyone .in order to give an appropriate example to the subject , i should mention about my fahter who has come to germany as a worker and worked for many years as a humble worker .by the time he has been working in germany he received a salary which was not that immense .but he than saved his money to make a capital form his earnings and to try some new bussiness with his savings .he got involved to estate bussiness and succeeded .but there was this big risk that could have lost all his saving by investing it in an inappropriate bussines .if he would nt took this risk , though , and kept working at a factory for a low salary , he would nt have been able to be in the situation currently he is in .but this does nt mean that one shoud always risk to be succesful .one could be succesful in other ways as well .some charachteristics of an individual such as ambition , hard and steady working never givin up , could also enable the person to achieve his or her aim .though i think that it would worth to take risks in order to achive important goals .therefore i agree withe the statement that one should take risks to be successful .
