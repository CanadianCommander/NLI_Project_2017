although a good basic and broad academic background is essential for any student in order to develop an understanding about his world and culture , gaining some specific experience and knowledge is the only way to make a student distinguish from others .based on the hard experience i am facing now while trying to find a job after completing my degree , i support the idea of speacializing and becoming unique .during the last years , the number of students who after school enters an university in my country has amazingly increased .speaking about school education , i could choose among different fields of study .i focused on a more cientific and tecnological one , what helped me to pass the access exam i needed in order to get the computer science degree i am holding now .once at the university , the firts courses should be mainly oriented in offering more general and broad subjects .in such a way , the students will have enough information to choose their major or future professional orientation .but as the education advances , the content of the subjects should be divided into specific branches .by electing specific subjects and labs , i got valuable knowledge and training that makes a difference between my colleagues when the time to get a job has come .having more specialized employees also benefits companies .it reduces competence and companies spend less money in the selection process .employees do not suffer so much during the hard interviews and feel more comfortable and sure about what the company expects from them .as an example , i only send my resume to those companies whose job offers fit me .both the company and i are saving time and money .to recap , specializing students and making them valuable for specific tasks , should help them in the future to find a position in a company where they will feel usefull and suitable .
