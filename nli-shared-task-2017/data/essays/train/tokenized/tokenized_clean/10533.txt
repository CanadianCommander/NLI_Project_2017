during our last few school years , we are faced with choosing subjects which we would like to specialise in , in the future .some students choose a small number , while others take almost as many as possible .the student with the more subjects will be more skilled than the other , and will have better career opportunities later on .when one specialises in one specific subject , he or she can excel at it perfectly .this can benefit us in many ways .for example , if a person is so good at something , he or she will be so skilled , and will be able to perform the task successfully and efficiently , saving time and energy .on the other hand , when specialising in only one particular subject , we are limiting ourselves and are unable to reach our full potential .having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is more useful than excelling in just one , as not only does it give you more skills , it also increases your chance of success in the future .think about it logically ; would you rather employ someone who can only perform one task , than employ someone who can perform dozens ?i would choose the latter .studying a variation of subjects also keeps us more fulfilled , and less bored .if you studied the same subject over and over again , for a vast period of time , you would get extremely weary of the subject , and therefore would make it seem very uninteresting .you are given so many opportunities in this life , so what is the point of wasting them .you must always strive for the best and want to learn more .why limit yourself to just one thing ?although sometimes it is useful to excel at something , i disagree with the statement ` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
