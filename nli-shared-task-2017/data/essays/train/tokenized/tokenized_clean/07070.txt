learning a wide knowlede of academic subjects is strongly important to nourish a person in univerisity .although there are various methods of gaining educational programs through life , the university is necessary as the place for the pre-step to work in society .let me explain these reasons as follows .my primary reason is that a broad knowledge could stimulate students  interests or help students find their interests .when i enrolled to tokyo university , i was thinking about majoring in civil engineering .however , though many academic classes in first two years in the university , my interests expanded into a wider academic world .although i majored in civil engineering , i could solve problems according to buiding structure or environment engineering with various aspects of thoughts such as economics or chemical science , owing to a boad knowledge .next , various skills will be required in workplace .even one project of a constructing building need many knowledge and skills .to research the site to build precisely , scientific knowledge is important .skill to make blue prints for it is also inevitable , in addition to the basic technique of using personal conputers .in order to exoplain this building plan to other people and share this concept , limitted knowlede and skills are impossible to work better with others .if a students hope to concentrate on the specialized subject , he or she could enter the graduate program .in the graduate , students can pursue own interests more deeply and take a step to ahieve a career goal .however , the young has great potential which an individual never find it by themselves .then , absorving the knowledge in the unknown world could play an important role through life .i believe that unknown subjects of many academic subjects could expand students  interests and ability in university .provided skills and knowlede in academic institutions also are required in the workplace someday .it is important the young to gain a wide variety exoerience though many subjects so as to solve many probelms and deepen own interests for good .
