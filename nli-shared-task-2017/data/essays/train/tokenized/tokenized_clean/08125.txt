in newspapers we oftenly read that today s youth would be the so-called ` fun generation  who is ignoring the problems and needs of their community .in my opinion , that s a generalisation which does nt fit with reality .young people can and are engaged in a wide range of fields .in germany , there is for example the ` volunteer social year  that young people can choose to do after they finished high-school and before they start higher education .in this framework , young men and women are caring for a period of twelve months either for elder or disabled people or are engaged in cultural or political organisations .further , it has become relatively frequent that german high-school absolvents go to another country or continent to do some social work .in 2005 i attended a world youth congress in scotland that gathered active young people from all around the world who are involved in developing projects within their communities .there were lots of examples of young people who are doing fantastic work . .a young indian girl who creates a library for girls or a sierra leonean who conducts workshops for a reintegration of former child soldiers to civil life are just two of them .i think that today s young generation is combining the principle of fun and care for their community because they discover that it gives pleasure to help .they have the educational background and the necessary awareness to be able to recognize how their own behaviour affects the development of their community - at least they should have it .but in the case that this consciousnes is not yet existing , there are other young people lobbzing for it .an example are the karlsruhe student days one world where high-school students get familiar with topics around globalisation , environmental protection and human rights by attending workshops which are conducted by members of active youth groups .
