i agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i base my opinion on substantial points favoring the consumers than the business .one of the important things observed in advertisements these days is that they fail to portray the complete informaiton .let us take an example of `` x hair dye  .the advertisement for this says that `` you can get a better hair texture , brighter color and stronger hair if you use x hair dye .some person develops an allergy with the hair dye and builds skin rashes .it was not the problem with the person but the incomplete information provided to the consumer .the consumer is entailed to read and verify all the information stated in the package and then could have possibly deciphered its allergy .most of the cases , we as consumers , come to know the complete fact only when we buy the product and read the details .i believe that giving incomplete information is a means of luring the consumer into buying the product .various products are available in the market and lot of them compete with each other in the same space .advertisements play a significant role of manipulating the fact to overpower its competitor .let us take an example of an auto insurance advertisement-geico for instance .geico in the north eastern part of united states advertises that it provides the lowest auto insurance rates .any consumer gets easily lured to geico s website or customer service to check if he/she can actually lower the rate .on careful analysis it is observed that some other auto insurance firms prove to be cheaper than geico , for example liberty mutual .geico provides low insurance rates to consumers who have a good credit history and fantastic driving records .this factor is common for all auto insurance companies .if only , geico would have advertised `` we sell cheap auto insurances to people with good credit history and great driving record  !thus advertisements manipulate the fact and do not present a true picture .under most of the circumstances , cost is major factor for consumers .advertisements do a fantastic job in not revealing the hidden costs .for example , a consumer gets lured to buy a washing machine and reaches the store .he has almost narrowed down his search and starts talking to the sales representative .cost has been a major factor in his decision .once he starts talking to the sales representative , he understands that the washing machine requires other components without which it can not operate .these other components increase the cost of the washing machine .if the advertisers would have portrayed the need to buy other components , the consumer would not have wasted his time in buying that machine or would have waited for some more time until he had that money .to conclude , i believe that advertisers do an amazing job in luring the customers .most of the time the advertisers do ensure that the consumer is not duped and has access to all the informaiton required to buy or use the product .but in all these cases , a decent amount of time and energy needs to be invested by the consumers to decipher if the product actually suits their needs .
