actually i do agree with the statment , i mean it s pretty true if we read some articles or if we wach the news on tv or just if we are a little bit involved with the communities .i think that young people as me ( i m 23 yeras old and so i m putting myself in the examples ) really do nt help their communities but i wanna figure out what are the reasons of this behaviour .i do nt want to defend or go against my categories but i would like to consider the motivations : first of all i think that nowadays we actually do nt have enough time also for other things , i m referring at the family s problems or just family s life .probably with the school or university , with the exams , with the homework and with others millions of activities outside the school we want do or in which we want to join ( or our parents want we do ) our young people have to organize our day as better as possible .sometimes i have the impression that 24 hours a day are not enough to do all even if you are a really organized person ( lessons in the morning , study in the afternoon , extra class in the evening , gym after class ...new meeting with the new school or the new organization or . .. )you can see that is gonna be so hard to find time for something else .on the other hand i think that if you want to find time for something you really care you are able to do that !i mean if you have a new boyfriend ( in my case )i m sure i will take some free time to stay with !probably the problem is not find the time to help your communites but just think about this opportunity , it will be a great advantage for everybody also for yourself .helping people that really need your hand i think it s one of the most important and satisfed experiences in your life .in conclusion there is not a good responce to this statment , it s just up to you .it depend on your priority in life .in my personal opinion find more time to help people makes sense above all because you are helping somebody or you are doing something really precious for other people and also for the improvment of your personal life !
