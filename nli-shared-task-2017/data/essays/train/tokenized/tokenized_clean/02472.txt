how to be successful ?is it rather by only repeating thing that you already know how to do well or rather by trying new things ?on the one hand , i think that to succeed in anything , everyone has to practise .for instance , a tennis player , before winning competitions , has to practise for hours and even days .when you repeat something , it becomes easier to complete and you will even be able to do it faster and more accurately .the first time you try something , you will most likely fail .then , with the habit of doing it , you will improve yourself .consequently , successful people may be successful because they have practised enough and now know how to do well .but on the other hand , with only repeating the same acts , maybe you will stop thinking .you will begin to act mechanically , therefore you wo nt have the will to improve yourself .so i am strongly convinced that trying new thing is also very important : you have to learn not to be afraid of what you have never met before .for instance , i have studied mathematics and i was told by my teachers to practise with long and complex problems , that i had never seen before , rather than with small and repetitive exercises , with a view to learning how to deal with new questions .moreover , if at some moments of your life you do nt take risks , if you do nt put yourself in danger , if you always want to be secure , you may lose many opportunities : for instance , if you want to get a better job for which you are not quite prepared , you must be courageous and not be afraid to apply for it , to tru everything to get it .to conclude , the solution of this concern is far from easy .what would be the best behavior ?to my mind , both are relevant , but at different moments .you should nt hesitate to try new things , even if you feel unprepared , but to succeed in new things you must always keep in mind everything that you already know : what you know how to do well can prove very useful to do new things .
