did you ever think how successful people become successful ?the answer of this question is most probably : by trying new things and taking risks rather than doing something already known .trying new things is one of the ways of being successful .one of the important characteristics that makes a person successful is being different .people usually do not clap something they see everyday .why people like magicians ?because they are doing something that we can not understand how he is doing it and that can not be seen in everyday life .the same thing can be applied to subject of success .of course this does not mean you are unsuccessfull with an university grade 3.5 over 4 because there are a lot of 3.5s , but any way a person with a university degree of 4 is more successful than you , since there are less 4s .another way of being successful is taking risks .you can not know what you are doing is good or bad unless you see its result .in order to see the result , you should do that thing and in order to do it ; you should take risks .this is like a chain .none without one .think of climbers .when we see them at the top of the mountains with a great smile on their faces , we understand the happiness of success , but how does a climber do this ?by taking several risks .he may fall because the rock he hold cracked .this does not mean that every risk can be or should be taken .risk is something external .if climber falls because he hold the wrong rock , this is not a result of risk ; because this is his fault ; he is not trained enough to climb that rock .this is something internal .in conclusion , trying new things and taking risks bring success , but knowing what is risk is an important point to be considered .
