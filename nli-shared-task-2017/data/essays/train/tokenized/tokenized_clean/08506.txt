i agree with that the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  for reasons .the first reason is because most of many companies are tring to make a good advertisements to sell most of their products , and that means they have to give a good offers for their products , so they show some views and how their products are more benefical than others .for example , if there is a advertisements about a company and it offers have cheaper payment than others and thier offers include a big size on the advertisements on the contrast of the fact , most of the people would start buying their products , so because of this way they gain alot of costomers .the second reason is that because most of people have unsatisfy reputation about their products so it is logicaly to give a good reputation by advertisements .for example , if a big percent of people have gotten a bad reputation because of a mistake that has done by one of their emplyee in the past , their employees woud try to change this bad reputation by a good servies and an advertisements which change this bad reputation .
