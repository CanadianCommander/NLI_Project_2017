if i was asked some details on the exam , i wrote last week , i probably could nt remember a lot , although i spend quite an amount of time on preparation .is nt that a hint for the necessarity of changing learning requirements and student education - in my opinion , the teaching of basic qualifications concerning the achievement and comprehension of knowledge and thinking is the more effective way to a fluent , highly adaptable intellectual ability .being able to understand ideas and concepts is a capability which is required in nearly any kind of intellectual situation .to be capable of the most important tools in dealing with academic material which maybe catching the main idea of a text , summarizing basic points , understanding the intention of an author or speaker , etc. is the basis for any kind of apprenticeship .unfortunately , this qualifications play a subordinate role compared to the learning of facts .of course , facts are also of importance to be able to treat a certain topic , but without the ability to integrate single facts into one s fluent knowledge , they wo nt last in mind for long time .being able to use the basic tools for dealing with any kind of knowledge presented will strongly improve the ability to find out important facts if needed .like one of my teachers told me `` you do nt need to keep any fact in mind , but you need to know where to find it if necessary  , it is important to konow about sources and connections between them - which means their basic ideas - while dealing with any context of apprenticeship .as described above , i think , students should get familiar to understanding ideas and concepts , and even to develope their own ones , because this will allow them to deal with unknown information und contexts .as especially at an early age , the human brain is able to develope , it is very important to implement basic competencies of learning and thinking at that time .the facts will be learned , when the basic concepts are clear .
