i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .this is seriously observed in urbanised communities than in rural comunities .the possible reason why young people nowadays spend less time in helping their communites could be their tight and hectic schedules .the education system these days is really challenging the students .it is not that easy to get through such a process of education because of the severe competition among the young students .the students can not afford to leave the education system responsibilites for the sake of community requirements .if they dont concentrate much on their education they will have to regret at the poor grades they score and the poor performance they had given .this would affect their future .they would nt get enough or suitable employment opportunites .usually , a student with good educational qualifications get enough opportunities to lead their professional life satisfactorily .the other possible reason could be the change of mindset of the students these days .the present day students lack the quality of helping nature .this could have been resulted from the severe competition from their counterparts .so , students have turned selfish .they dont show concern for the development of the fellow-student because of the fear that they might overtake .for example , in a university there are limited number of seats .obviously all those who are aware of the fact keep it confidantial and do not show concern for others because of the fear that the university seats get exhausted .a similar kind of attitude is more seriously observed among the employees of a company .an employee is reluctant towards his co-employee or he doe nt show any concern to help him because of the fear that the opther person might overtake .the reason for this kind of behaviour among the people is the lack of enough number of opportunities .so , for all these reasons , the pesent day students neither concentrate much on community affairs nor contribute for the community welfare .
