i do not agree with the statement that the number of cars will be smaller in number in near future than they are today .it is evident that the traffic within the city center is getting worse each day and the public transportation is gaining increasing importance .especially around big cities , like istanbul which i am living in , it is true that people are increasingly avoiding car usage due to the above mentioned reasons and have the tendency to use public transportation or taxi etc. instead , which might lead one to think that the number of cars will decrease in time .however ; there are other dimensions of the subject .first of all , even if some people are becoming increasingly reluctant to use their cars in city , most of them still feel it necessary to have one .the reasons vary .one could be privacy , which you can not have with public transport .the other could be availability ; all of us have experienced not being able to find a taxi when you have an important appointment .your car is always at your service and is actually a medium for independence .besides , the increased number of suburban living areas makes the people living there almost totally dependent on cars as public transportation is wider and more frequent around city centers .finally , due to increased technology and the saturation level of the market , cars come to the consumers at lower costs when compared to past .the companies are extending product ranges to cover the maximim number of consumers within a wider range of economic status .therefore cars are more affordable and also convenient to use compared to last two to three decades .i think these improvements will continue with an accelarated speed and cars will reach a wider range of population .even if the frequency of the usage of an individual car might decrease , i think the total number of cars in use could only increase during the next twenty years regarding the above mentioned reasons .
