i believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their lifes , however some people could argue that a successful life stands on what you think is being success for you .it probably depens on the way you have been educated .some people find their success in doing what they are doing good .others are always trying to go a step forward .the unexplored part of going a step forward has a strong risk that people has to take only if they want to .and this is what i believe make us being different or at least , not being as everyone elses .successful is related with being strange , in a unique way , to stand out of the rest of the people .however , i think it is totally related to you own culture .being successful in the united states is not the same of being successful in china or a small town in africa .my personal experience travelling aroung the world has given me a different idea of what is means to be successful in life .usually , i relate the success with my own culture and place it in what we call the first world , which means being successful in bussiness enviroment or economy talking .however i think it is neccessary to take a step back and think of other cultures : being successful could mean be the leader of a small town in india were it is related to the one how was able to do something ( for example bring water to a village from a long_distance river or to be able to kill a lyon in the middle of a forest ) .in all those cases people needed to take risks , but risks that had a meaning on their culture and circumstances .in this sense only people how is brave enough to take the risk have the chance of being different can be successful .i definitely agree with the statement , and actually i believe that people is successful becasue those risk they have taken , have given them their success .
