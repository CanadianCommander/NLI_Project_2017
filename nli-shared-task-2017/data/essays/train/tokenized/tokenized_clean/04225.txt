i strongly believe that in twenty years , there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today .i will present an economic argument and current trends in automotive development to support my belief .i think what the statement is alluding to is the fact that oil is becoming ever more scarce .after all , we can not run our cars without the right fuel .let s consider this situation from an economic perspective .the theory of supply and demand will show that with an increase in price of oil , the demand for cars will decrease , since the two are complimentary goods .intuitively , we know from our every day experiences that we tend to consume less of a good if the price goes up .however , our dependency on cars is so great that despite rising prices , our demand will continue to increase .for instance , imagine a world where you have no access to cars .traveling would become a nightmare .not only that , our economies will suffer from the slow movement of goods and the factors of produciton .due to such unforgiving circumstances , firms , consumers , politicians and dictators alike would choose to pay the higher price rather than suffer the economic consequences .considering the world s present economic development , with the emerging economies of china and india , it is likely that the demand for cars would increase in the future , since more people will have the income to be able to purchase cars .secondly , there is no significant progress in developing suitable alternatives to cars .research in this area has been going on for a long time and remains to be active .however , current proposals of harnessing the power of atomic fusion and hydrogen fuel are not likely to be accepted , due to the danger involved .instead , i think we are heading in the direction of trying to improve the efficiency of cars .for example , we are developing hybrid cars , which run on a combination of electricity and oil , which are about twice more efficient than the conventional cars we drive today .my current knowledge of economics and common sense dictate that the number of cars will actually increase in the next twenty years .
