i disagree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  learning ideas and concepts are as important as knowing the facts .by knowing about the facts , students becomes more practical , they knows what ideas and concepts are been used in this world , by this he comes to know about the real world .having knowledge of only ideas and concepts makes students conservative by knowing facts they becomes outstanding .learning facts makes students complete .it increases their knowledge and they become more innovative .this will improve their performance in studies .just knowing the ideas and concepts without facts keep them in the dark .facts enlighten them .by knowing ideas and concepts they can do good in the exams , but facts make them to do better , when they get jobs .ideas and concepts educates the mind by telling about the subject how it is invented or discovered but facts educates the soul of the students .education , only with ideas and concepts and no facts is waste .suppose for example we have learnt darwin s `` survival for existence  but later we came to know the fact that it was wrong .so , i agree that kowing facts is as important as ideas and concepts .
