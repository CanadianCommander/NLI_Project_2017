in general i agree with this statement .to support my opinion we should have a look on the markt of the 21st century .there is too little space for all the products that companies can produce and sell to consumers .so there is a big supply surplus on the market and every company has to look for a way to get the consumers attention .big marketing studies were done in the last years to teach the company how to sell more products .ther are 3 strategies in advertising a product .the price strategiy , the product strategy and the promotion strategie .the markteting strategy wecomplain in the statement is the promotion strategie .in this strategy companies make their products in advertisments much better than they really are .this marketing strategy gives the product an additional value and according to this an additional reason to the consumer why to buy the product of this or that company .but in realety the consumer is confused .he is overloaded with information of the advertisements .to escape this confusion he often compare the prices of the products and not the additional value .it is also a fact that a consumer will not buy a product again that could nt gave him what he expacted .thats no problem in the short therm but in the long term mouthpropaganda will lead to the effect that nobody will buy this product anymore .in my opinion the best strategy to advertise products is the product strategy .in this strategy companies look for a niche where they can satisfy
