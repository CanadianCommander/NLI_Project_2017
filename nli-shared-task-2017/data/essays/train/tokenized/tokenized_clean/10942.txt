cars are the most convinient way to travel .unlike public transport , you can go exectly where you want - without waiting , without detours .if zou have a lot to transport , like a peace of furnature you can just put it in the trunk - given that zour car is big enough .riding by bus would be very impractical , getting through the doors , finding enough space .you might thing that the bus is ceaper , and maybe sometimes it is , but as soon as you are nt traveling alone the expensives for the fuel can be shared .time is also of importance , even trains beeing very fast traveling from one citz to another , you normaly need a lot of time until you reach your final destination .you will have to get a bus or subway , which may be late , and in the end you would have been quicker using a car .besides of being more practical , there is also a psychological aspect to it .your car is something you have earned , somthing you can be proud of .and most important , it belongs to you .so you are not quit in public when you drive your car .it s like you are still on your own teritorry .and it is also a common symbol of status , and who wants to give that up ?i shure do not .of cause there are problemes , like rising fuel prices .but i think that ways will be found to solve them .even today there are cars which dont need fuel based on oil .so when the last oilwells dry out , the cars wo nt lack of fuel - because when it happens cars wo nt need fuel anymore .i think the car is so convinient , and liked by so many of us , that we will find a solution to any problem that might endanger our beloved automobil .
