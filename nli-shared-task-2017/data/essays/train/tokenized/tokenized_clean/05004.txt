i agree that it is important for student to understand ideas and concepts for several reasons .first , it is good to understand the ideas and concepts .because if they understand ideas and concepts , they can study more easy , and they are might interested in the ideas and concepts .for example , when i studied at school , my teacher did not teach ideas and concepts .therefore , i was always comfused about it , and i did not understand what they want to say or what they want to teach us .therefore , i think they should teach ideas and concepts .second , if they understand it , they can say their opinion about these .i think that it is connect with develope about ideas and concepts .if they can say opinion and the opinion is good or useful , it is good to develope these .and it is goodfor students to practice saying opinion .third , if they understand ideas and concepts , it is might useful in their future .if they do not understand ideas and concepts , they are not interested in these , and they think they do not want to use in future .i think if they know ideas and concepts , they are going to want to learn more or they want to know fact .if teacher want student learn more , i think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
