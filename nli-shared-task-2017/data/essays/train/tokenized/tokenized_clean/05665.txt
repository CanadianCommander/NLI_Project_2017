some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .other people believe in the other way which is older people have a more enjoyable life than young people .as far as i concern , the latter is more reasonable than the idea mentioned earlier for the following reasons .in the first place , young people have more responsibilities , which would allow them have less time to enjoy the wonderful things in their lives , than elderly , as a older people , in a sense , there is no duty , such as rising a child , paying taxes , and educate the next generation ; on the contrary , these responsibilities are , now , weighted on the shoulders of younth .they need to worry about many things , including how to hold their jobs .and it is also the truth that an increasing amount of time is being spent in the work place in order to hold the position they hold now .that means less and less time will be available for them to enjoy the life .in the second place , older people have a more peaceful mind to enjoy the life .these is a growing tendecy for people to lose their ambition as their age is going up .comparing to the young people , elderly feel more comfortable with the life they are having now ; unlike older people .young people are always on the way to seek something better , something they think deserve better .this makes them always on the process of chasing , leaving no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are having now .finally , older people can do numberous things that young people are not able to do .with the repect for older people taking more and more important place in an increasing number of people , people now build many places only for old people , and make more entertainments for the older .these programme are more suitable for elders .that s reason some of the shows can not be understood by the young people .all in all , young people cant not enjoy their life as much as older people do beacuse they are having less time , and ambitous mind to chase others thing .in addition , they ca nt understand something that elders do .however , i believe that in the future , young people will enjoy life in a same amount that older people do .
