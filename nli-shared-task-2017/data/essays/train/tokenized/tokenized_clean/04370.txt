in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i do nt agree with this statement because everyone wants to have a car .in this essay i will give some reasons why i have this opinion .first of all and that s in my opinion the main reason why i think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today , is that most of the people get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reputation and to look great , that s why most rich people want to have the newest and best looking cars at the moment .in addition to that the cars are getting cheaper with the time because the automobile industry produce more cars .another reason is that the youth want to have cars earlier so they get cars often as a present .today the people do nt really want to live anymore in the cities , so they move to the suburbs and sometimes it is nt possible to reach other places without problems , then it is more practical to have very early a car to be more independent .in my opinion in few years the cars will have such a high technical standard which is better for the environment than today and this will be another important reason why there will be more cars in the future than now .in conclusion i disagree with the statement and with the reasons i have listed above i support my opinion .people will earn more money not to have only one car , but two or three .then a new technology will appear in a few years , and will be a second reason why car driving wo nt be worse for the environment anymore .the last reason will be that people will move from the cities to the suburbs .
