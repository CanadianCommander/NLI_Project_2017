first of all allow me to say that i totally agree with the idea that it is much more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts .the importance of understanding underlying ideas instead of only learning mere facts can be summarized by saying that a student that has learnt by heart a lot of facts can be defined for sure as a student with a lot of notions but at the same extent can surely find him or herself in a lot of problems when trying to apply the facts they know in order to understand different situations .let  think of history as an example .if it is true that on one side it is certain that a student must learn a series of facts that have determined the historical events of a certain age , on the otherone it is equally certain that a student that does not understand all the drivers and all the underlying causes that driven those facts will never be able to really understand what has happened thus impeeding himself or herself to avoid same mistakes made by former generations and to replicate the succesful ideas applied to differnt contexts .obviously this is just an example but basically all subjects can be used as examples in order to sustain the importance of understanding more than learing by heart .take math as a last example .if a student learns by heart a math rule without understanding the general sense of it , he or her will only be able to apply the memorized rule if it presents itself in the exact same form of the rule studied by heart .well this is simply impossible in maths since a particular rule has to be applied to a potentially infinite variety of possible occasions .as i was saying , since learing by heart something infinite is impossible , understanding is the only possible solution for a student .these are only two examples , but the same concept applies to basically all the subjects that student approach during their accademic years , thus understanding is fundamental whilst learing fact is a waist of time .
