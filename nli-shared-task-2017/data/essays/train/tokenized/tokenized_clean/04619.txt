well , this is an interstiong topic to be written about .coming to the point of knowledge , it means that mastering a field of work at study .and this is divided into many branches like different subjects we take .many people try to take a few subjects or a single subject alone for their study .this also counts for the field out of education system .this could be for the reason that they are interested in it and like to work on it .and moreover , people who are job minded , would work inyensively on their subject of choice to master it and a good job based on it , leaving the other subjects unexplored !according to me , the involvement of a person in a particular type of job is totally need based .but i would prefer to work on all the areas ad gain knowledge of everything around me , then concentrate on what i need to .this could be a pretty way to do our job .you will have the minimum kowledge of everything .this ought to be followed because , you can not keep quite when group of your friends is discussing about a particular topic .you need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discussion .or else it would look odd if you dont join the talk .afterall our skills are guessed by rthe work we put up .and we can also advice some person in a familiar topic we know .for example , lets take a person who is very well aware of a subject in which he is interested , but is unaware of many other things .and take person who does knows about all the things he is interested , and also the other things .for instance let us assume an interview conducted for each person .and in todays world , a person who knows his subject of interest and the other things also , is only accepted .that would keep him as an allrounder .though the other person is a master in his subject of interest , that alone would not help him .lastly i conclude that , `` a sight towards the alrounder is always different from that towards a fish in a pond , which , though knows everything about the pond but never knows anything about thje world around it .
