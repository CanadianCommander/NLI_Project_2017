the best way to explore a city or a hole country is with a good group of people and an excelent tour guide .city knowledge , fun and respect are well related with this statement .when you first travel to a new country it is important to find someone that can take you to the places that you can not miss in your trip .eventhough you can get some knowledge from books and internet about the cities and important places , tour guides give you the exact information you need to know such as theorical facts but also myths , leyends and beliefs , which many times are more interesting and not found in books .besides city knowledge , traveling with a goup of people is a very interesting activity because you get to know new persons with different characteristics which help you understand different cultures , attitudes and ways of thinking .for example , the first time i traveled to europe i did it with a big group of people , although they were all mexicans i realized there are a lot of different customes in my own country .it was a great experience because it encouraged new friendships .finally , respect is a value well-related with this kind of trips .time is an important aspect .a lot of times we do not think about people s time , but in this kind of trip everyone depends in the other so punctuallity is a very important topic .there i understood an excellent frase from an argentian economist named david konsevic : `` never take people s time , when you do this you are taking part of their lives  .not only time but also respect for people s beliefs and customes which in many cases are different from ours and some times hard to understand .in conclusion , by experience i can support the statement which mentions that traveling with a group led by a tour guide is best way to do this activity because of better city knowledge , fun and learning to respect people s time and beliefs .
