nowadays , the used of cars is widely spread aroud the world .never the less , it is differently distributed depending on the caracteristic of the coutries , and on the level of development .some governments are trying to desentivate the use of cars because of pollution , and even to precent accidents .in addition , some people are looking for other kinds of less expensive ways of transportation , taking into account the increase of oil prizes .it is very hard to say though , that these governmental and particular initiatives are going to be the same in all the countries and that are going to have the same consequences .in europe , with small countries , where there is not enough space , where the cities are crowded and very near to other one , it is relatevily easy to make public policy to decentivate the use of cars .indeed sinde the 70 s , after the first oil boom , the use of cars , or big cars have decreased .governmets promote the use of trains and subways on the main cities .the space and parking problem in the biggest cities is another reason why people can prefer more are more to use public transportation rather than cars .in europe , it is very common to see more and more during the warm seasons the use to bicycles not only to go to college , but also to go to work .and governments incetivating these kinds of solutions by building bicycles roads .on the other hand , in places sucn as the united states where the biggest part of the cities are widespread on a several number of kilometers despite their small size , it could be very hard to desincentivate the use of cars even with public policies .indeed , only big metropoles such as new york , los angeles , chicago , could easily respond to policies such as those made in europe .the traffic is soo messy , and the space so reduce , that in twenty years it would be natural to use fewer cars .however , in smaller and spred cities , the use of cars is essential .they do nt face the same problems of space , parking , and pollution of the big metropoles .their problem is more about distance , and about oil .one fact that could really reduce then the number of cars in those places is to face oil scarce and therefore a huge prize raising .and facing this problem , public policy could be not enough to solve the problem , since those cities are made to ride on a car .to summarize the use of cars in twenty years can be very different depending on the economic situation of the worl in that moment and on the oil prizes .
