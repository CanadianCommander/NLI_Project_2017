young people enjoy life more than older peopleit is convercial to say that young people are more happy than older people .but i would say that when people are young , they enjoy their lives by being with boyfriends and girlfriends .they like travel all over the world and get a chance see the tourist place .if they have their wives with them , they enjoy their lives sexually .some people young people are homosexual and some young people prefer to have a sex with young girls .they are really happy to enjoy doining sex .but it is not always true that young people enjoy their life .because in this age stage , young people have a responsibilty to look for their families , so they have to work more in their young stage .in another side , older people are also happy in the older age .because they do not have to work much more in this age .their life is happy .they do not spend much more time on work because already have gone through their working stage .in some countries , government also suppot to the older peope financially .so in this age , most of the older people spend their time to eat in hotels and restaurants .in villages , older people like to spend their time with their grand childrens , and sitting together with older people and making comedies and jokes .in this age age older people also spend their lives by sharing their ideas and opinion with their older frineds .but there are also some other bad experiences with older people in this age .even if older people have worked enough in their younger stage and earned a lot of money , sometime their young childrens do not accept them to stay together .they are also not able to enjoy their life sexually in this stage .to sum up , both sides are equivalents in the daily life of the young and older people .
