divided into two kinds of eduction , schools are focus on different methods of education .however , they can be distincted into two portions , one is focus on having broad knowledge , the other is focus on having specialize in one specific subject .both of these two ways are leading students to the prosperity in the future , and sure can be successful if the right education is given .but which one of these two ways can lead a more prospective future ?that can be a question we have to consider .however , i vote for the method , i m been taking , that is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .living in the developed world , nowadays , we , the new generations , have gotten more and more burdans .the technology is growing faster and faster , more and more knowledges should be used in only one job .to have different knowledges in different part of academic subjects has become more and more useful .a worker who want to earn more payment needs more knowledges in different academic subjects , to make the work s/he is doing get better .with the developement of the technology , to much knowledge a person need to know to work with an equipment , an equipment may needs the knowledge of electronic , computering , programming and so on .my father is an manager of guizhou north power , for instant , he needs the knowledge of programming to program the programs of computer that used in equipments , he needs to have the knowledge of electronic for the using of the program , he also needs the knowledge of management to make the company better .to much works need the broad knowledge that can the developement of the company get fast .what about the knowledge of specialize in one specifc subject , it s not adequate any more .for a job , a person wo nt do it best when s/he only have the single knowledge in one specific subject .the person may good at accounting , but not good at using computer ; a person may good at mathematics , but do not no how to use it .this can cause a gift person lost his job and destroy the one s future .so , what i think is that the single knowledge in one specific subject like spin , it can destroy the bulloon in your hand .not useful any more in the new generation , the single knowledge in one specific subject can make the person do not know how to use his tellent .to have broad knowledge can make the person easier to use his knowledge and become successful in the future .
