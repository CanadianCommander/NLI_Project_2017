for me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this wey we can have more possibiliy to change my life .for example , i can specialized in one specific subject but the future can reserve me a lot af problems and so i can costrec to change my work and in this case it is very important have a big knowledge .in fact , for your private live , a broad knowledge is more valuable than a specialised one .a broad knoweledge can halp you in a different situations , for example to try a new job .for this reson , we must study a lot of subjects and we must try to have a big knowledge for all and different situations .whith a broad knowledge you can communicate with everyone about everything .so it is very important read many newspapers and a lot of books .but , it is important tell that in some case we can specialize in one specific subject .but , in these day there is a specialist for everythins and it is not to easy to find a topic to do research on .you have to knew everything about your topic and this is very difficult .at the and , i think that a broad knowledge is better for all the people and it is very important .
