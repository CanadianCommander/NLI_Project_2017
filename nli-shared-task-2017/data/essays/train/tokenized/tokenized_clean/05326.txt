because of the importance of advertisements in our modern society , this question seems quite interesting and could be also written this way : do advertisements lie to us ?it always seems to us that the goods we see on tv or in magazines are perfect , or far better than they actually are , and we are often disappointed by the real products once we have bought it .but could an advertisement work if he told us that what he wants us to buy is only quite good or not that bad ?advertisements are closer to propaganda than information and it ca nt be helped .on an other hand , some advertisements are willing to give some results or marks that their products were given by different organisations , associations or consumers and we re eager to believe that , most of the time .we must nt forget that customers are usually well protected by laws which punish lies in advertisements but here is nt the problem .indeed , the problem is that people usually do nt make any differences between the picture and the thing itself , and are too eager to think that what they see just in front of them is real and ideal .they always look for something perfect but ca nt realise that perfection does nt exist , moreover low-cost perfection .advertisements show us the best sides of what they want to be baught and it could nt be an other way , we ca nt blame it for that and furthermore we should face our own responsabilities by training to be more critical and careful in our decisions .the fact is that advertisements do nt make products seem far better than they really are because only the consumer see what is beautiful , it s a kind of game with the consumer who stay the only one to decide if he actually like , need or want .
