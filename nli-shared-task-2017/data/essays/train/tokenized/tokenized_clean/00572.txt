the question being raised is if i agree or not to the idea that advertisements make a great impact in products .this is an important issue to consider because advertisement is part of our daily life .today if you want to sale any product you most think in how to advertise it .i totally agree that a good advertisement in front of your store help your business to attract more people .in order to have this product sale you most develop a good strategy , and follow some rules .first of all , to sale products you need good avertisement and a good strategy .that definitly will attract other people to your business , and it will help you to give a presentation of your products .for example , if i have a store that sale house ornament , it is necesary to have all kinds of neon sings that make allusion of the product on sale .other way is to bring some ornaments outside the store and let people who pass by stop and take a close look .this is an strategy that every one can practice .furthermore , to sale product and make then look bettter than they realy are , you do not have be unthrusful .instead , you just have to follow some rules that are applicable to every business , small or large .the first thing is to put the nicest product at the entrance of the store .this way people will be attracted to the rest of the products .i remember one time i was tried to make a garage sale .at that time what i did was just to follow the old rule .my neighboords started to came , and at the end of the day every thing was sold .after all , i agree with the statement that advertisements make product seem more attracted .even though some people believe they do not needed to sale a product , i would never have good resolt in my little business experiences if i did not used a plan and follow some rules .
