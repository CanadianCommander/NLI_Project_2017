some tipes of advertisements use to make different products , and a lot of them are , better it s say that they seem , much better than they really are .is it true or wrong ?it is good or bad ?do i agree or disagree with the statement written at the top ?i really do nt know .i ca nt find a personal and not common opinion about this themes , for that reason i will say sorry before for the not really interesting text that i m going to write , or better that i m going to try write .first all the advertisements can be devide in two groups .the first one comprend all the advertisement who use to give products as soon as possible , the second one , at the contrary , used to give products in a log way .in the same line i d like to devide all the products in two order , the really `` good  and the `` appeared good  .after this tipe of division is possible to combinate in different way all groups .so we can find advertisemtent who gives to you a products really soon and whit a lot of good things correlated at its , or at really opposite concept , an advertisements who gives in a really long period something not really good for your person .i m going to the conclusion of this issue , and i want to declarate that this is a really difficult topic where i have trought to give my opinion or something who try to be the same shape .if i have to take one decision about what tipe of advertisement i will choose , i hope to find a product whio can give to me a seem better than it look likes .whit that i hope to be finisched all my argouments ad ideas about this really diffucult and embarasing issue .
