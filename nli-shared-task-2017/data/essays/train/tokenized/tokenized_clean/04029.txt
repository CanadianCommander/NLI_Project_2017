i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , people in japan study a lot of facts , such as history and math instead of idea and concept class when they were in elementary school , junior high school and high school .it is too much time to learn facts .they should study class which understand ideas and concepts .second , almost people have pc , tv , tv game and cell phone , so they do nt like thinking something .children often play the tv game in their house , instead of go out with their friend .
