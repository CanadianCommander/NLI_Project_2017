it is pointed out that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities especially in the big city like tokyo where i live , for following two reasons .firstly , it is true that for young people there are more and more things to do than the people who lived 50 years , for example , watching tv , talking on the phone with their friends , useing computer , doing homework and so on , and that young people do not have time to helping their communities .nowadays , young people have to get a great many of imformation to communicate with other people .for example , in the school they can not talk each other without same imformation like popular tv program and popular magazines .so they do not have enough time to give time to helping their communities .secondly , there is little chance to have experience of feeling about commutities especially in the big city .in the big city , people are tend to live in big buildings rather than their own house .several years ago , there were little big buildings and people lived in their own house .so young people had chance to play in their communities .however , nowadays young people do not have chance to have experience of feeling .so , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities especially in the big city like tokyo where i live .they do not have enough time to give time to helping their communities .
