the youngster have always been watched upon .their activities and nature have always been watched and analysed .same is the case nowadays .i do support the topic these days it has been analysed young people do not give enough time in helping there communities .there are several reasons for such a behaviour .firstly , these days the youngsters are more busy in their routine work as compared to that in prior days .let us take the example of schools .the course curriculum is becoming more vast and harder day by day .to cover all this and to attain good scores students are forced to devote extra time in their studies that earlier could be used in helping communities .as a personal example , my younger sister who is 5 years younger to me , studied java in 9th standard which i studied in 12th standard .thus a ninth standard student was suppose to do something which was earlier fit for 12th satndard student .so a student had to give extra time to learn something earlier considered of higher standard .secondly , with the passage of time interest of youngsters have changed .it is a clean observation that earlier youngster were interested in helping and social work .on contrary , younsters today are more fun-loving .they pay weightage to moving out with friends , enjoying etc. rather than helping others .as an example , my grandfather was a social worker as well as a student when he was 18 , while at the same age i am just a student .this is also an cosequence of first point .as youngsters have less time to enjoy , they use it to its full extent .finally , the youngsters are reluctant to help a community due to the following reason .as the man has developed since past , it has become more selfish .a very violent example is of the wars that we see all through time .this selfishness has been embeeded in man since ages and can be said to passed on genetically .so youngsters today are more selfish and therefore prefer to help themselves rather than others .that is the reason why a social worker outshines in this world where selfish people are widespread .thus it can be clearly proved on the basis of points mentioned above that youngsters do not to give enough time to helping communities .
