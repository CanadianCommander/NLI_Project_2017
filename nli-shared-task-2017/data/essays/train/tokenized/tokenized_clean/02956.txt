it is commonsense to argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .nevertheless , in a society in which growing up adults is becoming increasingly difficult , there are many reasons to question the above view .in other words , in todays , world , older people are well placed to enjoy life more than young people do .to start with , young people often have to struggle to get on in their carriers .consequently , rather than enjoyng their free time , they are prone to use their free time to improve their working skills or to work extra hours , to demonstrate that they are good workers .in constrast , older people , who have already achieved their professional success , may enjoy more leisure time than they did in their past .another reason that may explain why younger people do not enjoy life that much is that they are still in search for their sentimental equilibrium .young people are more vulnerable to love than older people are and this , in turn , may destabilize them .for instance , when a young falls in love with someboody and the relationship breaks up , his/her reaction is much more magnified as compared to an old man/woman reaction .indeed , old people , who are are more experienced in sentimental affairs , react to sentimental failures with a touch of philosophical detachment !the discussion led so far is not meant to imply that old people have not problems .they face severe issues such as living alone or getting used to their retirement from previously held activities .despite the potential severity of these problems , however , i think that the problems that young people face are greater than the ones old people do .struggling to get a rewarding job or creating a family are two of the biggest challenges human beings go through their lives .having already passed through them , old people have a clear comparative adavantage .
