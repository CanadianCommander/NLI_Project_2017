it is usually said that life is short and nobody should waste his time .i think that it is talking about both young and older people .however young ones are physically capable of having more enjoying experiences than older ones so does it mean that young people enjoy life more than older people ?not really to my mind .the priorities of both are totally different , for instance young people can enjoy highschool or college and what goes along ( parties , trips , human experiences ) nevertheless older people would actually enjoy having time for themselves or those they love .if we take a grand mother as an exemple , she mainly worries about her grand children and her children , she enjoys witnessing her grand son growing into a remarkable person .older people are more concerned about their own family instead of their own satisfation and that is what makes them happy .of course she still takes care of herself and has her own way to entertain herself however it will not be the same as when she was still in highschool , she might want to become gardener or travel all around the world , but her needs are more cultural and family-like than those of young peoplenow , if i take a sixteen-years-old boy , it is significally different .indeed his first concern is his own satisfaction although he also cares for his family .nonetheless he wants to have fun with his friends going out or playing sports .his needs are personal and simple .he just have to seize the day without having to worry about his salary or his electricity fees .he is not responsible yet so he is enjoying life without having the same concerns as an older person .to conclude with , i would say that both enjoy life as much as they can even though there still are exceptions .this does not apply only for teenagers and aged people but also for every category of ages .eventually , a teenager will grow and change , so will his interests and his way of enjoying life .
