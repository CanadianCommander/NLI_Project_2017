i agree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .just like math , ideas and concepts are processes and answer is facts .i think most of the teacher would like students to understand solve problem s process not understand what the answer is .if you have right process for the problem but get wrong answer that teacher suppose give you point , if you get right answer but your process not correct that will let your teacher doubt you `` how did you get this answer ?understand process that would easier to know how to solve the problem but know the answer ca nt sure you know how to solve problem .it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .facts are dead , ideas and concepts are living .fact always have one but you may have the other thinking in the mind for your ideas or concepts and if you study deeply , it may overthrow original facts .that why understand ideas and concepts is more important for learn facts .sometimes learning ideas and concepts can make you easier to understand , we can find something trick among them .what is your thinking , your concepts or your ideas , like math have many of way to solve problem not just one .
