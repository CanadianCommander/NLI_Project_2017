i agree that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .first , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can provide a more practical approach to choosing the special interests of a person .this is because , if one specializes in one specific subject without having a broad knowledge in other areas , one will not be able to discern his/her real area of interest .this is why students in most educational institutions learn math , language , science , social studies , art and others subjects intensely for several years at least .after having a firm understanding of these areas , will then the students choose and study their special interests in universities .secondly , having a broad knowledge of many subjects can help people to become more flexible in their studies .for example , one of my friends went to a vocational school that specialized in science .however , her interests changed and she no longer wanted to study science .however , because she had specialized in one specific subject/area , she took double the time and made twice the effort in changing her field of study than i would have .unlike her , i had studied a wide variety of subjects and so i could have been more flexible with my studies .lastly , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes it easier to relate to people who have different interests or backgrounds .however , people who specialize in one specific subject might face challenges when trying to relate to a more diverse group of people .this will lead them to miss out experiencing many aspects of diversity .looking at the current educational systems and reflecting on past experiences , it can be concluded that having a wide range of study is more useful and convinient than a focused range of study .
