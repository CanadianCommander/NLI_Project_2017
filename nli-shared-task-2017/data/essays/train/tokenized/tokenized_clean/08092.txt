i totally agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one spesific subject .one good example of an academic subject is medicine .i have a friend who study medicine at medical scool right now .she often tells me about her school and about doctors .now i will explain following reasons and examples which i heard from her to support my opinion .first , it is difficult to diagonise desises .for example , if you are an ophtalmologist and one patient came and she insisted that she could nt see well .you checked her eyes but noting was wrong with her eyes .in that case , there might be something wrong with her brain .however if you do nt have any knowledge about a brain , you ca nt think about it .you ca nt save the patient from her eye sight problem .we ca nt say that you are a good doctor .second , if you have only have knowkedge about medicine , it is fun to talk with others about medicine .probably you will be speaking with other doctors only .however there are many kindsof people in this world .you can gain and learn many thing form talking with them .you do nt talk only about medicine with them .a lot of knowledge will help you to communicate with others and make friends .from these reasons and examples , i think we shoud have many kinds of knowledge .it is fun to study one feild and specialize it .however while we specialize one subject , we should also study broad subject .this will make us to have a lot of friends an knowledge in our lives .
