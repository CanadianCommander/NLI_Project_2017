successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with the statement .sucessful people always try new things if they take risks .pesonally , they do nt care about risks and they are sick of their boring life , i suppose .among many reasons , the most important reason is that successful people have an ambitious in their mind .they always try to obtain their new ways .because they want to be the first one .they think , being best is more important than doing best .to be the first is a big achievement .additionally , they need strengthen their own company if they have it .it is not easy to make more strengthen it .but they know how to manage their own money and how to manage people .because they are successful people already .to sum up , i would like say that sucessful people have an ambitious .
