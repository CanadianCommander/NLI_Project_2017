i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .people in the future , they will not use cars as much as today , because they will be more awareness about the polution or negative effects of using cars , and there will be many other transportation ways except cars since the technology will get much and much better .in twenty years , people who live there will not use cars as much as nowadays , because they will pay attention about the negative effects very much .for example , even in today , there are many television programs which alert of using cars too much .they usually say using too much cars will cause global warning and it will endanger humans .like this , there will be more television programs or other media which talk about the negative effect of using cars in the future , it will make people think they should not use cars .it will cause less people will buy their cars .there will be fewer cars in the future .people who live in twenty years will not use cars as much as nowadays , because there will be many ways of transportation except cars , since there will be much better technology .for example , in japan , especially around tokyo , there are high skill of trains .there are more than 50 lines of trains around tokyo , and people do not use cars that much there , since there are enough trains to go to their destinations .although japan produces cars very much too , the more convinient trains make the less people use cars there .therefore the high technology let us use another transportations , but not cars .i think people who live in twenty years will use fewer cars than today .alerting many negative results of using too much cars makes people do not use cars , and having a better technology like trains makes less people who have to use cars .i hope environment will become better because of fewer cars in the future .
