to try new things and learn about new things is always good thing and get advantage from trying .i agree with the idea of successful poeple try new things and take risks even if they know how to do well .it will be always puls things for them .and also trying new thing can improve themselve and might realize and find out thing that they did not know about .one of my best friend , she started belonging to basketball team .she was really good at most of kind of sport so of course she was the number one person of beginer .she started paly basketball for not serious reason like she just wanted to belong to someting to spend time of her asterschool for fun .after while , she started be absent for practice becouse she knew that she plays the best in the team and she believe that she is always the best for sports .one day , there was a game for tornament and coach was going to call the name of player .but my friend was not called .since she started skipping practice , other girls are getting better becouse they were trying and trying to get better .i thought she needed to try more hard even if she does better than anyone .after that , she started to try and go to practice and the next game she was called as a player and she plays even better than before .in conclusion , i thgouht , to trying is always puls thing to do even for the successful people .and what i think of successful people is who try hard and always try new things and take risk .even if they know things already then they do not try , i think those people are not successful .so i agree with the state of succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
