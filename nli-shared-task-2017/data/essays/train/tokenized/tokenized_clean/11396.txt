in my opinion this question needs to be dealt with in a differentiated way , there are pros and cons .a significant argument in favor of the statement is that certain developpments which currently take place , lead to a higher degree of egoism among the people .we live in a world , which globalizes more and more , there is more competition and everything becomes increasingly busy and difficult .one has to face unemployment or lower wages unless you are better than others , one has to dominate others in a certain way .i think this quite general phenomenon gradually leads to a change in social behaviour , which expresses itself for example in a lack of young people , willing to help their communities .furthermore young peoble are in many cases not willing to help in their community for the simple reason that other things are more entertaining .why should they help older people or do some cleaning job when they could alternatively spend their time playing computer games , watching a series in television or hanging out with friends .young people are nt sufficiently taught that it can be far more interesting to help others and to improve the community experience .on the other side there are also some argument against this statement .the existence of a considerable number of organizations in ther welfare-sector and the fact that young people are integrated in these organizations serves as a proof against the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are religious organizations , sport clubs and political parties which dedicated themselves to the duty of helping in their community and the y have many young members .apart from that the civil service is the germnan alternative to the militarz service .for the period of one year young people can help in there communities .
