as far as i am concerned , i totally agree with the statement stating that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .the reasons that why i think like this , are the followings : general academic knowledge within a broad range is a required item for the increasing interdependency between certain academic fields and provides the ability for the people in order to adopt the common language in the academic environment .firstly , nowadays , academic fields begin to be very correlated with each other .for instance , i am an undergraduate student in a bioinformatic major and i am taking courses from computer science , biology , electronics and statistics .since there begins to be believe that integrative approaches may be more successfrul from pure biological , computational and statistical approaches , lots of academicians from different fields come together , share their ideas and efforts to provide a productive effort .in my internship , i witnessed this working environment very closely in stanford university , because we are colloborating with the medical school as the statistics department .in order to understand these common approaches , i had to gain a knowledge about both medicine and statistics .apart from this increasing connection between certain fields , there is a common language in the academicians .for the people aiming to be a academician in the future , it is a must to have a general knowledge .since they have a lot of friends of academicians from various areas , they have to interact their colleagues in the academic environment .they must perceive even a little about what their friends are talking in their fields .they must express their ideas about various fields in an academic talk .they can obtain this ability by trying to learn about different fields .because of the above mentioned reasons , i would prefer to have a general knowledge than specializing in a specific field .
