i do nt think that learning facts is less important than understanding ideas or concepts : both are demanding skills of our society and are useful in different situations .there are situations that require the ability of understanding ideas like those in which a student is asked to solve a new problem .but there are also situations like a scientist in a laboratory where either he knows how the chemical reaction is being evolving or he risks serious damages .in other words , sometimes it is essential to know facts .we can capture another aspect if when comparing this two activities we argue that learning is not so expensive like understanding .i do nt believe that .for some people it is very difficult to keep in mind even a telephone number , so i think that the cost of learning may vary from one individual to another .in conclusion it depends from the situation .mathematicians are notably asked to understanding ideas , but are we sure that they also do nt learn facts ?no .
