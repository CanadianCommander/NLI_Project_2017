many people have diffrent ideas about whether they have to chose the risk or a normal life .i agree with people who take the risk to successful by trying new things .to be a succssful person intends to take the risk for several reasons .first of all , a successful perons has more ability to discover thing than the other .he or she will be able to develope her or himself in many thing .for example , to be a good singer you have to try to go in front of people and let them lestian to your songes .i called that as risk because not all people would support you but they will give you thier oppinon whether you get the level where you are ablr to start .the second a succssful people have to take many chances whether they get a benfit even thought they make mistake .no argument about whcih learning any thing comes with make mistake .trying to do thing and you faild does nt mean you lost somthing .it means you get more information about what have you been doing .for example , one day i was trying to fix my laptop suddenly i broke the keyboard .so i learned that i have to pay more attintion with these machains beacuse it is a flexible .third , we are not be able to survive if ther is no one take the risk .most people are rely on the others so they wo nt do anu thing .however , if people will have done that we woild gotten any technical thing as whay we are using now adays .these thing comes out if taking its risks .for example , findig the oil under the ground was a drastik decition had been made by the united england back in many years .they work hard to find all vaulbe things that help us to live our life .in conclustion , to be a successful persone has its own risk but it helps for many things .we are not be be able to accomblish in our klife if did nt take these riskes .
