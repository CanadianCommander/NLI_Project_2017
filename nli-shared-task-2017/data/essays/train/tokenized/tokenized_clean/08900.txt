there is no doubt in saying that advertisements shows products in much impressive than the actual products .there is a saying in english , `` first impression leaves better impression  .manufactres wants to persuade people with perpetuating impression in the first instance itself .first , manufactures of soft drinks spend millions of dollars for promoting their drinks .famous actrors or actress serve as brand ambassdor to their products to lure the customers .they claiam that this is the best possible , energetic drink one can imagine .infact it is not true .just plane water could be more refreshing , rejuvineating than soft drink .it is one of the leading cause of diabetes mellitus , becuase it contains lot of sugar products .some studies have shown that there are traces of pesticides in soft drink .inspite of all this disadvanates they are promting thier products by attractive packaging and advertising .second , now let us consider fast food advertisiments .thier advertisements suggests that they are healthiest foods on can imagine .howeer that is not the case .each sandwitch in a restarant may contain more than 1000 kcal .there is some recent strong evidence suggest that schooll children in usa are becoming obese by eating restaurent food .we can see the pictures of the food on posters .it looks very appeeling .however we can not be sure hat are ingriednts , whwre it came from .how many times did they used same oil .i beacme ill several times after eating cafteria food .single can of tuna and could be much nutrious than high fat food avialable fast food hotels .third , toy manufactures advertises attract lot of children by making wide range of toys .but mant cases toys would not be up to the eexpecation of child .single piece of paper could have been more imaginatve than electronic toy .because it might improve child drawing performance or writing ability .this sort of advanatge , however denied to the toys .in conclusion , i am of the view that people should consdier adevrtisement as a source of information before before buying product .they should be carefull .
