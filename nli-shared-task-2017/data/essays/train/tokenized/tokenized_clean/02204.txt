will it be ever enough to learn ?life is a long and rough journey .whatever we learn either good or bad throughout this journey will be a way of experience for us .i have always been sort of a greedy person .for me it is never enough for anything in life .i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because most important of all it increases a person s self esteem and confidence .actually , this question constitutes a major place in my life .it was the time when i have graduated from high school and was trying to choose what to study in the university .i am not the type who is obsessed with one issue and can spend his or her whole time with it .that is why i have chosen to study sociology in the university .as a matter of fact , i did not know much about sociology at the time , but i knew that i wanted to study a course from which i could gain many things that i can fit into my real life .sociology happens to be a subject that analyses the society , such a broader term .while analyzing the societies , of course we are concerned with many other types of information .since my freshmen year , i have always preferred to choose courses from different majors such as , history , international relations , psychology , literature , economy , statistics and many more .the reason for this choice was because i have always believed that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .according to me , a person who is specialized in one specific topic is much more limited in life regarding his options .what i meant is that , if a person has a knowledge of many different academic subjects than this person always has a say in any conversation he or she engages into .consequently , i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject because it increases self esteem and confidence and this way the person can have a lot to say in any conversation she or he engages into .also , this person can easily understand the on going issues around the world and is capable of making clear on where he or she stands based on his thoughts and beliefs .
