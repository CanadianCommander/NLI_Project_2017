some theories predict that in the next twenty years there will be a decrease in the number of the car in use .i am not sure that this will be the future , but there are many reasons that suggest me that it would be a possible scenario .the first main raison is the energitical problem .everyone knows that oil energy , based on petroleum , might be reduced in the next years and if the fuel for cars is rare , there will be not cars , or at least the cost of petrol will be too high to mantain a car .not everyone who today has got a car , might be able to afford these high expense .the second point that indicates me a possible reduction of cars is related to the pollution .i live in milan , a big city in the north of italy , where the quality of the air is very low because of cars .thus , it is raisonable to think that to solve this the government might forbid the circulation of cars in the city .if it is happens , the number of cars will , certainly , decrease .finally the tecnology evolution allows to think that in the next future the need of cars will be lower and lower .an example comes into mind .in the past everyone had a horse to move , instead now nobody needs a horse because there are cars .in the same way , in twenty years there will be other means of transport faster than cars .in conclusion there are three good reasons to think that the reduction of cars is
