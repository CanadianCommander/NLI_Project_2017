success is a word that brings the glance in people s eyes .i might say that alomost every person in our system tries to get successful .in the end success shows the ability to stand up for something or against something and earn the `` applause  , what mostly appears in money .one one hand there are people who understand the word `` success  in a collective luck .many of these people help other people to get to know the word success .imagine a kid in today s africa .probaly he just tries to survive the night .and in this point people see their on sucess , in helping others to live on and get to know what success could mean .no doubt , it is one of our major problem we have to solve .we must help the people in africa to show them there is an other life than starvation .on the other hand we have people that understand success only for their own benefit .they do things , taking risk just to have their own soul in a good mood .and no matter what , they going to try as hard as they can to achive their goals even if they take other peoples chances and luck .let s say , that today s `` bad guy  are these guys .personally , i think , someone who wants to be successful must have a little bit of both sides .i just can relate from myself .as a former tennis professional i was - and maybe still am - an egoist .starting with tennis i had no choice but to focus on myself and win against my oponent .there is no help from a team mate or a coach during the matches , it is only you .this fact made me somehow an egoist .but it does not mean that i have not learn to think about the others around me .i trz hard to do both ways .however , i had to take risk to achive my goals even if everybody around was laughing at me .on that way , i fully agree with the statement .because floating with the mass is not a way to achieve something .fighting against the mass is the way to become successful .most people are successful if they to something special , somthing noone has done before .if everybody does the same it is hard to outreach the mass , because so many are doing exact the same thing .so , the only way to be successful is , to take risk .
