i heard a joke once that goes like this : god when creating the species gave the dog a life span of 30 years , the monkey 20 years and human beings 20 .but the greedy man asked god for the 30 years the dog had and the 20 years the monkey had and god granted this wish .thats why they say that in the first 20 years human beings enjoy life as they are supposed to , then they get jobs and work like a dog in the next 30 years and then they retire and entertain grandchildren like a monkey in the remaining 20 .alltough this joke is nt entirely related to my thoughts it shows that in the first 20 years human being have more fun then in their older age .so i personnaly agree that young people enjoy life more since they have very few cares or responsibilities in life , raging hormones which make them feel more lively and bigger hopes for the future which make them more optimistic towards life .firstly when a person is young he does nt have any responsibilites that would stress him out .he does nt have to pay any bills , or think about the future of a child or exhaust himself day in and day out in a job .all he has to do is go to school get good grades and thats it .all the rest are problems that his parents have to think about .it is probably the only period in his life that he is only living for ` himself` .not anybody else .secondly a young person has more hormones running through his body during growth .he is wild and crazy and his body is pumping adrenaline and having fun just seems like an instinct .hanging out with friends , going out at night , not caring what to do is a phase that probably all people go through when they are young but seize to do as they get old .the hormones diminish with age and eventually people tend to settle down .last but not least young people have bigger hopes and dreams for the future making them more optimistic towards life .they can dream of their first job , their future spouse or maybe even the first car they will buy for themselves whereas as time goes by the experiences in life stop becoming a first .since they are more enthusiastic towards their future goals they will enjoy everything more compared to a person who finds everything a routine .so in conclusion i agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy life more then older people do since they have less stress causing responsibilities , more hormones to make them feel more lively and , greater expectations in life .
