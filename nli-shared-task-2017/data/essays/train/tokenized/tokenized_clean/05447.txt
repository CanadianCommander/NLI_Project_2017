`` live life kingsize  .this is the statement which i always relate to .so i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .happiness and enjoyment in life , does not fade away with age but more to do with the personality of the person .firstly , there is not any age limit defined for a person to enjoy his life .i have seen people who in their old ages fully enjoy their lives as compared to their young counterparts .so enjoyment in life has more to do with the personality and nature of the person rather than his age .if a person is very jovial and fun loving , he will like to socialise with his friends , go for vacations with the family and will do thinggs that will bring happiness to him .these gestures of happiness and enjoyment can be done by a person of any age .but a person of serious nature , would like to spent his time alone rather then enjoying .enjoyment means different things to different people .for some it might be spending time with family or socialising with friends .for some its going on vacations and exploring new places .some people enjoy doing activities like painting and drama , which make them happy .so there is no specific age to enjoy these things in life .although , one of the reasons that can be stated in favor that young people enjoy life more than older people is that when you are yough you are more physically healthy to fulfil your hobbies and activities , which make you happy .there are certain things that a youger person can do , which an older person might not be able to do which so much of passion and energy .in conclusion , i would like to state that age actually does not matter for a person to enjoy life .it depends on your own outlook and the way you want lo live .so if you are young by heart , dont count your age and enjoy life to the fullest .
