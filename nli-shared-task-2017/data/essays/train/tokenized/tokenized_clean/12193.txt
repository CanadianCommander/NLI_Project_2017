i m agree with this statement because i think that sometimes most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the advertisement is maded generally to achieve the customer s attention because in this way there are more possibility that the costumer buy the product .there are some persons that study for a lot of years to learn the rules of marketing and to learn the right ways to achieve their costumers .today , on television , we can see a lot of beautiful advertisements .we are often intersted and enjoied from they , but when we buy this products in a supermarket often we are not so happy for our purchase .i think that often the advertisements that i see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention .for example next week i saw the advertisement of barilla , a famous firm that products some types of pasta , and i thought that this is made as a little film .it s beautiful because it talks about the life , the ways that childrens have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby , through all of this the advertisement speak also of a new type of pasta called `` piccolini  .i think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that i watch it on tv i really want to buy the product .few days after to have sought this advertisement i have eat this type of pasta and i understood that it is not so good as i believed , infact i prefer so much the normal type of barilla s pasta .therefore i say that often most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are as for example i can understand in tha case of pasta .
