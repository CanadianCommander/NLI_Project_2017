world of advertismentin the competitive environment of business every company tries to prove that it is better than another .one way to give such an impression is `` advertisement  .one aspect of this advertising issue is the conservation of honesty .do the companies prefer their product to be presented in a way better than they really are ?unfortunately , yes they do .this concept will be analysed based on the following arguments : true aim of giving advertisements , when to give advertisements , comparison of the product we see and we buy .to begin with , it should be clear that , companies  intention in giving advertisements is to make their products sold .that is why they give money to advertisement makers , hoping that after this campaign there will be a dramatic increase in the profit of the company .moreover , some companies prefer to give advertisements before a new product is out for sale .due to the fact that no one has ever seen it , they can manuplate the appearance of the product such that it will look perfectly and be more prone to be bought .secondly , a company might plan giving advertisements on products which have a lower selling rate recently .for instance , if a shampoo is not selling enough , the company agrees with a very well known artist or popstar for showing up in an ad and saying `` i am also using this shampoo , if you want to have as beautiful hair as mine you should also use this .actually , most people are aware that she is not using that shampoo .nevertheless , they have a tendency and temptation to buy it .thirdly , apart from the fake suggestions and manuplations done on the picture with the computer , what is shown in the advertisements is the first appearance of the product , not what we buy from the market .there are several steps during transportation and storage where the product might be ruined .on the other hand , if they show us the picture of the product prr to being sold in the market , most probably people will not buy it .as a conclusion , being trustwothy in giving advertisements is not a required behaviour in the area of business .people show their products in such a way that they look better than they really are due to aforementioned reasons such as : why actually they are giving advertisements , at certain time points advertisements are necessary and the product we buy is apparently distinct from the one we see .eventually , these ideas support the hypothesis that advetisements make these products seem better than they really are .
