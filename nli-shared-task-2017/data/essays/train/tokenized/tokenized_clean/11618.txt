i agree the statement that  its important for students to understand ideas and concepts it is formed than it is for them to learn facts  ...at the university ?used to be a stajyer teacher and ?had time to observe students easily .when students starting to learn a new subject the most important thing that the teacher have to learn how much information that the students have about that subject .bas ?cally the way or techniques of teaching to a student starts with testing . ?ts the important way for the way which you are going to teach with .to learn what they know , to grab their attention with chiming them in , to show them most of them in the class do nt know so many things about that subjects , to get their ideas from the name of the subject although they dont know anything on it etc . .when the introduction part finished the other step for teaching is to try the main idea for the subject .this is the most important part .because its the first part that the student start to learn something about that subject and pay the most attention to the teacher with the happ ?ness to learn new things .probably this is the most effective part on the students also if they interested the subject they would love to learn other part of it , if not the attention will fall down .the facts about the subject is less interesting or on the other hand most useful but easily forgetable part .for example think about you when you were at primary school you started to learn how to write and read .are you remember any facts of them or ?can ask you like this ; are they any facts of reading or writing ?i think no !as a result we can say that understanding ideas and concepts of a subject is more important than it is facts .when you a student learn the main idea he/she can use his/her mind easily and get the subject correctly with a help of a teacher or a person .
