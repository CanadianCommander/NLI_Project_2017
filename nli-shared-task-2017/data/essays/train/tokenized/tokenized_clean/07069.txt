i disagree that , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because doing known things perfectly is also equally difficult .also , doing known things well is not easy .intially , for a person to be successful he or she needs to be perfect in their respective fields .so , it is better to master in known field then in unknown areas .in a known area , a person wil be more confident in his or her work .for example , a doctor performs operation in his known area but not on other parts of the body , where his area of study is not concerned .another hypothetical case is , in a known area a person can assume the output .but in an unknown area , a person has no garuntee of success .and also , what to expect as the output .for example , various explorers known their destination point , only then they start their travelling .moreover , for experimenting new things more money would be required .hence , the person should be confident completely before putting huge amounts at stake .for example , funding for satelite where huge money is involved , so much research must be done .also , successful is obtained by combining dedication towards the work , talent , commitment , intelligence and many more features .also , these qualities can be combined only when there is qaruntee about the output .for example , nasa scientists does so much research before working on a new project .they woud not start work in unknown area where there is no qaruntee of output .finally , i conclude by mentioning that success is obtained by those people who are confident in what they are doing .hence , successful people should do things what they already know rather than taking risks .
