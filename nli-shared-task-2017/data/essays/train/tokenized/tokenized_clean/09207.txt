i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .i believe that for many reasons .one of the most important reasons i believe that is more important for students to understand concepts and ideas is that , by understanding concepts , they could develop a critical attitude to the interpretation of facts .students should encouraged to understand ideas that motivate people behaviours , rather than simply learning facts .i think that should be the professor s responsability to discuss in class concepts rather than facts , since it is much more challenging for students to understand concepts on their own .at the same time , if students are interested in learning facts , they can do that by themselves , according to their specific interests .the second reason i think it is more important to learn concepts rather than facts is that this way of learning lasts longer in time and it is less superficial .for instance , i remember that when i was at school i had to learn and memorise a lot of `` facts  that after two days from the exam i had already forgotten .on the contrary , if you understand concepts and ideas , it is much harder to forget what you have learnt .students should be conscious of perpetuating a more `` durable  way of learning and i think that learning concepts is a much more useful way to learn .being more motivate to learn concepts introduces the third reason why i believe it is more important for students to understand ideas .students are more interested in learning about abstract concepts , rather than facts because they could find that ideas and concepts are more applicable to the reality , without being compelled to a certaing period of time for instance .if you have studied .for example , the military techniques that have been used in a particular battle , they can not certainly apply to the real world in which we leave .on the contrary , if you have studied the concept of war and understand what issues it impliies , it could also be applied to the real world .i think that students would be much more fascinated by the concept of war .in conclusion , i believe that it should be given priority to students to understand ideas , by promoting discussions and debates .this is a much less sterile way to learn and promoting education than learning facts .
