young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their cmmunities .as we knowk , the develpment of the world in diffirent waysw is getting increasing more and more .this , will effect the time .let s take the internet as an example , a range of 4 to 6 hours is being spent ; and when you add this to the time that is spent on the education and sleeping we will see mostly no time to help the communities .parents can helpe by teaching them the importance of our communities and we must focus on how can we develope them .keep in mind that young people should be a developer for the communities not only a consumer .these words have to be touhgt in depth to them and sure we will see a good generation that help not only our communities but also our proparaties that exist everywhere .finally , the enviroment where the young people raised in is important with the nature of thier parents .
