personally , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is because young people are more energetic , more healthy and have more adventures .first of all , younger people tend to have stronger bodies ; they are full of energy .they can play a lot of exciting sports .for example , younger people can paly basketball , rock climbing , snowboarding and so on .however , these kinds of sports will not be very good for elders because they tend to be tired very soon and they will not be able to enjoy themselves .moreover , younger people are able to recover very fast after big games so that they can be ready for their next activities .in addition to being more energetic , yonger people are healthier .they tend to have strong bodies because they are growing up instead of getting old .being strong has the advantages of enjoy their lives more .for instance , young people can eat almost anything they want to eat such junk food .this is because they do not have to worry about getting some disease .on the other hand , older people have to worry about their diets all the time because they tend to have problem with illnesses such as diabetes .having healthy bodies truely are the big advantage for young people to enjoy their lives more .finally , younger people will have more adventures .this is because they have more time than the elders do .for example , younger people are able to change jobs once a year , and they are not worried because they can always find a job .even if in a labour work , younger people are fit .they can at least make their ends come meet .most of all , they can spend their leisure time doing lots of activities such as travelling aroung .as for older people , they may not have as much oppotunities as younger people do .they have to be careful all the time and worry about losing their jobs .and they definately do not have the time to explore our modern society .it is clear that younger people will enjoy their lives more .this is because they have more energy .also , they have stronger and healthier bodies .last but not least , they are able to spend more time on coming across their exciting life experiences .
