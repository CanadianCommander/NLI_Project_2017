i agree that it is more important and beneficial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .this is because it is basically the ideas and concepts that lead us to various facts .ideas and concepts form the basis of all the learning .concept defines the rules and regulations assosciated with a certain term .if an individual is clear with his concepts , he can understand everything related to that concept .for example , if a person s english grammar concepts are clear , then he can understand and write any of the views expressed in english language easily .idea is basically a motive behind doing of a certain thing .whatever , we do , we do it with some idea at the back of our mind .for example , if a person is pursuing a management course , he is pursuing it with the idea that a management course will provide him a wide variety of oppurtunities in his career .similarly , various ideas form the basis of our different actions i.e drinking water to quench our thirst , eating food to satisfy our hunger .if a person understand the basic idea behind any task , he will be able to comprehend the implication of that task completely .facts are normally stated .they are the outcome of various observations and experiments performed under certain conditions .but facts do not always depict truth .they may be true in one sense but they might be wrong in some other sense .for example .if an observation states that a particular type of technology is the most sophisticated technology in its field , this might be true for some but for some whose parameters of observation differs from the parameters of earlier observation might not think so .moreover , facts can be altered to meet certain specific objectives .hence , i believe that it is more important and essential for students to get hold of ideas and concepts rather than cramming facts .understanding ideas and concepts will help them think more logically and practically .facts might mislead them but concepts and ideas will always lead them to a logical path .understanding of ideas and concepts makes individual s thought process more effective and efficient .
