johnson & johnson , a successful organization with lots of patented formulas is inventing still more combinations everyday .some of the projects are a big success and some find the way in trashcans .i believe successful people try different things and involve in a lots of risk than just running behind what they have already achieved .life is a series of good and unfavorable things .no one can stop trying just because it has risk involved in it .when individuals endavor a task with lots of deligence some times they make it beyond axpected and some time fail .when people stand up to their life and give everythings they are more likely to become successful .successful people have the greed for success .they willput numerous efforts and try out different methods to make the things happen .once someone becomes successful they also go through undetermined pressure to keep their work and give something extra to the community .brad pitti is a successful filmstar but he just can not stop at action movies such as `` ocean eleven  he felt the need to show his art and success by proving his performance in `` babble  ( a kind of offshore and intense film ) .though people are successful they try to jump further high and take risk and become more successful .astronauts have reached on moon but they di not stop there they invented the satelites which can remain in the vicinity and be usefull for ages .`` newton  successfully established his first law but he continued his contribution and work to the community by establishing two more laws of totally different phenomenons .success is an addiction .in stock excahnge market people often engaged in different short term and long term baits and investments .once they are successful in one bait they explore the market more and tempted to take more risk for more monetary benifits .also when you get success to tend to think more positive about youself and try out many more things which would prove beneficial .risk is imporatnt part of every task .evene if we start walking on road there is a risk of accident but world simply doesnt stop because life has risk of death .moral of the story is successful people try out different trial and errors for the sake of maintaning their success , and sometimes also to offer something new to the community .
