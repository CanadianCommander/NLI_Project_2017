the answer to this question greatly depends on the way one rates succes .if succes is mesured in financial terms by the accumulation of money for instance , then it does seem that innovative and risk taking people have the high hand to being succesful .howerver , if been succesful means living a happy and joyful life , then doing what one does best may be the answer .entrepreneurs who have proven themselves by building florishing businesses , are in most cases daring people that had the courage to try new things and take risks .bill gates , the founder of microsoft , develpped at a young age a passion for computers .with a group of friends , he latter decided to develop an inovative computer software .his company has been the most succeful of the last two decades because its founder had the guts to take a risk , and the will to try something new , a business that did not exist yet .on the other hand , success can come from doing what one knows to do best .people who concentrate on doing their best on what they already know how to do well are often very successful ones .passion for a precise subject can be highly stimulating .by concentrating on what they know to do , people can evolve in an environment much faster than others .moreover , they might reach a more satisfactory way of life by a better balance between their personal and professional lives .therefore , if success is mesured in less material ways , a person with more harmony in his life is more successful .competitiveness and risk taking are probably more rewarding .people who never take risks or decide to discover new things have certainly lesser chances in life .they also risk becoming quite boring people , lost in their routinious lives .personnality is a decisive factor .some people are less adventurous than others , and we are probably for that reason not all equal in front of success .
