i disagree about this question for the following two reasons .first , comunicate with other people is basis for human beings .nowadays , most young people have mobile phone and using it by not calling but mailing .in fact , mailing is useful and easy to send message .but i think mail is difficult to express their feelings .second , i think human beings can not live alone .everyone wants friends to speak of , and anyone loves human beings .a long time ago , there was no mobile phone , tv , and television game .so young people played outside with many friends who live nearby them .it caused their communities .but now , boys and girls play inside because of television game .it is bad for their health and heart .i hope young people play outside .because they are treasure for future .
