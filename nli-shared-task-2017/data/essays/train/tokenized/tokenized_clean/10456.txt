i do agree with the statement .it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having broad knowledge of many academical subjects offers the student to conceptualize a wider range of subjects and information from the world that surrounds them ; students that get broad knowledge , knows where to get whatever information they need under a given situation that might raise in their professional life .students gets during their academic studies , information about bibliography reference , knowing where to look for a broader set of issues than whose specialized for just one thing .the brain can hold a limited quantity of information .from every day s life , we aquire huge quantities of it .when specializing in one specifical subject , if we dont usually practice it in a daily basis , we might tend to forget about important things related to that specifical subject we ve been prepared for .although with broad education , students would tend to forget even more than with specialized education about all the different subjects , they get to conceptualize the most important basics of each .even if specializing into specifical subjects can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological means , substitute activities ) they then become obsolete for working in different areas .we can also add another reason that is ; what if the professional becomes tired of working in the field he academically specialized ? ...would have to get academical studies again in a different professional area !in example of this , if someone whose grade has been into the telecommunications field , and there one day gets tired of working in telecommunications , routers , switchs , commands ! , he or her becomes practically doomed to keep working in that they specialized for , for the rest of his or her days .instead , if the student chooses computer science , there is a much wider range of possibilities .he s able to develop systems in whatever area he wants to work for , including telecommunications !from a social point of view , specializing into one specific subject might lead to isolation .this can happen in ways that the person gets so specialized into something , that knows nothing about the rest of humanity ; gets not much to talk about , or even understand basic fundamentals of different areas .
