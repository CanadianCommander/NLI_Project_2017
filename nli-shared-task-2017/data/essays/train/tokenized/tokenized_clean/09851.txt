i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are two reasons for this ; healthy and changing the life .first of all , young people are more health than older people .if young people feel that they want to climb up the mt , fuji , they can climb up .however , older people could nt .this is because , most older people are bad health .another thing is that they may have not energy to move , so they can not go abroad .they will feel that own country is more confortable than ather countries .second of all , young people have longer life than older people .by trying a lot of things , young people will change their life and the way of thinking .older people are hardly to change the life by trying new things .for example , when young people listen to the music of an artist , they may change the thinkig .then they want to be artist may be .for these reasons , i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
