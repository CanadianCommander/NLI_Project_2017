i disagree with this statement .as a young people myself , i really do not have the feeling to enjoy my life as much as i could .without having any health issues , nor special disabilities that old people might have on a daily basis , i am just so concerned about my future that it does not permit me to appreciate the enjoyment of the life .as a young people , your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsabilities that accompany the life as an adult : a young people has to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the appartment to have a family and to afford for it .this is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment .as an example , most of students do , during their studies , a job or an internship , to have money for some higher studies or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer .in such circumstances , how can they enjoy their lives as students ?they have no time to go to students parties , or they are too much tired . ..besides , most of them are conscious that these years were supposed to be the best , as their parents told them .young people do not enjoy life than older do , and they propbably enjoy it less than older do .although the energy of the youth renders the obstacles of life easier to go through , it is sometimes hard to be young .the only thing that can help a young person to enjoy his present life is to consider that such a life will get better and better .
