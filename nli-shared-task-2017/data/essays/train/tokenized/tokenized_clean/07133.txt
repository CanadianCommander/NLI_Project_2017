i agree with successful people try new things and risks .i have some reasons why i think when successful people try to new things thoes are not professional , weak experience and knowlege about new thing .from thoese points , people have to take risks when they try to new things eventhough they are already successed before .first , he is not a professional about new things .for example , a man who is a really successful restaurant owner .every body wants to open restaurant , like him .he probably has some successful ideas and actions .also , he is sure about his restaurant food and style .it makes him professional owner .however , if he wants to get another shop , such as flower .he likes flower , but it is not enough to open the flower shop .even if he is a successful restaurant , it does nt have a grantee of successful flower shop .second , person who wants to try to new thing does nt have enough experience .as i wrote about the man who is the successful restaurant owener .he ca nt open flower shop easily because he doe nt have lots experience about it .everything is different .for example , when you eat some food , you can realize that every food has different taste .it comes from experience .last , person who wants to try to new thing does nt have enouth experience .the man who i wrote an example is a successful man from his own business .maybe , the he has enough knowlege about it , but he is not get easily .some of knowldge from book , specific person , and so on .but , most important knowlege from own experiece .i mentionedin conclusion , thoese reason which are not professional , weak experience , and knowldege .in my opinion , wherether successful people or not successful people have take risks when they try to new thing .also , we do nt know that successful people can possible to have failed experience .that s why i agree with successfil people try new things and take risks tather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
