i agree with this question .and recently , there are a lot of tour in japan .most japan s tour led by a tour guide .because there are some reasons .first , japanese people likes to go to somewhere with groups and it is safety to go to travel .if tour guide led us everywhere , we do not to think about every one .tour guide thinks about us .for example , how many people are there now ?or next , where do we go and so on .in my experience , i have been to disney land with my friends , and i led my freiends .however it was very hard to led people .it was not easy to it second , tour guide has a lot of knowlege about that place or something .if i had question and asked , tour guide can answer the question .last year , i have been to the china , however i can not speak chinese , so i was in trouble that i missed train , and i called tour guide .and tour guide tell me how to get to ride train and come back hotel .i felt tour guide is very kind .third , it is nesesally to go to travel with tour guide .if i go to foreign country , i do not understand what people say .so it is very bording .tour guide can speak local launguage .what s more , i think tour guide know local imformation .it is very important to enjoy in there .if i go to somewhere myself , i can not to know about local imformation .of course , it is not free when i want to go to anotherplacein summary , i agree to led by tour guide when i go to travel .but it is very safety during travel .and it is important to go to
