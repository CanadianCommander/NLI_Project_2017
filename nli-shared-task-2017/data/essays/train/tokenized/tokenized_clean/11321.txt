i totally agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .firstly , only learning facts is something which is kind of simple .everybody is able to do this .it is not a special feature of students .just learing things by heart is something which you have done in primary school , and of course it is good to do that there but not at highschool or at university .besides it ist not important anymore to know many facts because there are so many books , and of course the internet , where you can search for everything you want to know .secondly , as fast as you can learn facts as fast you will forget them again .so it is much more of interst to learn where you can find them than knowing them in detail .that s why i think it is enough to know the book or the homepage where you can find the information you are looking for than knowing the information .thirdly , learning how to understand ideas and concepts of things will help the students to come along in there life after their studying time .when they will have a job they will not be asked for facts such as how many people live in ohio , but they have to come along with more complex quesions where they have to use their ability to understand the idea and concept of for instance a new project oder product and to combine this knowledge .lastly , it is not only good for the students  job-lifes but also for their private lifes to understand the general idea of things .for example when reading the newspaper it is much more of interest to verify critical statements than learning the exact number of the people who died in the iraq war .so all in all you can see that the ability to understand the gist of things is more relevant than just learning facts .
