in the four-word short maxim , `` no pain no gain ,  contains the tremedous truth which reveals the secret of the successful people in the history .the people who brought progress to the world were those who challenged themselves to new things through the painful situation , and not those who followed the typical rule accepted by the world .columbus took the risk of going to the sea in order to discover a new continent , and the wright brothers , took the risky action of inventing air plane , the best inventory human ever created in the history .trying new things despite high risks and pains are one of the common factors of the successful people .columbus not only took risk of his own life but the risk of hundereds men when he went on the unprecedented trip to the ocean with his followers .people did nt think it possible to discovered the new land , and even those who suspected the existence of continent were nt bold enough to try the risky business .only by trying the new and dangerous business , columbus was able to succeed in acheiving his goal .on the other hand , others who did nt try new things were never able to succeed but only made his success even more special .the wright brothers , who brought a huge progress to human life for inventing air-plane , also took a great risk when they experimented their air-plane .even after their air plane fell and the incident almost took their lives , the brothers did nt hesitate a moment to try again to successfully invent their air plane .most people follow the typical rules accepted by the world ; few people go over the typical rules and make a great acheivement .like columbus and write brothers , only those who go over the boundary of socially accepted and the risk , are the people who change the world , so called successful people .
