the issue of whether young people nowadays contribute enough time to helping their communities is a controversial one .while the observation of the behavior of a few individuals might indicate so , i believe that the opposite is truefirstly , as a native of a underdevelopped country , i was able to observe poverty and felt the need to do something about it .both college and university , i joined a group of students that regularly went to local shanty towns and helped in different ways .something i especially recall from that experience was the fact that whenever i shared this interest with other friends , they also expressed their interest and were , in many cases , willing and able to contribute and help .the same happened to me a few times with adults , but in general this was not the case .i acknowledge the fact that the world of adults has usually stricter time schedules that make these sort of participation more difficult .nevertheless , i believe that eventually one helps other because has an inner desire to do so , and no time constraints are valid excuse .secondly , i would like to correct the perception of young people as selfish individuals , only concerned with their own welfare .i also came across many young acquantainces who were not willing to spend part of their time helping others , but is nt this attitude widespread among adults ?i believe so .indeed , i believe there are two main reasons why people do not help : lack of interest or the belief that participation is useless in the sense that it will not solve the `` real problems  .while many youngs are not interested in helping others , i had the impression that the belief that helping people is useless is not as widespread among youngsters as it is among adults .as a result , young people are more willing to participate whenever they face the opportunity .in this sense , young people are more generous to their communities than their adults counterparts .in conclusion , i believe that many young people are willing to help their communities .the observation of a few who do nt should not led us to believe this common misconception .
