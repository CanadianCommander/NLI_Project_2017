in my opinion , young people already do spend enough time helping their communities .there are at least two kinds of communities they currently can be involved in , one is the parental community , consisting of the family members and the closer friends of the family , sometimes up to the whole village some people live in .the other community is the one where the family usually is not involved in , this can be the colleagues from work , but also communities found on the internet or by creating or simply appraising works of art .some young people nowadays tend to spend more time in the latter , thus leaving the first community behind with a kind of ungrateful feeling .this feeling is a remnant of former days , where people where forced to live together in order to survive and support themselves .nowadays these tasks that used to be distributed among all generations in a family can be transferred to public organs or private institutions .this relieves other parts of the family off their burden , giving them more time to do and produce what they really like .even more , our modern societies practically force people to leave home .people are required to be able to travel for work , or to move to different cities in order to obtain a proper education .the possibility and the need to leave the community in which people grew up in of course weakens this link back home .these young people pay back their former duties to their families or communities by different means .some of them are taxes , which in turn - at least in most of the european countries - are put back into community projects , or specific dwellings for retired people .another , equally important way , is to pay back their duties by creating works of art which can support the whole society .i think by giving the people a choice of what to do with their time is having the biggest impact on the societies , and also communities .the communities profit indirectly from this freedom .i think the impact is a good one , the people who are criticizing this simply have to accomodate to the fact that the ways of feedback are changing .
