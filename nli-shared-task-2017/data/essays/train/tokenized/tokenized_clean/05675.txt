successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with the following statement because success comes with hard work .those who know the taste of hardwork they will try and do more things in life .this can be explained with a very well known example of mr. mittal .he tried new thing like coleberating with the top steel manufacturing company arcelor .initially there are lot of problems arised .they are like competition from other companies and racial abusements etc . .but still because of his hard work he has successful in making his dream true of coleberating arcelor .now it is named as arcelor-mittal steel industry .successful people know how to overcome risks .success in life can not be achieved overnight .success is a hardwork and determination of a person for many years .successful people like taking challenges in life .they will fight for success .successful people like trying out different things in life .they want there name to spred all over .to be a verygood successful person he must have good leadership qualities and ethical principles .we can have many more examples of successful persons .reliance ambani is the most successful person in our country trying out in many forms like cellular , petroleum , steel , etc . .therefore by these examples illusrated above i srongly agree the statement that successful people try new things by facing risks .therefore successful persons always win in life .
