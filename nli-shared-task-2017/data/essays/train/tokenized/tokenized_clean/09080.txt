i think people usually buy products because of attractive advertisement .but most products are worse than sample on the advertisement .therefore , i agree with the topic -- most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first of all , salers always tell customers how great the products are .they can make a magic story to show how products work .for example , one time i went to a cusmetic store , and the clerk told me their product was good , it could make my skin better .after i used it for a week , i did nt think so .it was not useful , and it was very expensive .i was really angry about that .second , advertisement companies know how to design the product and advertisement to attract people .in addition , they know how to persude the customers and make many programs , such as buy one get one , or coupons .for instance , those programs usually attract women and teenagers .but they always regret after they bought those products .third , advertisement companies usually make a survey to understand what kind of products will be popular .and they try to make a perfect product in a reasonable price on the advertisement .when customers see the advertisement , or hear from their friends or co-workers , they will rush to buy without thinking .in my opinion , i usually think twice before i buy something .it is necessary to consider about that .as i have many experiences , i do nt want to waste money on those unuseful things anymore .now , if i really want to buy something , i always ask my friends or look up information on the internet .salers just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantages of their products , and after you bought it , you will find out how terrible it is .therefore , i support the idea -- most products seem better on the advertisement than they really are .
