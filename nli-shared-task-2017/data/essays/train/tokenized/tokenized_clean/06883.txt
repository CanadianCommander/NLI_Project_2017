i disagree the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today for the following reasons .first , cars make people more enjoyable .for example , people can travel to many places by using car .last year , i travel to hokkaido , a north island of japan .hokkaido is so vast that i decided to go around by rent a car .i went a eastan part of the island and see a part of russian island and went up to mountains to see some beautiful landscapes .i had a very good time .i noticed that a car trip has some good point .one is i can go anywhere i want .and second is i can go anytime during mu trip .if i had not use a rent a car , i would not have satisfied like this .as the example shows , cas is necessary for people and there will more cars in the future .second , cars become less harmful to environment because of improving technology .today , there are some kinds of cars which is heartful to environment .for instance , i knew the news that a hybridcar , which is less harmful to the erath , is increasing .i also bought this kind of car because it is good for the earth .thanks to that technology , people can ride cars less harmful to environment .it is the evidence that cars will increase in twenty year .as the example demonstrares , cars will be incrased in the future .in conclusion , i strongly believe that there will be more cars in twenty years than now .
