there are some people saying that there will be more cars in the future than today , because the car is convenient for ourlife and it saves our time .but others say that in the 20 years after there will be small amount of cars than now , because the energy is running out and the car is no more can work .these two opinions are reasonable , but i agree the latter opinion .firstly , there is lesser and lesser petroleum the energy source of car .but those kinds of resources are limited and someday it will be runned out .then , the car can not work any more without constituting the energy source .but within the 20 years it will be impossible to develop and commercialize the new energy sources .secondly , there are many regulations and consensuses about prohibiting the air popplliution .the main source of air pollution is came from the car diving .it will be more and more lessened to use cars all over the worled .thirdly , the traffic is so busy .there are limted roads available which the car can go .but it is overcrowded day by day .as a result , the government construct many different transportation systems , such as railroad , bus , and subways , which reduce the road traffic .in cities , at rush hours , traffic cause many people to waste their time on the road .it results inefficiency to their work and everyday life .in conclusion , in twenty years , the cars will be used little than today .because , there is little resources to run the cars , the car produce much polution which is regulated all over the world , and the traffic is so serious that the people use other transportation systems than choose cars .
