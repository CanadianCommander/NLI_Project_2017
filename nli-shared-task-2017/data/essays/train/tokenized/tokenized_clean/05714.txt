i agree this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for following reasons .most of advertiesments are made of professional computer technition or professional team .and the stuff that advertised is not the only stuff we can get , we might can get better stuff .first of all , most of advertisement of cosmetics attract many women .by using this lotion , many women dream that we can get smooth and soft skin like this model .but the face of models have retouched by computer .so nobody can get the skin that have retouched by computer after all .i spent lots of money for lancom when i was young .and i know i am a victim of this kind of advertisement .second , most of advertisement of food in the restaurant or fast food are better than real products .because when they make sample of food many professional work for that .for example , professional cook , food arrangement adviser , table arrangement adviser and cameraman work for that advertisement .but only part time staffs works in real .third , advertisement of fashionable clothes or shoes are also better than real products .whenever celebrities wear new fashionable clothes , many magazines put that picture on it .and many woman of all over the world try to get same stuffs and that causes higher price .if we can get same stuff , we can find same kind of stuff more cheap price at another place .when i got a bag that cameron diaz has , i realised that .unless we have same style body or color of skin or hair , it does not work for us .in conclusion , i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
