the students in the class room learn abaut ideas and concepts but is better for student learn facts , in my opinion is more important for students learn facts for many reasons : first learn facts is important because the students learn doing the things , because is more easy the students make and dont forget he or she did , for example do or paint a apple the students never forget the color and form the fruit .second the students need understand ideas and concepts but that is easy forget , for example the teacher prepare yor team and explain this , and the students if not study or review then he or she forget .in many cases the students is lazy and arrive the home and forget your books in the room and begin to play them forgot the lesson .third is important learn facts because them learn of your own experience .for example if your theacher it s theaching abaut the resources naturals is better go out the camping and see trees , animals , rivers etc. theaching the importance them the students do nt forget that experience .the is necesary for students learn ideas and concepts but is better learn facts because is more easy remember that .she or he learn doing and do nt forget never that , also learn of your own experience .
