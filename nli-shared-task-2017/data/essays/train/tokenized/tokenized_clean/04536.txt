i agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .is nt that what advertisiments are supposed to do ?to begin with , advertisements and publicity are very strong tools that companies have to make their products know .moreover , they will do anything they can to attrack consumers and influence them to buy more of their products .that s why advertisiments will show them as a unique and esential thing that we shoul all have , implying for example , that if you wa nt to be successful you have to buy the new dell laptop .in many ocassions , products look a lot better in the advertisements than in the stores .for example , it is common to watch a tv advertisement on some brand of trousers and inmediately think you would love to wear them .but then when you get to the store and you see the real thing you sometimes get dissapointed .the situation gets worse when you try them on and confirm what you have already guessed : they look awfull on me .another reason for products to look better than they really are , is that many times , radio and specially television advertisement stars one ore more celebrities or respected members of the community who state that they use a certain product .this gives you the feeling that the product is one of high quality and that it promotes positive values .for example , if tiger woods uses nike golf clubs then they must be the best .or maybe if the prince of wales says he uses dunlop deodorant and he feels satisfied with it , then we will assume the product does nt harm the enviroment .
