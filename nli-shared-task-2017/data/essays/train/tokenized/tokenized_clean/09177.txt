joy of life has diffrent meanings for every and each one of us .many of us think that young people enjoy life more than old people do .i totaly agree with this point for the following reasons : younger people are healthy , they have tasted less pain than older people , and they have less constrains and responsibilities in their lives .first of all , young people enjoy a healthy body , in most cases disease free , which allowes them to participate in many diffrent events .we rarely ever see an old man surfing .also sports world wide is more concerned about young people rather than old .people who are fourty years old and above never have the fitness to compete over sports titles .one the other hand , young people enjoy body fitness .how many times did we see a fifty years old win a race with a twinty years old man ? .secondly , young people have been through less problems than old people , daily life problems does not effect them both the same way .young people do nt usually have problems at work .in addition to that , problems are easy to be forgeten when we are young .young men can easily get over a fight for example .on the other hand older people are more exposed to domistict husbend and wife fights , a man or a women who lives in such a situation can never be as happy as a single young person .lastly , young people are more free , they have less responsibilties .for example , young poeple wo nt have to worry about paying rent .indepdency is another factor .in early age people wo nt have to worry about other family members .on the other hand , old people have many responsibilities that they can not neglect , they have to provide food and shelter to their families , which is another thing young people wo nt have to worry about .at the end , it is easy to notice that life is way easier when we are young .based on my experience , when i was a teenager i enjoyed unlimited amout of fun and happeness , the reason behind that was the free , healthy life and absence of responsibilities .that is why youngsters are happier than old people .
