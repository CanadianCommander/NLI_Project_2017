the the best way to travel does not has to be in a group with a specific tour guide .i have visited many countries with my family and very few of them had been with a tour guide , most of the times , we do research on the country we are going to visit and prefer to get as much information about the touristic places as we can .and we plan our own tour as a family , if we want to make a stop or stay more time in a specific place , we can do it , but we would not be able to do this if we were traveling as a group because we have already a schedule .which we have to respect due to the rest of people we are traveling with .we have also traveled with a group , with friends of the entire family , it is a lot of fun because we share lots of great moments , but even tough , we do not travel with a tour guide , we also plan our own tour before the trip .six years ago , we took a trip to vail colorado with another family , great friends of ours .in total we were 10 people , five from my family and five from their family .we went skying at the vail mountains , even tough my parents , my brothers and i had already skyied , this was a new experience .we enjoyed it that much that i can dare to say that it has been the best trip ever , we got the opportunity to share with the other family as well as we shared with ours .we had such a great time that we made another trip together .this exciting trip made me sure that the best trips are not necessarily with a guide tour by your side .
