today companies need diversity in order to stay competitive in a very rude market whereas student are more and more specialized in a knowledge for example they chose a special course to study marketing or human management .this two fact are contradictory .that s why i am totally agree with this statememt for many reason .have a large knowledge concerning very different subjects give us many benefits .first if student are performant in differents sectors they obtain a good mobility in work .it allows to change lot of time of work for example if you study mangement and maerketing it allows you to first work in advertisment and the in the human ressources .i think it is very important .your work is more exciting .whith general capacities concerning differents activities you will complete your knowledges and you will become more competitiv against other worker with only specialized capacity .you will obtain easily a work qnd will better earn .then in a complex market you have to consider all side of the environment and so you have to improve your general knowledges in order to understand and act well on the market .general information can help you to resolv a problem .a complete foration allows you to best consider a problem .moreover a lack of general knowledge is an important drawback because it reduces the subject of discussion in your allday life .all things you know will be used one time into a speak and so the more knowledge you can learn the more you must learn .the people considered as open-mainded present lot of knowledges .actually they are specialized in a course but they have great knowledgs concerning others subjects .to conclude i cqn say that it is a bad strategie which is used by education .when student are specialized they have a huge lack in general knowledges
