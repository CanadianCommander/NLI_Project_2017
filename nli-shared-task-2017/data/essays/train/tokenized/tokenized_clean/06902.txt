i agree that in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .today fuel price hike and increasing pollution are major problems faced by the world .fuel price hike is one of the major reason that one may discontinue using cars .every one can not afford to pay so much for fuel .one may get a car with the help of various facilities provided by car companies like finance , loans etc but cost of maintainance and overall running cost can be a major problem for a person .day by day every thing is becoming expensive and for one it might be unbearable .also pollution levels in cities are increasing , because of that global temperature is increasing at constant pace .as a solution to this problem goverments of all the countries are now making public transport more stronger which gives one better facilites and cheap transportation .local trains  running on electricity following local network with in the city may help commuters to travel to their desired destination consuming less time .the use of public transport may take some time to be adopted by mass , but it will be successful because it saves time , money and enviroment if considered in broader sense .also the traffic on city roads is increasing because of the craze among the people to buy cars .but soon they will realize and will go for the better option that can be using public transport or even cycles to travel near by destinations .today the number of new cars rolling on roads are incrasing at very fast rate , thus increasing traffic and fuel prices because of increasing demand .with the passage of time one have to think seriously about his pocket and time .hence , because of so many constrains one may not use car .as on one realizes various problems in driving car within the city one may switch on to a better alternative to save money and time .
