it has been a long time disputing issue for which one is more important among student should understanding ideas and students should learn facts .for my view , i think it will depends .you need use different method to study in different time according to different requirements .take studing mathmatics and phisics as an example .as all of you know , mathmatics and phisics are very logical subject and learning them needs very deep understanding of their facts .only after that , you might be able to begin find out some essential of those subjects .for example , if you just have remenbered sping formular , not very understanding the theory and facts of the spring formular , it might be , perhaps , when you facing some relevant problem very easy , you might be able to solve the problem just use the spring formular you have remembered .however , if the problem you are going to face is the combination of different mechanic .you need to figure out effect of combination of mechanic which include spring mechanic area .you could solve the proble only if you know the thorough facts about sping including the reason of spring mechanic , process of spring mechanic , some special circumstance of spring mechanic , etc .nevertheless , if you want to learn cmputer program language and want to just use it for application .you do not need to learn many details which sustain the higher application .only some idears and concepts are enough , since nowadays , some lower level details and facts are integrated to a higher method of computer language .and those integration are the job of another computer experts , who need know facts from how memory comsumering to how to located the memory , etc .you can just think the higher method as a black box , just use it will be ok .so , it will be important to use fiffer
