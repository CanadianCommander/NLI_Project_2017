i m disagree with this statement .there are very differences in young and older people enjoy .the energy in young people can influence in their enjoy for example the young could to dance every night , but it is nt to older people , so they are not enjoy in a party every night .the health is other factor to people enjoy .if i m sick and i wanna to drink beer with some friends , i could not .the mode of enjoy life is determinated how it see the life .if i like the parties but i m older for it , is obvius that i m not enjoy life .but if i like swim in the ecean and i can do it , then i could enjoy life in every moment .the young have their own enjoy , so the older have their own enjoy .i could nt to say this enjoy life more than this other , because their likes are very differents .i think the people that do the things as like them , they enjoy life , it would be young or older , anybody would be very happy .finally , the energy , the health , the likes or dislikes influence in our enjoy .the young people or the older people can enjoy life alround their likes .anybody could enjoy life .when i do the wanted , then i enjoy life .whatever , wherever and whenever i can enjoy life , but it have to like me , i have to can do it , young or older i enjoy life , it is not determinate for the age or for the times .it could be always when you want to do it !
