which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a guide ?i think it depands on where you are traveling to .if i will take a trip in a famous city with several wel-known gardens and lots of special products , i will choose a group led by tour guide .it s convenience to visite the city and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bus and the guide will give many details on the history of the gardens .and the tickets will be cheaper than if i buy them seperately cause those tour guides always have group discount .i might have to buy some products in some perticular tourist stores that the tour guide leeds me into , but i might also get into those stores and get fooled even without a tour guide .do nt laugh at me as that is the realy experience myself in hangzhou .i visited hangzhou 2 months ago all alone .but i took a taxi to longjing moutain where the famous villige producted green tea located and bought some tea in high price just like all tourists did in group .as i would did so anyway , why should nt i join a tour group and travel easily there ?if taking trovel to some places like tibet , i will go without a tour guide .the purpose to such places is to experience how is the life of people there .you will not really experience it if you are in a group .the only way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot .to live as you are one of the local people .how can you really know the live there when a tour bus is waiting for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mates are talking about eveything the see around you ?there is no a best way to travel , but planning what knid of travel you are making and then you can choose if you need to be in a group led by a tour guide .you can always travel in a better way .
