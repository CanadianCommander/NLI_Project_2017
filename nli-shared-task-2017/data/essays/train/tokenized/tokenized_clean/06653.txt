some people belive that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .others belive the best way to travel is on your own .both opinions have its adventages and disadventages actually .i agree with the second opinion .to me , traveling on your own is much better .first of all , when you travel on your own , you are free to go wherever you like .you can design your own tour according to your likings and interests .you can manage your time better .that will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better .another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spendings according to your budget .in a group , the places you will visit are determined by the tour guide , and unfortunately , you can not change it .traveling in a group led by a tour guide costs a certain amount of money , which probably would cost you less if you plan it yourself .you should follow the tour guide and go the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food .for example , my husband and i planned an `` interrail  trip in europe couple years ago .it was all on our own .we planned in advance where , when , how , for how long we would go .it was more fun to explore the places on our own since we hand the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life .we made friends too .as a result , i strongly support the idea of travaling on your own .you have more freedom , you interact with people and you make friends .
