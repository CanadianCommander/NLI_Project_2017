some people say `` broad knowledge of academic subjects are essential .however , i do nt think it s true .the purpose of attending schools is basically for becoming a professional in one field .broad knowledge about other fields is not necessary to become an expert .normally , we learn subjects of various kinds in elementary schools , junior high schools , and high school .however , most of subjects which we learned there are not practical knowledge to live .for example , i studied biology and geology for more than 4 years in my junior high school and high school but i have never used this kind of knowledge to solve problems i encounterd .i am sure that it was waste of time because they are useless .i majored in music composition in my college for 6 years .i received ba and ma from the college .however , i am still studying music composition in an another institution because i thought what i studied in my college was only a small part of entire subject .i am sure that it takes a lot of time to become a real professional in one field so i think all student must concentrate on just one field to become a real expert since we do not have so much time .if you learn several subject , especially in college or university , it normally costs more .if you major in two subjects , for example , fine art and mathematic , you have to pay normally more tuition than students who major only one subject .in addition , you have to buy more books and materials for several subjects .however , you have less chance to become a real professional on both field because you spent less time compared to students who major in only one subject .it does not make any sence .it s just waste of money .broad knowledge is not essential to become an expert .knowledge in other fields is normally useless .besides , it takes time to real expert in one field so you do nt have time to learn other subject .moreover , it s espensive to study more than one subject .
