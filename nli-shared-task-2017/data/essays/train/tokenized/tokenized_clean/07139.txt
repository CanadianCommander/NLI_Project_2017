nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .who are those who spontaneously share their time to help ?what about those who do not help and what are their reasons ?first of all , it is important to determine exactely the zone we would like to focus on .we could consider the north american and french populations even we can not deny the cultural gap .in our western cultures , nowadays people grow up as consumers and within time they tend to be willing to satisfy their evergrowing desire to consume .this behavior reflects the individualism that characterizes the nowadays young people .not only are young people individualist but they are also aware that time is money .the more time you spare , the more money you save !those who spontaneously give enough time to helping their communities are people who consider being fair is essential .a friend of mine used to be volunteer at the j. carter s fundation .she worked with a group of people coming from all over the world and coming from various walks of life .they learnt how to built houses and they spent their whole summer building houses for the poor latin american families who can not afford such comfort .i could also provide the example of a friend who spends every saturday in a pension for elderly people as a volunteer so as to offer them company and sincere attention .i do admire her devotion and the way she is involved in what she believes fair and good .i belong to those who do not give enough time to helping .i sometimes help associations especially in the winter when they need volunteers to serve food to the people in need .but i am aware this is not enough and i could do more .i do agree that lots of people of my age do not give time at all because they do not feel concerned .our generation is deeply rooted in an individualist perspective .my parents  generation has known winter 54  for instance with the great national movement lqunched by the abbe pierre in france .maybe my generation suffers from a lack of such a charismatic spokesman who could be able to gather young people and to channel their conscience and their energy to give more time to helping the communities .
