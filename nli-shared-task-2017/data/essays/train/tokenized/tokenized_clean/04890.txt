ya , i do agree with this statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do wel .most of the well known people who got successe surely went on with lots of risk s .this is because one wont have a special attraction untill he do somthing which is extrodinary .if he/she is success with that new idea , then they will surely be praised .succesas only comes with one who came over lots of hard work and faced lots of hardships .the person who wanted to invent an aeroplane , at first kept there life at risk by flying themselves into air .the shape of that idea is an aeroplane .if they wouldnt have get that creative idea and if they wouldent have implemented that idea one couldnt see an aeroplane at this time .such great invention are to be remembered forever .every individual should have a right goal and should know how to succesed .success play s a vital role in ones personal life .one will have its impact surely in his upcoming carrier .even though there are lots of success stories around us , we maily give our importance to the one which is unique .doing the same old thing may also bring some importance , but as when compared with the success which includes risks and different turns all over its way , its nothing .we have many well known people such as newton , right brothers and so on .these people are well know for ther great inventions due to which we now have the `` law of gravity  , aeroplane , telephone and all .the major aspect of success is hard work , creativity and a good intelectual brain .every person can become an inventor or somthing else only if he/she is studious , very much conserned with his/her ideas , innovative thinking .one should surely try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do to come out with flying colours .
