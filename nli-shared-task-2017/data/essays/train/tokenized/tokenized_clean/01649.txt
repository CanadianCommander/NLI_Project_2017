i disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide .scinse i would rather be alone than do something with others , i wouldnot like to be in a group .first , i would rather go wherever i want with what i feel that time .i love to adventure to the places where i have never been or had never known .tours with some tour guides are generally planned by them .it may prevent me to do something i want .planned things do not suit to me .moreover i am not a very timely person .therefore i am afraid that i would not be able to be on time .second , i like to enjoy by myself , which does not mean i do not like people though .of cause , there are many benefits that as being a member of tour group .the tour guide may explain a lot of infornmation abd details such as what kind of places they are , or these history and what is famous for .i am sure it would greatly help my tour fantastic , but i would rather than find new things by my own .i believe that it is so much exciting and i can enjoy my tour more as discovering .as being in tour group , i might feel like i am watched from other people every time .i might not enjoy much because of this feeling .
