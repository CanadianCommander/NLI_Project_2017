there are arguments about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .i agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do because of current peace , long life time and developed technology .first , recently , there are less war in the world than older days .in particular , in japan , there is no war for recent 60 years .so , children and adults can concentrate on studies or playings with other friends .if there were wars , we could not eat much , sometimes have to go to war , and so on .second , because we have longer life time than older people , we can do much more things in our life time .for example , because we can live to the age of 70s or 80s , we can do another things from 50s , such that we change our jobs or start new hobbies .one reason of long life time is developing of the medical care .for the develiping of the medical care , we have more healthy time .so , we can do more things than older people .finally , there is the dramatic developement of technology recently .i would like to descrive it by example of the knowledge of foriegn countries .current younger people can know more about foriegn countries than older people .the reason of it is that we can go to foriegn country more quicker than before .so , we can have the experiences of foriegn countries .and , because we have more developed tv , we can have more knowledge about foriegn countries .in addition , we can connect with foriegn people easily , because we have e-mail which is new mode of contact with foriegn people .for other technologies , we can enjoy lives , too .in summary , young people can enjoy life than older people do .
