according to the statement `` if it is better to have knowledge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i agree with the the statement to specialize in one specific subject .the reason for this is if we are involved in specific subject then we have very great opportunities in the future .why i disagree with having a broad knowledge of many acedemics is because it will involve you in various different issues and you wont be perfect in any of the subjects , as we know half knowledge is always dangerous .the example why i choose to specialize in one specific subject is , you can become master of that subject , and start with the research orienting to that subject and which will help you in concentrating on one issue rather than many issues and it would end up with a chiotic situation .another reason why i believe to be specialized in one subject is , for example if you are in field of architecture , once you are done with your bachlore degree you would definetly like to do your post graduation in a specific subject , which will model you to become a better architect .for example masters in emergent architecture which is not known in a country like india , and many other countries and construction is boom in this part of country so for us to stand out in this global world we got to be creative and diffferent , the specific subject is not thought in india in a wide range and if we specialize in this particular subject then you stand at top of the world .now let me brief about this subject , it gives various options on the morphogenisis of the module of any plane through various softwares , which creates amazing structure or graphics to the contemperory world .finally i agree with the statement to specialize in one specific subject .
