i agree with this statement .i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i have three reasons .first , recently we use a lot of natural resource .and i think that we have to stop to use that .if we use that like this pace , we will have to use all natural resource in 20 years .natural resource is fewer and fewer , everyday and every year .if we use all natural resource , it must thai we can not live .because , if we can not have resourse , we can not use air controler .i can not live without air controler in summer .japanese summer can not live without air controler !second , i think that a new trafical tool will invite in japan .next twenty years , we will use new trafic tool everyday .the new trafics tools shape is like train , but faster than train and later than plane .third , i think that dokodemo door will come to our world , from animation ( doraemon ) world .if we can use it , our life become very very convenience !and we become that we never use a car .these are the reasons why i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .and i think , we should take care about natural resource .
