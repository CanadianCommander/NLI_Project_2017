personally , i am agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .my point of view depends on two arguments , the first one is that i believe there is no profit without risk .the second one is that repetition of a task or a job turns out to be a routine .the common saying of the business argues that there would be no profit without risk .when opel , the german car manufacturer , first introduced their small car model `` corsa  , many people asked that why someone would purchase small car .but corsa had reached tremendous sales number in all over the world .opel took the risk of producing a small and unusual car and sold millions of corsa all over the world .on the other hand , we can see lots of failure stories about new products , jobs , even marriages etc .the main reason for failure is the involvement of risk and the amount of risk can never be calculated accurately .however , some people prefer to do what he  she already know how to do .personality , culture or economic conditions can be effective for not taking risks .doing the same thing for a long time results in specialisation in any task .however , it also results in repetition of task , in another words , it cretaes a routine .as a result , the dilemma of taking risks or not depends on whether you are a risk takei believe i am a risk taker and would prefer to try new things and to take risks up to some degree in order to be successful in my life .
