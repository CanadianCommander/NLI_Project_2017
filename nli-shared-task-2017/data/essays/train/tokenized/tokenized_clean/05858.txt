i absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are two points that explain my disagreement .the first point are the high costs of a guided trip and the second , more important point are the freedom and the flexibility that one does not have on such a trip .the first reason of my desagreement are the costs .the costs are always an important part in the plannings of my trip .if you chose to travel in a group led by a tour guide , the prize will certainly be higher than if you do the same travel by your own .in a guided group , several people need to get paid for organising and making a trip , for example the people from the office , the bus driver and the tourist guide himself .by going on my own , i save all these costs and can spend the money on something else .the second reason why i disagree with the statement are the freedom and the flexibility .in a guided group of travelers , one has naturally no freedom to do what he or she wants to do .the guide tells the people when to stay somewhere and when to go , when to eat and when to go to the restrooms .when i travel , i want to make my own decisions .i want to have the possibility to eat when i am hungry , to stay at a place as long as i want or to leave it whenever i like to .connected to this freedom is flexibility .on a guided trip , everything is booked and scheduled and there is no chance to change plans during the trip .however , i prefer to be flexible .if i like a place , i want to have the possibility to stay there for longer then i planned .if i travel without guide , i can change my plans whenever i want to and i am opened for knew things .to sum up , i desagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because the costs are normally to high and because it would mean a lack of freedom and flexibility for me if i joined a guided group .
