when it asked which is better , exclusive reading or inclusive reading , however , people rarely come to absolutely consensus at such a controversial issue .some people attach more improtance on the broad knowledge , but as to me , i can not accept the statement state above .because the argument is too extreme .as far as some subjects concerned we need to focus more attention on the specific subject and think it deeper .those more concrete ones like , biotechnology , agriculture , medecne and so on .these subject require more related information about it .subject like medicine need not only aboudant knowledge but also adequate experience .the following example that is a persuasive one .imagine that , what will happen if a doctor focus more attention on economy instead of patient and medical books .the concequence is definitely undesirable .not doubt broad knowledge is very significant to some scholars in specific realm .for instance , some subject , such as those abstract ones , like history , philosophy , politics , administration , archeology need a wide range of knowledge .these sort of scholars expecially in the field of administration , should have more common sense than the other subject , because when face with difficult situation they can make a fast decision base , all these need more comprehensive learning of some knowledge such as history , economy , politics so on and so forth .according to what have been discussed about , i believe this question is depend on personal inclination .
