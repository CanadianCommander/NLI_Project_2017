there are different types of travelers , those who like traveling in group led by a tour guide and the others , more courageous , who like traveling alone .i my opinion , traveling in a group far outweights traveling alone .there are two main reasons why i strongly agree with this statement : you travel peacefully and you do nt have to worry about where you will arrive .travelling is a great experience but sometimes it can be a little bit scary .that why i prefer to travel in a group , indeed you can leave your home more peacefully and enjoy more your trip .furthermore you do nt have to worry about nothing because everything is organized by the tour guide .the other reason why i certainly prefer to travel in a group is because of the tour guide .in a the matter of fact i can be sure that he will already knows the places to visit and for sure the places to avoid .consequently i will not have any bad surprises or bad experiences with the native people met in the new country .in addition the guide tour can explains clearly the culture , the importance of the monuments and the history of the unknown country .in conclusion traveling in a group permits me to avoid the stress due to the trip and to learn more about the country i visit .it is for thess reason i strongly recommend everyon
