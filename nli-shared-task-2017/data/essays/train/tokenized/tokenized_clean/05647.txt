it is well known that the amount of information is increasing exponentially and because the develpment of global and massive comunication technologies such as internet , the avalaiblility of information is increasing too .that is the reason why traditional educational methods must be reconsidered .indeed , it is virtually impossible to aboard knowledge procecess , with only memory-focus aproaches considering the human limitations , and the amount of information available .i think is better to try make the students to learn and understand ideas and concepts rather than try to make them learn a lot of facts .however i consider as necessary fact to give them enough skills for searching and handling information propertly .in addition , students should learn in their classes how to correlate concepts , facts , and ideas in order to develope new conceps .that is the way knowledge and science grow up .the memory can fail some times ( i know that by my own experience ) , but the concepts are always there to help .i think that as an example of what i am saying is the science symposiums and meetings .the speakers just have like twenty minutes or so to talk about their research projects which had taken them several years in most of the cases .so what they do ?they talk about the concepts they studied and they developed .in conclude , i think that the students that have clear their concepts can go on faster in learning precesses .
