i think that in today s world even if a product is of excellent quality and is very useful , it still needs to be advertised in order to reach its sales potential .having said this i completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are couple of main points i want to state here in support of my conclusion .first , there is no way for the consumers to validate the claims being made about a product in advertisement .the only way to figure out if the claims are right is by actually using the product or talking to others who have used the product .the advertiser of the products exploit the dificulty faced by consumers in validation the product related claims , by making claims which have no suppoting evidence .the best example of this is the claims made by many of the weight reduction pills on the market .the advertisements claim that the pills will reduce weight by 50 to 100 ponds in couple of weeks .second point is the fact that the advertisers use well know celebrities to advertise and market bad quality products .just because a is acting in an advertisement for a product does not mean the product is good .most of us know this fact .but association of the celebrity with the product does seem to influence peoples buying decisions .this tells us that even though the product is not of the best quality , the advertisement made it seem good just because it has a celebrity cast .for example in india the superstar actor amitabh bachhan acts in so many advertisements for products which are bad in quality , but just because he is part of the advertisements the products are baught by many people .
