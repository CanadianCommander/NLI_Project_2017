nowadays in our society , most of the people wants to be on the `` safe side of life  .if it is not 100 percent sure they do nt do it , because there could be a risk which they do nt want to take .but is that really the best way , only doing what you already know how to do well ?in my opinion , the answer is no !you have to do risky things to be succesful .for example , if you want to improve in your work life , you have to do tasks which you have nt done already .so , you can show that you do nt want to stay at the same level , but increase your knowledge .this show your bosses that you are commited and have a great loyality .for the student life , in particular , it has to be absolutely normal to try new things or meet some new people .it s not possible to earn a great vage after university , if a student has nt showed great flexibility .a student who get s always great grades can maintain with only studying in his common environment .but when he is ready to take risks and want s to succeed in life he could also go abroad .in an other country he learn s a new language , get in touch with a new culture and meet some new friends .so he can build a network which could be very useful in his life .in my opinion , it is like at the stock market .you can only earn a great benefit , if you are ready to take a risk .if you only invest in blue chips , your chance to obtain a great benefit is much lower as if you put your money in more risky assets .finally , i think all successful people who are working in the business had to do a risky decision in their carreer ( e.g. bill gates , donald trump , josef ackermann , ... )
