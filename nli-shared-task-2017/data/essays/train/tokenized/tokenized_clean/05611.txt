i believe that the young people nowadays are at least trying to give enough time to help their communities .it seems as if we are not helping at all because we do not have enough time in our lives to fully commit a hundred percent of ourselves in the service .however , we can help others little by litte .what are our communities anyway ?are they countries or neighbors ?at least my school , american school in japan , focuses on service to our communities , both countries and neighbors .i recently joined a club in my school called sok sabay , which supports cambodian orphanages to provide home and food supply .it is a non-profit organization and all of our profits that we make as a club goes straight to the shelter in cambodia .we sometimes collect clothes , pencils , toys , and books for children and send them .then we get thanks letters from those children , which is are primary source of our happiness and motivation for commitment in the club .sok sabay is not the only non-profit organization in my school .there are habitat for humanity , phillipine relief organization , and unicef .most of the students join in one of those clubs , and some of them even join in all of them .although we are busy with our lives , we do try to somehow be in part of the service program for other countries .i am also in national honor society , which strongly focuses on service program , especially towards our neighbor communities .we make rice balls for homeless people on the weekends , and visit orphanage shelter about once a month .although it is optional to attend those acitives , most of the members of nhs help willingly .we also support the runnathon acitivity once a year with american club .moreover , we have meetings almost every week to keep in our minds that we are nhs members and it is necessary to think about the issues of service programs .we actively help and support our neighbors .although there are young people who do not care about others at all , i believe that people in my school are different .we know somehow that we should be in part of some services , or at least think about it .i do not believe in necessity of having enough time for service .nothing is enough , therefore , we need to keep reminding ourselves that taking an action worths while .even a little action can help someone , and that is how my school builds the sense of service towards others .
