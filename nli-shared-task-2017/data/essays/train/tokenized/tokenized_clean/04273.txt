some people say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .certainly , many companies spend much money for advertisement because it may have much effects on the sales increase .but , personally , i think many users are getting wiser to find out that many products are not necessarily as good as they are promoted in the advertisements .therefore , i do nt agree that most products seem much better than they really are .my primary reason is that we have become wise to find out whether the products are really good or not despite of the advertisements .recently , we often hear the news that people were deceived by the false advertisements and paid much money for the worthless products .for example , where i lived , japan , cosmetic surgery is very popular among young women generation .however , i have read the article that many women suffered damage by cosmetic surgery although they paid high price for it .many advertisements of cosmetic surgery describe only the good effects and does nt mention the possibility of bad supplementle effects after surgery .as a result of these bad news , women tend to cast a doubt on the advertisements and investigate the hospital enough before paying money .as a result , many private hospitals which provided bad treatment is suffering from the loss of customers .the another reason is that some advertisements exaggerate the products too much and they do nt seem the products much better than they are .for example , in japan , we often see the advertisements of english school or materials for studying english .some of them say that we could master english if we go to school for 10 days .who believes such an advertisement ?i think some advertisement using unrealistic words too much does not look the products well .in conclusion , i do nt think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .we have learned that we should not believe what advertisement says without having a doubt on it .
