in the matter of fact , if people invent a new mean of transportation rather than using the car it could be true .actually , i agree , however , i do not think that in the next twenty years , people are going to get rid of cars , i mean there would be no fewer cars , but on the contrary there would be more cars to use , and the streets are going to be too crowded .because if we consider the expanding population , i mean the growth of people , we will have a great need to have a car for each person to use .car is one of the most important means to move and travel from one place to the another , however , the car needs gas and this would be a problem , if cars increased in the next twenty years .so , in my point of view , if we could think of another mean of transportation to help us moving and fulfiling our needs , this would help to make the street a good environment for people to walk and run if they want .lets say that in the next twenty years there would be no cars , and now i am going to give examples of transportation means people might use to move , for instance ; are people going to use there own legs like the old man did ?or are people going to use hourses and camels or big animals ? .i am sure they are not going to use these means , because the world recently and in the future is becoming more quick , and what i exactly mean by quick is that the time is running too fast , so we have to consider managing our time well and at the same time we have to think of another mean to go from a place to another .eventually , we can not ignore the big importance of cars in ourlives , however , we can reduce their problems by putting alot of solutions .
