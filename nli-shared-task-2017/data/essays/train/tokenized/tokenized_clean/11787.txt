i agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .knowing about different topics is not something that is good only during one s study life , it is good for as long as we as individuals exist .there are situations in which general knowledge is very useful .a way to explain this idea , is with doctors and journalists .it is true that later on their professional life medics specialize in one area in specific , but before that , they go through many fields of medicine until they finally reach the desired one .in my personal experience i ve known many doctors speciallized in different areas of practice and they have been capable of answering or responding accordingly in different situations .the other groups of professionals mentioned earlier , show us that they never confine themselves into only one area .it is true that along their career they have the tendency to follow one field , but it is a fact that have to know about other things too .some newspapers have specialized journalist but when they work on shifts , they have to be able to handle every kind of information that shows up , otherwise , there would be an awful lot lost of information .nowadays , during job interviews , many companies ask their applicants their opinion on different matters and subjects not related to the posting they are applying for .they do this in order to ackonwledge how well prepared they are , and to measure the level of literacy the personel has .this is a situation that supports the idea expressed at the beggining of this essay .just for the fact that everyday we meet and talk to different people , we see and know for sure that we all have a varied diversity of opinions , this is something that is for our own benefit , so for all these reasons and examples stated before , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
