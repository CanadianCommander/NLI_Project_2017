this is the age of modern science and technology .so there will be many changes taking place with in our world in the near future .while some set of the students disagree with the given statement and others do not .i agree with the following statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewers cars in use than there are today  due to the following reasons .nowadays the population is growing a bit faster than the past .due to this growth of population in a limited area like our earth , so there will be automatically a rise in the use of vehicles for their transportation .for example nowadays privacy is considered as the major element .due to this reason people are preferring for buying cars than using public transport like buses , taxis etc .the scientists are in search for possible solutions for solving these problems and also humans are also concerned about the growing pollution mainly smoke pollution .they were trying to reduce this pollution and traffic problems by inventing cars which will not cause any smoke pollution .for example , they invented some sort of hydrogen as fuel in place of petrol in order to reduce the smoke pollution .in order to reduce the traffic problems they are ought to invent space cars which will ply in the air instead of on the road .this will surely reduce the traffic jams .mainly people are concerned about their health nowadays .they think that their health will get spoiled if they are exposed to such sort of pollutions .so they are also in a great need to reduce pollutions and traffic jams .so in the near future there may not be any cars and there may be only space cars which will ply in the atmosphere rather than on the road .and due to their great concern about their health they will prefer to walk and ride bicycles for reaching their offices .for example , in developed countries like japan and china , people already began to use bicycles and walk to reach their offices , schools and any other work they wanteded to do .they believe that it not only reduces the pollutions and traffic jams but also makes them healthy by reducing obesity problems .from the discussions made in the passage , we can come to a conclusion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
