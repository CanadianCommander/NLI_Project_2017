do young people really enjoy life more than older people do ?generally spoken , probably not many would refute the statement , that younger people enjoy life more than the elder .this essay tries to come up with some theories about the reasons for this common oppinion .first of all , every old person happened to be young once .this means they probably partied , travelled , hang around with friends , laughed , joked , went to the public pool , and did everything else what ( young ) one would identify as `` enjoying life  .as they became older , the preferences of `` enjoying  changed continually .maybe they founded a family and got children or the started a successful carrer .they surely had pleasure with this part of their lives as well .as they became old , they retired from their jobs and their children were young women and men themselves .once again their side of view about `` enjoying life  changed .they now have time to collect stamps , reading books , spending time with their grandchildren , and so on .one would say , they became wize and settled down .they look back on their lives and enjoy what they achieved .of course these are examples of lucky and happy people .there are also many retired who sit all they in some pubs and get drunk .as well there are many young ones behaving rather `` boring  compared to others .but these are rather the exceptions to the rule .these statements clearly point out that it is very difficult and probably not consistent to compare the joy of life between young and old .first , it is hard to find a possible definition of what `` enjoying life  means .second , there is an existence of a kind of conflict between the views of the generations themselves about the meaning of `` enjoying life  .there is no way for a fair comparability between the joy of life of the two positions , old and young .therefore i conclude with the statement that both young and old enjoy their lives equally strong , but in a very different way .while the young ones have an urge to express themselves and show their way of enjoying , the elder enjoy more for themselves , intristic and quiet .
