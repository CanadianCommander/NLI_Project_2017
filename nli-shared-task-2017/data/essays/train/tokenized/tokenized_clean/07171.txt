of course i completely suuport the idea that most advertisements make products seem much much better than they really are .let me talk about an experience of myself , i have followed the adeverements many time in making decisions and after that i found that i was mistaking .for examples , i watched on the television about a new kitchen tools which was very nice and very cheap .in that time particulary i was preparing my apartement and i was looking for such things .in the first i thought it was very nice but after buying it i found it was a big mistake to buy it because it spent onle one week and after that it completely destructed .another thing which happen to me while i was looking for a insurance company for my new car , i red an announcement about a new insurance company , that advertisment was like a dream , it said that if any small thing happened to your car it will be fixed totally free , and if the car is completely destructed , you will have a new car , when i red it i decided that i will join this company to insure on my car , after one year of joining that company and paying all my money , i made an acciedent with my car , and when i went to the insurance company , i was astonished to hear that i would not get any money because i was mistaken .another one more thing , when i was look for a nice place to spend my honey mool there with my new wife i heared about a new tourism company .i went to it and i asked them for a nice place to go and they advised me to go for a certain place .but when i went there i found that every thing is very bad .so that i think that one should not follow the advertisements when shearching for any thing because many companies try to sell its bad products by making a very incorret advertisements and they pay atremendous amount of money in it and spend alot of money to make it looks like what we see .
