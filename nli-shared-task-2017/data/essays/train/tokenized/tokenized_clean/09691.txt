i agree with this statement without any doubts .it is sure that without any advertisement a product would not probably be known , considered and , as a result , sold .but it is always necessary to consider the limits between use and abuse and to be really careful with the public you are talking to .or better , i think that people working to make a product wonderful , or simply desiderable , know very well how weak we can be , depending on our age and on our emotional state .and the problem is that they profite of this .here are some examples .if you are a child why not to have the best video-game , may be the last one presented on tv by the world champion video-game player ?and if you are a teenager , a girl looking for his prince , why not to buy the body parfum showed by a beautiful heart breakear ?then , if you are fatty , why not to buy the lower calories food of the most famous mark , even if it is twice more expensive than a normal one ?and when you are getting older . ..woul not you buy the long life skin lotion ?it is quite sad , on my opinion , that we could be so unconsciously controlled by our material needs .now my question is : could my life be so different if , instead of buying those products , i will have some equals but less expensive ones , which do nt include the high price of advertisements ?i can be sure of not .but the paradox is that me too i constantly fall down in these traps : someteimes , a pair of shoes for example , it is not so important , but i totally did wrong when i booked a holiday with a famous travel agency telling about the amazing life in tunisia , in fact i did nt enjoy at all that holiday , and it cost me more than the same travel with an other agency , probably more sincere and less promising .so to be careful of what is presented to us is a good start .then to look for essen
