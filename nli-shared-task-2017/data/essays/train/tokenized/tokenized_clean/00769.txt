i agree with the opinion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learnig facts for them .i will explain the three reasons .first , i think understanding concepts is basic .you ca nt build a high building without rock as a basis even though you may build a short block like a house on the sands .if you learn the facts without accurate concept , you may hear you are smart at first .but eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of thr fact will collase .second , i think you should experience the proper process .everything has an order in process .understanding concepts is a start .so you ca nt understand further facts without them .if you skip something , you will meet the trouble in the end .speaking again , if you ignore the process of understanding accuratly , you will find you did nt know even a easy thing .third , you should undersand the academic thing as a whole .all the thories and facts link together .you should understand something through another thing .if you learn facts separately , it seems like you see the tree but ca nt see the forest .so i think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .a pile of there is no meaning without basic understanding .
