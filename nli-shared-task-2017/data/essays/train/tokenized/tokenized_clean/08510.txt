did the young generation really forget their dues to their communities ?are we really that selfcentered ?i tend to say that we are definitely not and that it is the image that is reflected by a minority of people who do nt care about others .first of all , i d like to say that - working in a hospital myself - i have seen many young people takeing care of the older generations .in fact , and this is what stroke me most , when i started working there , a great majority of the staff is made of pleople under thirty years of age .they all seem to give the best they can in any situation .this is why i ca nt stab them in the back , pretending that we are nt helping our communities anymore .secondly , i basically think - as i wrote at the beginning - that this image is has been created by some people , who , in fact , do nt care about their communities .but is it really only their fault ?no it s not .the way pleople act , stronly depends on the education they got from their parents and on the environement , the conditions in which they have grown to the persons they are today .on balance , i refuse to think , that all young people are that selfcentered as the question lets us thin .while some may not help , other still do .we do nt have the right to put all eggs in the same basket .
