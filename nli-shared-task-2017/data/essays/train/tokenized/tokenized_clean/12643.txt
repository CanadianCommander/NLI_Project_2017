to answer this question , i will organize in two parts .the first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people , and ( even if i m not so old ) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than youngers .we all remember the first time , the first time we made love , the first time we went to highschool , the first time we smoked a cigarette .i think this is one of the reasons we might say younger can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders , just because everything they do is knew .teenage is the period where you hqve lots of experiences , it s an adventure , you discover all the time .i remember my teenage .it was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i ve experienced during this period .i was always going to partys , when i was 15 me and my freind would go to night club and everything has a important impact on me because it was knew .an other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they do nt have money problems , or job problems or even children problem , there parents take care of everything so they do nt have to worry about all those things that makes life difficult .but in contradiction with all that i said before , i would point that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way .adults have a larger experience witch gives them a knoweledge young people do nt have .having this experience they can appreciate things young people woud nt even care about .it s hard for me to give exemples because i do nt consider myself as an complete adult .but maybe adult can enjoy very infime things like a good glass of an old wiskey for exemple .one day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like .i think old people , as they know more about life , can enjoy it even more .on more point is that young people do nt have the time to establish important projects .what is life about after all ?i think life is about being happy and making such as wonderfull things as children .adults have the oppurunity to live this kind of wonderfull projects .they have the opportunity to make plans .the plan of creating a society , the plan of creating a family .
