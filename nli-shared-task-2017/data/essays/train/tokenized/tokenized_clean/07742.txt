i neither agree nor disagree with the point suggested above .i believe that the success can be obtained by trying new things as well as practicing what is already known to us .things that are already known might not be as refreshing and exciting as new technologies or knowledges , but they re still important , because you can not do anything advanced without learning the old things correctly .for example , let s say that i m a member of a medical research group that is trying to develop a new type of medicine for brain cancer .even if the point is ` trying to find a new way ,  you can not perform the task successfully unless you know and perform the previous things very well .that is , in order to develop the new medicine , you have to learn all the previously accumulated knowledges about medicines and brain cancer first .at the same time , however , new technologies and trials are certainly shortcut to the success .many people who had denied the stereotypes and tried new things had succeeded and become a billionair .and that is indeed how our history had advanced so far .people have tried new ideas , knowledges , vogues , systems , and so forth , and up to now we ve become a highly industrialized world .even only 3 or 4 hundred years ago , our life used to be all about church and work .but things get changed and changed .and if those new things have nt been tried , our world must have been stagnated and still .and that rule applies to an individual as well .as long as you stick to the old topic , you can not go forth .history has proved that for you .so my whole point is that the success can be obtained only when you respect the already known things and new things equally .neither old things nor new things can exist without the other .old things exist to be used and to be replaced by new things .but without the accumulated history , new things can not come into its place .
