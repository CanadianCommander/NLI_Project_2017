i disagree to the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .because you can not be free if you are in a group , also there is less chance to interact with the people of the place you visit and you can not explore things by yourself .first , people want to travel to be free from their ordinary lives such as time limits and rules .however , if you are in a travel group , there will be more rule to follow and time limits than travelling by yourself .for example , you probably not be able to spend much time where you want to stay long and always have to be on time to get together with other people .i would be stressed if i have not much freedom during the travel .second , you will get to meet more native people where you visit if you travel on your own than travel with a group .one of the most important reasons to travel is meeting other people from other world .however , if you are with a travel group , you only get to hang out with that group until you come back home not knowing how the people you visit are like .therefore , i would travel on my own to get to know the people from the places i visit .third , you will not be able to explore things by yourself .you can make much memories if you deal with new things from the new places by yourself .if you only follow the leaders of the group you would not feel pleasure of achievement during the trip .in sum , i prefer travelling on my own to travelling in a group due to the less freedom when you are in a group , lack of chances to meet native people from other world and losing chances to explore things in the new places .you will be filled with lots of stories if you travel on your own .
