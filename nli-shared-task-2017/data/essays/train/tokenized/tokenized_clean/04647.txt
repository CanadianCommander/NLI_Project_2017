i agree that it is more important for students to understand abstract ideas and concepts , because their college education should give them a sound base of knowledge and not a mass of unrelated facts .most students want to work at a company after they graduate .if they had only learned facts in college there is the possibilty that they wo nt need most of these facts .the college can not teach all of the diverse facts that are needed for a student to be an efficient worker .it would be better for him to learn concepts in college and learn many facts later , when he needs them for his work .so , when you study electronics , and you learned every fact about building personal computers , and later came to a factory that builds car computers , most of the facts you learned may be useless , but the concepts of creating a computer in general may come in very handy .furthermore students who know the concepts and ideas can connect and thus better understand all the facts they may learn later on because they know how everything is related .for example , if a student with business major only learned facts about , say , germany , and not the concept that stands behind those facts , he might never be able to fully understand them , or to see that facts he learned about brazil can be compared to them .another argument is that facts can be easily accessed through a book or even the internet just at the time they are needed .it would take much more time or even be impossible , to `` understand  an concept just when needed .the student probably would nt even know which concept ist needed , because he would not be able to see the larger picture .for example , if a biology student in america has the task to build a fish tank with exotic fish , and he had learned what `` normal  fish need , and how a fish tank works in college , he could just look up the differences between exotic and `` normal  fish on the internet , or ask a colleague .if , on the other hand , he had no clue about the complex workings in a fishtank , he might not be able to complete his task at all .of course studying human anatomy or history may require more learning of facts than other sciences , like mathematics .but i think that the advantages of learning concepts and ideas much overweight the advantages of learning facts in general .
