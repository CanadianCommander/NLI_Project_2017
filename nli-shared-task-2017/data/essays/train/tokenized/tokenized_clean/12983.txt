most advertisements make a product seem much better that they really are .and there is a reson why companies do that .that reason is that with more buyers a product has , the more proffits they are going to make .producers are always looking for ways to attract more users of the product , and they do so by attracting people with adds that often might not reflect the truth about a product .firstable , in most of the commercials it appears that the person using the product is happier and is leaving an easier life than the one who does not use it .for example ; in an add used by toyota , the person driving the toyota could have a more pleasant trip and get to places faster .and they show people in the street jeoulus and their cars seemed to be less effective .then we have the ads where only joung and beautiful people appear .beer add can be a perfect example of these ; because they are often shown whith girls in a bikinis and guys at a party .this can measlead a persons thinking , and make them believe that drinking that kind of beer is going to make them feel goos and look `` cool  in front of other people .we know beer does nt make you more beautiful and cool it just makes you drunk ! .finally , adds never show the negatives effect of using a product .in a cocacola add you are never going to see people getting fat or people showing a lot of cellulite on their boddies .and there are the true long-term effect of drinking sodas .you just see families and joung people having fun and saying taht cocacola is the best drink ever .in conclusion , we don s have to believe everything we see .and to prevent being fooled by some attractive add , we must keep in mind that most companies are not tryinh to give us a better life , the are just trying to increase their proffits by making ud believe the product is right for us .we need to be informed and make our desicions based on our other options and what is more convinient , not based on what an add says .
