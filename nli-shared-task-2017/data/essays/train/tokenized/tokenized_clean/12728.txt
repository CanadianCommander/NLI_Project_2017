most adverisement make prodcuts seem much better than really arethis is a theme that is always in the spotlight , and is always so controversial , that create always the same questions .what could happen if the market when they are promoting products or services be as they are in real life , no fantasies , no like gold , that eventually marketing do that to their products ? .like they were , new the only thing that has nt reach the market .well when people asked me about my opinion of this , i think a great idea to put your prodcuts like there is nothing like them .because thats the reason they are selling .and if we do nt do it , i bet a lot of sellings of some products will come down just right away .because in the other hand we have prodcuts that does nt need that publicity , since is a basic product , and no matter what you do nt is going to keep selling .i know that not the best thing to do , some people just felt terrible went something is underneath their expectations , just make you feel like it was nt worth it .that your money is value .and to lie or play with your mind is just does nt feel right .in my personal opinion i feel angry , and just want to takeit back .but that the point of marketing and publicity , and those advertisement tehy put on the streets and meka you feel that sensation to own one of those .the main point of marketing is to grow up the sellings , and if that what they need to do , is valid , they are not making nothing illegal .maybe may though of this , with agreing with the advertisements , is that some day in the future a would like to have my own company , and is i need to use that kind of cheat , i will use it without a questioned .
