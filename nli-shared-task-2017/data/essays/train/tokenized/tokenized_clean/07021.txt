in my opinion this statement is right .i think if you always do the same things , that you have done since years you have to work harder to succeed .this work becomes boring and you can not imagine changing anything if you always do the same thing .for instance , if you always work in a company checking cars , this can become very boring and monoton even if you earn a lot of money , work hard and you do your job well .but one day you will feel senseless and hopeless for a better future .if you do not risk or better take the chance and apply for an other job , there will never be any improvment of your situation .in this situation , success will be denied .you will never get a better job with better conditions .in this situation you should change your point of view and try new things .with an application you could get a job with better conditions .but you have to risk that the earning can also be lower .this fact brings me to my point of view .in general , it is better to take risks .if you are felixible and try new things you have the opportunity to alternate your work and even improve it .these changes leads to new ideas and point of views , which can have positive impact on the work and especially on the personality .as an example i can mention students who do not want to go abroad but can be convinced , that it is good for themselves as a person and for their curriculum vitae .this can be called personal success .going abroad means to take the risk of being alone at the beginning , of starting a new life in a foreign country and even of speaking a foreign language .this way they have to learn self-reliance and become more self-confident .these values can lead to success in application in big companies .this access can bring them to richness and satisfaction , which can be experienced as success .people who stayed at home studying well with gaining the best grades will probably not be as sucessfull as people being abroad .i think this is very convincing for the rightness of the statement .
