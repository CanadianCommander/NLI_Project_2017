on a first glance it may sound politically correct to say that it is better to have a broader perspective on many subjects rather than specializing in a field .but i feel that it is better to specialize in a field , though a field that interests the person to a great extent .in olden days when there was no technology to aid the humans , they accumulated whatever information they had on a particular field .but ultimately the information was not massive .that is , the information was not of that quantum that it was difficult for the brain to remember .lets looks at todays picture .we know of the advances made in every field of academics .there is so much to learn and know , but is the human brain capable of that ?i dont think so .so it is actually a human shortcoming .now , from another point of view .the most common example of a doctor !we all know that specialists are an absolute essentiality these days .the reason for an improved life longevity is not only the machines ( i.e. technology ) but also humans in the form of specialists .as a specialist knows his field very well he can deal with almost all the situations arising from his field and this ultimately means greater services to the people .although people tend to argue that due to so many branches in every field it might become a case of `` too many cooks spoil the broth  .but , because to the special fields , the specialist may concentrate more on his field and and work hard to improve his field of work , that is again , better results !we have many such examples in every field today .for example , had every engineer been building bridges and houses ( like earlier ) , would there be fields of engineering such as robotics and nano particles ?but , finally as an exception , it must be left to the individual concerned .this is because there is a natural tendency in some people to learn everything they like , they are inquisitive .so it is better to leave the choice to such people .of course , ultimately knowledge is also for pleasure and self contentment !in conclusion , i would say that the need of the hour is specialists in all walks of life for a better tomorrow .
