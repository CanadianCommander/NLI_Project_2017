i agree with the following statement .there are some young people who would volunteer to work for his or her communities , but the number of young people who would not give enough time to helping their communities is increasing faster .the first reason that more young people would not help for the communities is that there are many ways to spend your spare time .you can play games , play sports , watch television , or do whatever you want to .quite a number of people especially like to play computer games , and watch television .a few months ago , i have read an article about this problem .it showed that the percentage of watching television and playing games has increased after the law of working 5 days a week has been put into the reality .so , instead of wasting time on games and televisions , we should try to help our communities .second of all , we have to study hard for our future .nowadays , there are hardly any jobs that you can get .in order to survive in this cruel society , you have to study , study , and study and graduate collage with a degree .then , it would be easier for you to get a job .the pressure of studying does not give you any free time to helping your community .there should be some change in the curriculum of teaching and studying .furthermore , many things have changed from past .it also made people to change .hundreds of years ago , our ancestors would have helped each other out when they are put in a hard situation .but these days , people think only about themselves , instead of working as a group , as friends .this is an improtant thing that we should learn from our ancestors .young people have strong powers and intelligent brains .but they are using it on things that are not important .helping communities will out our communities to grow to be a better place to live .
