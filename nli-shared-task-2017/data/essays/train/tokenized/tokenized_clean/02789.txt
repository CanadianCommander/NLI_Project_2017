is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?i strongly agree with the statement for three reasons .understanding ideas and concepts is important for development of students  ability to apply , to care for others , and also to come up with questions and theories .first of all , without ideas and concepts , students can not use the knowledge in daily life .for example , let s say there is a boy who has learned the pythagorian theorem but has never been taught how the mathematicians came to the theorem .he does not know where and how the facts came from , therefore is unable to apply his knowledge for some similar but different problems .secondly , i believe that the sense of moral issues can only be developed through vast knowledge of ideas and concepts .to understand how people act , students have to know ideas and concepts about human mind rather than facts , because everyone is different .if students are taught moral issues as facts , not as concepts , they will likely to stick with that idea and not able to think of other people .the last and probably the most important reason is that understanding ideas and concepts well may lead the students to develop with further questions and theories .knowing where and how a fact comes from gives the students better understanding about the fact .moreover , further investigation using concepts will lead some of them to find facts that have never been discovered .development of theories is definitely due to well-understanding of ideas and concepts .some adults , even the teachers , insist the students learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts .i strongly oppose to that opinion .as i stated , understanding ideas and concepts result in students  ability to apply knowledge , to understand moral issues , and to come up with questions and theories .
