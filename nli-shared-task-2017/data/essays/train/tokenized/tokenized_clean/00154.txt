the question whether traveling in an organized tour with a guide is an enjoyable enterprise depends very much on the travel destination , the personal travel companions , and the physical fitness required for a certain trip .if i wanted to go to a destination , where i do not speak the language , do nt know the local customs or where there are specific regions to avoid , due to , e.g. , civil unrest , i would prefer traveling in a group .the protection of a larger amount of people and a , hopefully , well informed and capable guide can make the journey much safer and more enjoyable .also , if i would want to travel with someone who needs a certain degree of comfort and protection , such as an aging parent , a group might be a good idea .and then there is of course the company and ease a group can provide when you travel either alone or with a difficult companion , because there are always people to share your thoughts and feelings with .however , a group can never offer the sense of adventure and indepedence an individually organized trip can infuse you with .also , it may be much more exciting , pure , and romantic to see new places without the filter of the group experience and opinion , and the pre-determined judgements a travel guide may confront you with .would nt it be wonderful to visit a buddhist termple alone or with your best friend or your spouse in the moonlight , to see the golden buddha gleam , and feel close to the spiritual world ?imagine how disruptive the chatter of a group or the insistent lectures of a guide could be in such a moment .all in all , the decision whether to travel with a group or alone depends on a whole number of factors and expectations , and the success and enjoyment of a journey can certainly already be decided by this initial choice .
