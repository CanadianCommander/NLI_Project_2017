i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject .first of all it is true that you have to have many academic than one specific subject , because if you only have one specific subject you might get bored and you wo nt get well on it , but if you have many academic subjects if you are bored on that you can go to the next one .so in my point of view it is better to have many academic subjects .if you have many academic subjects you can learn lots of things that you might not hear of it , and give chances to people that have nt heard or know about it .or one day you can have your own job and you thought of helping people to learn somehting new that they have nt heard about it .i think broad knowledge is what you need in your life without it you wo nt learn something new .if you learnt one specific subject it wont be fun because in the other subjects there are something new that you have nt knew about it .for example in your specific subject you choosed maths but you really liked history and you really wanted to know something in the past what will you do ?so in my point of view it is better to have many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .broad knowledge can be fun by learning something new or they might tell you to go abroad and experience something that they have told you , it will be fun because your in abroad and you will learn something on your own .so in my opinion go for the many academic subjects , believe me you will learn something new that you have nt learned .
