the main issue graduate students face just after their studies is the choice between gaining a more broad view of the business world or specializing in a particular field with academic studies .the real problem is that in the real business world we must be ready to face different choices , and we need a broad knowledge of many different subjects .therefore , gaining experience and knowledge on different fields by studying different subjects and working for different companies can give a competitive advantage , that can be described as flexibility .the second solution , on the other hand , is important because a deep knowledge of a particular subject can result in a competitive advantage as well , that can be described as non-sostitutability .both arguments seem to be contradictory , but taken together can result in greater opportunities in the the corporate world .i would say that essentially both are relevant : a worker with a very broad knowledge of many different subjects will find several opportunities in many companies , but his/her limited specific knowledge on a particular matter may result in being overcome by more skilled colleagues .a specialized worker can be considered as an asset , but as his/her specialization goes out of business , the worker will not be able to suit new roles .this can be considered as a lock-in effect .let s consider , as an example , the internet era : with the new e-commerce some managers with a broad knowledge of different fields could exploit that opportunity , resulting in successful strategic choices .very skilled managers with a very focused knowledge , let s say just on a standardized pipe line , could not exploit the internet era opportunity due to the fact they were missing some crucial skills .at the same time , a very specialized worker like an electrical engineer will have an advantage when his skills are particularly requested in a particular sector .with the internet era , a lot of computer engineers found several opportunities .in conclusion , i think that in order to be a skilled and successful worker , a person should have a broad knowledge basis on many different academic subjects , and a specialization in the particular field where he/she is interested in working in .
