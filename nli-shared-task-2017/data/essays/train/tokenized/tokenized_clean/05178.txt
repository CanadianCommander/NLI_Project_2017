i agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .many companies need to sell their products as many as they could .this is the main goal for each of the companies .in order to be successed , they need to make people to know about the products .one of the ways to let peple find out about products is the advertisments .some times , people do not like the advertisments because they make products seem way much better than they really are .and i think , it is true that many of companies make the advertisment a little bit different than the real products .the companies need to catch people s attention toward their products , so they have to make the advertisements of thier products really good .if people try a new product becasue of excellent advertisement and the product is really good as the advertisement that they saw ; it is good for both of them .however , the producer should not make the low quality of products and spread non-sensed of the advertisement to just make people get interested and buy the products .also the reason why the companies are making the advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is because they have confidence and pride of their products .the companies are really willing to people to buy thier products .moreover , it is kind of the competetion between company and another .usually people are noticed about new product by the advertisements , so the company which makes better advertisement , the chance of selling more products is higher than others .to conclude , some times many of companies make unrealistic advertisement , but it is the right way to run a bussiness .in order to survive in the tough society , they can only make the advertisement extremely good .
