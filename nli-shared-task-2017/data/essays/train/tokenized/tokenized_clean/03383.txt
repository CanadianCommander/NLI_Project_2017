before to start with my opinion of the topic i must to say that in this life what is the much important thing of a product ?so if we want to responde about this question we can tell that the image of a product it s very important but it s only a vision fact .so i agree with the topic .the advertisements make products seem a good image , so the people are involved to buy these .they show us the best quality of products and not the reality .an example is if you want buy a car you see that this car is the best for speed , or elegance , or horse power , or other characterists but you do nt see what is the consume , if the power of this car is economicaly good .but the advertisments are in all our life , becouse if you watch tv shows or programs there are many break of advertisements , if you read a newspaper there are pages and pages of advertisements , when you go to work or only you go out in the streets you can see more and more advertisements .so they are a subliminar message .and the power of its is that can seem products better than really are .however , the advertisements are most important for the economy because a good advertisements can make some profit for the industries .but the buyers have one thing from their side , that the product is much far from reality they ca nt buy it .in conclusion i m in accord at the topic but i tell to all the people of the world that not are impressionate for the apperance of an advertisement but see the really quality of products , that we can change something in the world .
