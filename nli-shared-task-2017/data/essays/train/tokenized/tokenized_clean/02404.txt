it is commonly stated the the only part of the human life when you can enjoy yourself is when you are young , and several writers and philosophers wrote about that topics : actually i do nt agree with this statement for two main reasons .in the first place , asd they feel to have plenty of time , young people usually can waste their time in something that later can reveal as something trivialor not worth doing .i remember having spent entire days watching tv , alone in my room , rather than going out with my friends for a walk , or to have refused to practicee a sport just because i was too lazy .now that i m busy and i do nt have spare time , i really feel as i had waste my time .on the other side , young people have to think seriously about their future , and in many cases , in order to accomplish their objectives , they can not waste time or money to enjoy life .for example , if you are studying at university and want to have good results , you have to sacrifice your time to study , or , even if you have plenty of time , you do nt have the money to enjoy yourself .if you want to marry , you have to save money and this means that you have to sacrifice many pleasures of life .on the contrary , older people can frrely enjoy their life : at the present time , while i m busy studying in order to enter in my phd program , my parents are travelling around the world with their friends and enjoying their hobbies .i think they are really enjoying their life , not only beacuse they have gained , after years of sacrifices , the time and money to do it , but also because they have the capacity to recognize the things that the really can make their life pleasant and worth being lived .consequently , they are able to place everything the right dimension .i think it is possible to gain this capacity only with experienceand in some way , both young people wasting time and young peolple sacrifying themselves for the future can later become able to fully enjoy the life .
