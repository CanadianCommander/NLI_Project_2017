i disagree with the statement .there will be moer cars instead .the most important reason is the unstoppable economic growth in the underdeveloped world , china and indis in particula .when you consider the prospective of their economies and the quantity of their population , all the other negative factors seem to be overwhelmed .of course , there will be ups and downs in their economic growth .however , even a small persentage of car ownerships in the two countries means emmense number of the cars in the world .secondly , considering the duarability of present cars will allows large portions of cars in use now survive in twenty years .you can see this from the fact that in many under-developed contries , many used cars are still use for people s daily purposes .on top of these old cars , more cars will surely be prodused .the third reason is the peoples tendensy to stick to the old habit .or way of living .once you acquired the habit of driving a car around , unless you are force to quit it legally or economically , you wo nt cahnge the habit .in the developed contries where many people arre now driving cars .such regulations or drastic economic dicline are unlikly .the forth point is rather tricky .the statement is not specific about the type of car it means .therfore i would like to include new types of cars such as electric cars or etanor-engind cars .with these new technology , the duration of `` car  will survive at least nore than twenty years .
