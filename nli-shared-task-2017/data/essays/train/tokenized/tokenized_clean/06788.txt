in my opinion most of the young people enjoy life more than older people do .most young people are free in thinking and do not worry about their future as much as older people .they just live their life as it comes and enjoy every minute , while playing with other kids .older people , on the other hand , mostly worry much about their future or the future of their kids and it is hard for them not to think of the future and the dangerous sites of what their actions .they worry so much about a point that they can not just enjoy life and the stuff they do .because of their background and the bad things that might have happened in their past , they see new situations from an different ankle , and avoid them , instead of improving new things and new ways of life .there are many problems , such as money , job , or the comments of other people , that young people do not care about , because someone else ( mostly their parents ) worry for them .living in a society does envolve a lot of difficulties , that young poeple when there is someone they like , they play together , even if there are different barriers like a different language .i think young people are more open to new things and new people , which is an important fact of enjoying life .but not everyone is the same .there are older people who do not fear any situation and enjoy their life to an high age , just like young children , are open to every new step in their life and to every new person .they do not miss any opportunity of exploring something new , wether it is skydiving , traveling to a new country far away , or playing a new sport with their grandchildren .but `` enjoying life  has a lot of different sites and the variety of the word ` joy  is differs from person to person .some people enjoy life by having a family and live a quiet life at their farm in the middle of nowhere .others like to live a `` starlife  in hollywood or any other big city .even other people enjoy their life , risking their lifes everyday , by exploring any new extremsport .some people need a lot of money to enjoy their lifes , others do not .so the question is very difficult to answer .but from my point of view and my young background , i think that most young people enjoy their life more than older people , just because of the fact that they are more open and do not worry about their future as much as older people do .
