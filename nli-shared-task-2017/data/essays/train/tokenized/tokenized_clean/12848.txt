enjoying life is not always directly related with the ages .its actually requires both skills to be more dynamic as most of the young people do and to have more encourage as the older people have by their life experience .maybe the word of dynamizm may not be enough to explain how is important to have a certain attitute to enjoying life .the one first must be peacefull with own and with surrounding .then self-confidence becames and it makes the people more relax .since most of the young people has much less concern to worry about than i agree the young people has more potential to enjoy life .also the chemically wise that for sure there is much more activity in the body of young people .it might help to be more healty and dynamic and makes easy to live .even emotionally , it is correct that the younger people are more active than the older ones .do you think , all these fact says us that the younger people can enjoy life more than older ones ?mostly but not entirely .there might be still something missing i guess .young people are more suitable to get dissapointed by intersections between their great expectation due to huge imaginations and the concrete tough rules of the reality of life .they are also more attent to take weong decitions due to their blowing blood and rush of everythin .how the people can be happy with this dilemma ?here the life experience comes as a solution .while the one gets more and more experience form the life - mostly the bad ones - then gain more abilit to evaluate better the conditions and to take better decisions ,so finally it would be better to be a older who have younger blood .
