taking risksmostly people are afraid to take risk in their lives .they prefer to live in safe .that s why they do not want to change their conditions .but in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves .there are many people who are successful take a lot of risks .so successful people try new things and take risks : although some peole think that they only doing what they already know how to do well .first of all , risks and new things expand the vision of people , because every new thing and risk brings new experiences .by this experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions .so their vision is changed according to their experiences .for example ; my father is an engineer .when he graduated he went to germany for his intership .he worked as a worker in a building .during his intership , he experienced and analised how he could built a strong building .now he has own company which is related with building structures .opponent argue that , successful people only doing what they already know how to do well .good productions bring success .for this people should know how to do and improve it .in this way , they do not need to take risks or experience new things , because they can maintain this from books .it is unlikely to be true .books are not enough for improvement , because they only include theoritical knowledge .in practice , experience is more neccessary instead of theorical knowledge .also by taking risks and trying new things , people improve their experience .to sum up , if people want to be successful , they should try new things and take some risk .by this , they can improve their abilities such as problem solving ability .according to their experience and vision , they create their own practical solutions .
