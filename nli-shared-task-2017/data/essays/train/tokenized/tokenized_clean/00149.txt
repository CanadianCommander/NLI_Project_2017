how many times have you got deceived by commercials ?how many times have you regreted buying things you saw on commercials because they were not as good as they seemed ?i am sure that this happened to many of you .i think that commericals always inflate what products really are .there are many products which are not good and have lots of commercials .on the other hand , there are many products that do nt do much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time .so a product having many advertisements does nt necessarily mean that the product is good .i can speak about this out of experience .i once saw an advertisement on the television about a soultion that removes all types of stains .i was so thrilled by the advertisement that i bought one for me and one for my sister .one day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt .i proudly got the soultion and rubbed it on the stain as instructed .shockingly , i figured out later that the more i rubbed the more the stain spread .i was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day .in addition , a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect .i once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste gives 12-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque .as a dentist , i knew that this did nt make any sense .there is no such thing as `` 12-hour protection  .it is well-known that plaque starts growing on teeth right after you brush them .unfortunately , false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers .therefore , i think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments .
