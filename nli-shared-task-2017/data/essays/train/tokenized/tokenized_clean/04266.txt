i do not agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .first of all the advertisors and the companies have the main goal to gain new and a high amount of costumers by advertising for their product .so the main reason why products are advertised is to show the potential costumers or consumers that this specific product might give them a nicer time or a better or even an easier life .off course the advertised product needs to be presented from its best side so that the consumer feels attracted to buy the product and to test it first .if the costumer is satisfied with the product the product was worth it beeing advertised .but if the customer is not satisfied with the product he or she has still the right to return the product and get the money back .in general nowadays the costumers have a lot of rights to defend them selves from cheaters and companies selling products with bad qualities .to increase the competions in the capitalist market all companies try to produce products with better qualities and more attracting to the consumers .the second important reason why it should nt be in the will of the advertisors to present the product better than it is in reality is that their company and its existence depends on the a positive `` oral propaganda  among the people .for example if one costumer is not satisfied with a product he or she will tell her friend , neighbour , relative or family not to buy it and so the company will loose costumers and off course money .the third point is that because all these given reasons a company would nt sell and represent a product if it is not hundred procent sure of the quality of the product .
