i agree with the statement on the idea that the best way to travel is when one is guided by someone that knows the place .nevertheless , i disagree with it when it says that it necessaryly has to be with a group led by a tour guide .my personal opinion is that traveling by one s own sometimes can be a disaster , so i think that being guided is a good point .on the other hand , i think that travel groups of people that does not know each others are not a good combination .i will describe arguments supporting it as well as i will refute travel groups .first of all , i would like to stress the imporatance of knowing the place that one plans to visit .people usually visit large cities where there are a huge variety of museums , atractions or bars .i strongly believe that it is almost impossible that one person can know such a big city without having lived there for a long period .therefore , it does not make sense to visit a city that you already know .what i mean with this reasonement is that a group of travelers need a guide to completely take advantage of some place .in my personal opinion , the more one knows the person that has to guide , the more confortable and enjoying a travel could be .i also know that there are many travel guide books , some of them really complete ; however , i still think that knowing the best of a place is something that hardly can be learnt reading from a book .the second argue that i said i would describe is why i think that travel groups are not the most suitable choice .a travel is something that people does no usually do very often , it can be due to lack of money or free time .this fact inmediately makes a travel be something to enjoy and not a rutine at all .i find that sometimes travel groups , even more when they have a extrict schedual , do not allow you the necessary freedom to enjoy vacations .people usually have very stressed lives and the last thing one needs on vacation is to be more stressed with more scheduals and compulsory tasks .in addition , i find that traveling with a big group of unknown persons is not as confortable and satisfactory as traveling only with friends , couple or family .these are the two main reason because i partly agree and disagree with the statement .to sum up , i would like to stress the importance of traveling with someone guiding ; and how unsuitable i find doing it with a group .
