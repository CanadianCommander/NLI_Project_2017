i do nt think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way .as i have a lot of travelling experince i am convinced that travelling by yourself is the best way to do it .with doing so you have much more freedom because you can make decisions on your own and do nt have to consider someone else .this also prevents you from possible arguments with the group or your travelling partner which could lead to a vacation you do nt enjoy fully .another important advantage , in consideration of a tour guide , is that you get to explore places on your own and do nt have to stick to a certain travel itinerary .this offers you a lot more possibilities and you can stay at places you like and avoid the ones you do nt like .tour guides have their program which they run through every trip .i think this is unpersonal .when i am travelling i want an individual route that s the perfect fit for me and gets the most out of my time .mostly you wo nt find this in a guided tour because it is designed to satisfy the needs of a broad range of people and a lot of times covers the really touristy spots .i am not such a fan of this .you get to know a country much better if you go to places where the local people are instead of all the tourists .when travelling alone you are much more responsive to new people .while i was travelling in australia i met so many new people which i probably never would have talked to , if i would have been in a group .but when you are by yourself you are more open for making new friends , just for the simple reason to not be alone all the time .furthermore it broadens your culture knowledge and understanding .last but not least it is more expensive to book a guided tour than to explore the country by yourself .
