although some successful people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , i prefer to try new things and take risiks .because , trying new things and risks breaks the monotony , gives name and fame , and also gives soul satisfaction and offer new things and technology to the society .first , life is short , so trying new things and taking risks breaks monotony .for instance , doing same thing in whole life makes man to feel bore and lack of enthusiasm .i always prefer to do new things to get some interest .probing dvelves the new things those are useful to the society .i think success comes from trying new things .second , man should get name and fame by trying new things and taking risks .for instance , computer technology providing so many benefits to the society , this is because of people trying new things in thier life .previously people did not use cell phones , but this technology making life easier and happier to the people .so trying new things will help the society .third , one can get soul satisfaction for inventing and discovering new things for society , and these gives permanent happiness and one can forget his pain when he tread long path .for instance , we still memorise few scientists names ( thomas alva edison ) , they tried new things and gave few benefits to the socity .in summary , successful people try new things and take risks help the socity , breaks monotony , and name and fame .by doing adventures people get satisfaction and happiness .
