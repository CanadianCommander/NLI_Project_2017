i totally agree with this statement .doing just the things that all people do is not really creative and will never differ a specific person from the others .but being successful means being different and taking risks otherwise everybody would be successful .we all know the phrase : ` no risk , no fun  .that can be used for many parts in life .for example in the stock market .there are so many investment bankers .who are the real successfull ones ?the guys who took the highest risks !another example is given in the movie business .how many of this famous hollywood stars have ever finished or even started university ?most of them did not !they took the risk of being a star or a nobody .same to all this well-known hip-hop stars like snoop dog or r. kelly .but it is not just the risk that people have to take to become successfull .they also have to try new things .the have to be innovative .bobby dekeyser is innovative .bobby dekeyser is succesfull .being a former soccer player he decided to open his own business .his idea was to create high-quality chairs .the problem was that he could not find anybody who would invest in his idea and the much worser thing was he did not know anything about chairs .but after ten years of hard fights for his idea and his dream he is now one of the most famous chair producers and his company called dedon produces for stars like brad bitt or nicolas cage .to recap the mentioned points it is important to understand through the given examples that to be successfull means not only to take high risks or doing something different than the others .it means also fighting for odreams and not giving up in difficult times .all those things together make people really successfull .
