i think it is not so simple to explain about this .why ?because i ask this question to myself different times .i am a student .i study civil enginnering in milan .during my different exams i have found some important subjects : general subjects ( for example maths ) and specific subjects ( for example road construction or structural design ) .general subjects help you to understand the specific subjects .but the problem is this : when i will take my degree people will see me as civil enginner .what i can do in particular is not important .i think that university must teaches different accademic subjects , so you can have a wide vision about a work , like a civil enginner .after a degree , every person will improve his knoledge in one specific subject .in my situation , for example , a civil enginner will specialize in road construction or skyscrapers or off shore structure .it depends what part of civil enginner he like .
