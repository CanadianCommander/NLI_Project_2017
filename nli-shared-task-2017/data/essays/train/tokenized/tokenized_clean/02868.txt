yes i agree with the statement , because logic of the car in a city is always based on the fact that there is a fuel present in , on which it can run .so the basic fact should be that - presence of fuel in abundance .but that is not the case , as we all know fuel ( petrol , diesel ) are non renewable souces of energy .the fuel takes thousand of years ro come in to being , but they are reducing faster as compare to their presence with us .so in return their prices are increasing day by day .and people have already started taking for different alternatives like cng ( compressed natural gas ) , lpg ( liquified petroleum gas ) .but the irony is that these options are also non renewable .so somewhere down the line the prices of fuel wether in any form which i have talked about will be so high that middle class and upper middel class will not be able to afford it and hence they will use public transport to commute .so that class vehicles will not be prent on roads wether car or two weheeler .after sometime say 10 yrs more the fact will hit the upper class too and we will not have any car or vehicle on road .the time line about this danger , which i have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can have even calculations about it if he/she has both the population and existing fuel count .they should also have the rate at which fuels are getting depleted .so the best way to tackle the proablem is to find out renewable source of energy through which one can commute to different places .surely the work has already been started , because the affect of this fear is already noticable in the current scenario .
