for the decades young people have been considered to be more willing to enjoy life than older people do unlike in ancient time when it was common sense that you could not enjoy life until you had reached a certain age .how can we explain those statementsone thing is for sure ; young people tend to seize each day because even in his early age an human being is fully aware of his fragility and on day he will die like everybody else .one could argue that applies even more to older people but i truly believe that this feeling is fundamental in the mind of a youth .i do believe that young people enjoy more life and i think that it is the consequence of the desire of a teenager or a young adult to break free and to be in charge of everything when it comes to his life .therefore because it is the first time that they have the opportunity to live fully they enjoy life like they will never again , paradoxically enough it is enjoying your life that makes you forget after a certain lapse of time what it is to really enjoy life .with time you tend to take everything for granted and you realize one day that your missing the simple pleasures that you used to crave about .growing up is an hard time for everyone ; it is the time when you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do .in this time of insecurity usualy young people are smart enough to make the best of what they have amd to take advantage of anything that might happen to them .to get somewhere in life one has to assert itself and in order to do so one has to be mature enough that is why i believe that w you are older you are able to enjoy life in a whole different way .
