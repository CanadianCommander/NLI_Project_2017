i disagree with the statement .in my opinion the best way to travel is alone by yourself .travelling alone you can wander for many places knowing the culture of the place that you visit .also you can spend your time with native people who show you the identity of such society .when i go abroad i try to travel alone because you can know the culture and the way of life of the people .if you travel with a tour guide you could probably know about the history of the place or other topics that you can read in a book .when you travel alone you can wander for several places not only to the common places such as landscapes or museums .you can walk throughout the city without a fixed schedule visiting the places that you want .i like to travel alone instead of travel in a group .if a travel alone i can spend a lot of time knowing native people .i can share their customs or their way of life and learn the native language as well .when you travel in a group you should do anything that the majority want .if you travel in groups you would spend more time with your group than native people .i have visited several countries and i have tried to spend most of my time with native people .i believe that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guide or travel in a group .if you travel alone you can learn the culture of such place like a native .you can know many issues that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group .i like to travel alone because i can spend a lot of time with native people knowing their problems and thier way of life .therefore , i prefer to travel alone by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
