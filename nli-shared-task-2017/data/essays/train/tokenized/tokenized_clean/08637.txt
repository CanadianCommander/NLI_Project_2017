students should learn facts more than understnading ideas and concepts .there are two reasons for this : effectiveness and usefullness .it is much effective lean things with facts because you can picture the ideas instead of pondering them for a long time .the physic class is the most typical example for this .it is not easy to underestand the gravity and speed on earth by leaning formules such as e = m3 .however , nobody would doubt the fact when the train stops there is a resistace of the speed .moreover , facts enable us to pictureize the ideas .we know that how atomicbomb are deadly neagative for human-being and it should not be utilized ever again .but the idea itself is not as strong as an experience which we can still see through films and visiting hiroshima and ngasaki in japan where atomic bombs were thrown .it is a direct effect to re-experience things visually and sensitively .facts are more usefull on our daily lives rather than ideal concepts .the concepts of economic theories does not represent the society but the currency rates are more familier to us and inevitally affect our lives .when we travel to other countries , we care largely about the currency rates where we go on a trip .the strength of money affects the strength of the purchase during the trip .thus , it is usefull to study how the world monetary system is working .therefore , i support that it is better to learn facts before understanding ideas and concepts .the facts give us more direct knowlges .it also massively affect our daily lives .
