people who have success in their lifes , very often try to push their limits to the test .having had the sweet feeling of success , they tend to know that else is possible .like so many people in our material society , they first wanted to have success .so , success automatically comes along with money or respect .being an individual member of this society , but still seen as someone special because of his achivements , the successful man ( or woman ) tries to stay on top , proving to himself and the mass that he could achieve everything , being someone special .so , the things he used to do are nt so special anymore , what means that there must be new , more exciting challenges waiting .so , knowing that he is a `` winner  , the successful man has the power ( wherether it is money , influence or popularity ) and can do what he plans , which is giving him the kick he needs .i think you could compare successful people with junkies .not in a selfdestructive way , but in the way they always need more and more to be satisfied , which is a phenomena that can be proved by looking at the worlds  top managers nowadays .earning more in one month than an average worker would earn in one year , still not satisfied and greedy .i have the opinion that successful people often do not specifically realize that it is greed , what is driving them to push their limits .they tend to ignore that fact and take risks more easily than a `` normal  person would do .in the end , i do nt agree with the statement above , for i think that trying new things and taking risks is just a needed prove for these people , that no matter what they do , they will always be someone special .these people are just bored by what they achieved so far and need to find something more satisfying for theirselves .but everyone for himself is special , so there is no need for taking the risk to prove it .
