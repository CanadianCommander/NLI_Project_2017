personally i feel that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i feel so because , in the present world wherein competition is at its peak levels , in order to excel in any field we need to have complete knowledge about that particular field .for that we need to concentrate a lot in that subject or field .for example for an elcectronics engineer in order to take very large scale integrated circuits ( vlsi ) as the career we need to have the complete knowledge of chip designing at the miniature levels .we need to be well equipped with all the necessary tools and platforms whcih are part of vlsi , else we cant be a successful designer .having broader knowledge in all the other fields does nt help us to do well in the present field .for example having ample knowledge in operating systems concepts and computer networks doesnt help a person intending vlsi as a career option .all he can do is that he utilise those concepts to an extent but they are not going to help him perceive a career in vlsi .one of the famous saying also states that `` jack of all trades master of none  .it means that a person who intends to master all the fields finds the going very difficult for him .if we intend to succeed in a particular field then we need to plan in such a way that we are also aware of the recent developments in that particular field i.e ... , we have to be upto date regarding that particular subject or field .in ordre to sustain in the competition one needs to be the winner and a winner never takes chances .moreover if we wish to have broader knowledge in many acdemic subjects it will be difficult for us to concentrate in each and every aspect of every subject .in course of broadening our horizon in one subject we may not find sufficient time or we may not pay attention to the other subject , which may lead to the failure of the individual as a whole .morover we may run into a state of situation wherein we may be confused to chose a career comprising of which subject .one can not find a career which offers or applies all the subjects he or she has studied .finally , i conclude that it is advisable to be specialized in one specific subject rather than havingf broadened knowledge of many subjects .
