i agree withe the statement , i believe that young people do enjoy life more than older people do .i think that innocent , ignorant and worry free young individuals do enjoy life more that experienced , learned and concerned adults do .once we are born we have no worries , in fact new born babies do not know anything about their environment , they are totaly innocent exposed individuals at the mercy of well , adults , who care for them .if there were no concerned adults who had to care for the feeding , care and well being of those children , humanity as we know it would not exist .it is a natural thing , babies eat and cry whenever they re hungy and adults provide nurishment and care for them .ignorance is bliss some poeple say , and you know what , i actually think they are right .once you are ignorant , meaning do nt know of something you do nt worry about it , for example .if i have never heard about cancer or diabetes i will probably not wory about it , as in the old ages where they believed it was some illness caused by spirits or demonds , but once i know about i can cut of the sugar in the case of a diabetic or have chemo or radiation for cancer and worry about it .adults know about responsabilities , about money , about safety and all the possible outcomes of a certain situation .kids do nt , it is actually a kids job to have fun , and it is an adults job to marvel at that miracle of joy that bursts from every childs new discovery .some poeple might say that older people enjoy life more because they know that there will be few moments that you can actually enjoy , but , how is it possible to enjoy more than a young child who has no idea of hardship or sorrow ?life is a wonderful thing as the song `` i ve got the world on a string  says , but it also says `` as long as i hold on to the string  .as adults , we can never predict when that string will leave our finger .while young people , babies , kids in general dont even know that it is they , who actually hold the whole world , and our destiny in their tiny little hands .
