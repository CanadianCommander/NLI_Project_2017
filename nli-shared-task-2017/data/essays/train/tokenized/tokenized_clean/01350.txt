in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i extremely agree with because of following two specific reasons .first .using the car might be decrease because of economic problems .if you want drive , you can recognize that your car wants fuel .becase of many reasons , oil price is getting expensie .i think there are not many people to afford such a high price for driving .secondly , people who live in a big city do not have enough time for exercise .i can see many warning copies and ads .most of doctors suggest that people have to exercise more than they think .my university noticed that use a bycicles rather than cars or motorcycles .school doctor also said to me that do more exercise .many people will join this campaign , and so many people use their bycicles instead of cars .i m sure that this movement is not only processing in my country .in conclusion , i m sure that there are many beneficial aspects by using car .but i strongly argue that in twenty years will be fewer cars than today because of economic and personal reasons as i said .
