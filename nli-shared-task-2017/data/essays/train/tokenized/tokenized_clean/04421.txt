i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .my conviction is based on three reasons .first , the low birthrate in many countries will cause a sharp reduction in the number of future drivers .it is a well-established fact that the largest number of drivers are found in developed countries in north america , europe and japan .it is also clear that birthrate has been dropping during the past decades in these regions .with the reduction of population , there will certainly be a reduction in the number of drivers and cars .it can be argued that china is a rising market for cars .however , i do not believe that the growth in chinese market will make up for the loss in other places .besides , the largest number of cars are found in the east coast big cities , where the streets are already jammed with cars and can not make room to hold more .second , the gas shortage will help to reduce the number of cars .the energy crisis that we are facing today will also be faced by the next generation .due to the limited energy supply on this planet , people in the future years will define gas shortage as a more serious problem than we do .considering the difficulty of discovering an alternative energy to replace gas , i am convinced that change of numbers of car will be pretty obvious in the near future .third , the reduction of number of cars is and will continue to be fueled by people s rising concern of the environmental issues .over the past decades , people have come to realize that the substances emitted by vehicles will cause an unrevocable damage to our environment .with the progress made in our understanding to the earth , it will become even clearer that cars using the currently available fuels will have a long-term , negative effects on the atmosphere and our health .in summary , i have full confidence that , due to the low birthrate , gas shortage and people s environmental awareness , there will be fewer cars in the twenty years to come .
