i ultimately agree with the fact that it is better to be specialized on a specific subject than to spread energy on different subjects .however i say ultimately , because being and staying focused on one subject means always to discard other subjects .i found the focus necessary and very important at a certain late stage of the personal working career or academic career .the reason behind his you build up some `` spikes of knowledge  on a broad knowledge platform .these sharp spikes of knowledge will allow you to promote yourself and to pull with you the society forward .having said that a deep knowledge of one subject can only be based on the focus on a certain subject and none us are born with a direction and with a goal ready to be accomplished from the day of birth .instead we should find our path and our focus by ourself and to do that we need a broad range of knowledge .think for example to the manager of a company who is very good financially , but it doesent know history , politics ...he will always take the best financial decision and at the same time will always have a strong opposition inside his team or industry , because as he does nt know the history and the culture of the people behind the business , he will never be able to respect them .therefore i think in an early stage it is positive to broad our knowledge on different subjects like : history , languages , politics , arts , mathematics , phisics , biology , economy ...however at a middle or later stage we should focus or refocus on the subjects we love more or on the subjects which will give us more satisfactions .as an example for this i can talk about myself .i have received an education on differents topics from latin to mathematics , i have study engineering and i got a doctorate degree in engineering , however one day i found out that my life was in business , therefore after 12 years working in sales & marketing , i decide to build up my knoledge focused on business matters and to pursue an mba study and i am sure that this will bring success to myself and to the people around me .
