the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they are in reality is very true .when i am watching tv at home and get to know new advertisements i ignore it .if products would be as good as the advertisements promise them to be people would only buy products of which they have seen an advertisement .for example there are only stars that advertise for a product when you watch tv .alone this fact shows that advertisements manipulate the watcher .of course there are products which you see on tv that are really good in reality but most of the products are not as good as you think they have to be when you see them on tv .the producers of a new product have to think very well about what kind of advertisement would be the best for there product .concerns pay millions of dollars in order to produce a new advertisement clip on tv in order to increase the number of sol products .if that would nt work they would not spend such sums of money .of course the number of sold products also depends on whether the product is really good or not .i think that it is better to compare products or to to ask people which product they prefer instead of convincing on a supermodel that that is just enjoying an ice cream on tv .but there have to be people that are believing everything that is told on tv , radio or in some magazines and those people make that the concerns benefit with their advertisements .personally i believe in the experiences i made and decide if i take aspecial pizza once more or if i should choose another one the next time .advertisements do nt have any influences on me .as a conclusion i think that only few products are as good as actors ensure in advertisements because i was nearly everytime disappointed when i bought a product that i admired on tv .perhaps i have had always bad luck .
