the main objective of any educational system is to try to teach students concepts and facts simultaneously .it is thought certain than people would become more complete if they could learn both from theory and experience .however if a choice should be made what part would be better ?i seems to me that it is more important to understand concepts than to learn facts .indeed , ideas and concepts are very difficult to understand and requires specific teaching whereas facts can be learnt throught experience .furthermore it is not the role of a teacher to have a deep knowledge of general facts .besides the students need to know the theory in order to understand facts .ideas and concepts are very vague topics which requires an intense learning program .indeed , an idea usually spreads out from centuries , if not millenium , of questionnig and debates and thus a rather long time is needed to understand the basis of an idea .therefore , only people who have dedicated their entire life to a certain topic can be able to explain clearly the true meaning of a concept .consequently it is merely impossible to aprehend an idea just by witnessing a consequence it might have on a person or a thing .in the opposite , facts are easily understood by simple observation .thus , students might have a better comprehension of unknown facts than new concepts .for instance , it is more difficult to learn from experience the idea of love than undertanding the reasons of a car crash .therefore students should learn what is less easier to experience which in this case are ideas and concepts .secondly , as it has been stated in the previous part , only qualified people are able to talk precisely of ideas .those experts are refered in the educational system as teachers .a teacher is a person which has a deep knowledge of a sepcific field of area .by studying and exchanging ideas with collegues , teachers are able to gain expertise on ideas and concept .however , the very concept of their expertise is that they do not rely on specific facts but ; ore on general ideas .for that reason they are not qualified to share their experience with students .finally , understanding facts requires that previously the student has been aware of the theory .a fact can only be fully understood when the underlying ideas and concepts are known .students should then concentrate on learning ideas .besides the very principle of an idea is that it is therotical and needs to be discussed within groups such as classrooms .life provides examples but how could students possibly understand events without the necessary background ?
