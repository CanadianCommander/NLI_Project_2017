there is no need to know the things like concepts and ideas , which are already known by everyone .in order to be much more creative and productive , students have to learn the facts instead of understanding the concepts and ideas .in my opinion , there are some basic reasons for that .first of all , internet has become an important factor in students life .they can search the information which they have been looking for and they can learn the facts easily .secondly , it is much more beneficial for the students to learn the facts .if they are forced to research the information and datas , they will probably create their own ideas about a topic instead of understanding an old one .that will make them much more creative and prouductive .for instance , think a teacher who gives an assignment to the students about a political issue .if student searches the internet by using google , he or she will have some information about the issue and maybe has a little information that already exists .but if he or she tries to understand the basics of politics and learnes the fundamental facts , he or she can create his own opinon about that issue .to sum up , in order to be creative , students should spend their time by reading and researching the facts that they do not know .they must learn the facts in order to have their own about topics instead of memorising the consepts and the ideas which have already been known .
