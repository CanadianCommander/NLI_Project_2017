each educated people need a academic knowledge in order to be effective in his future work and in society .hereafter , i m going to analyse the pros and cons of the broad knowledge and the specific knowledge before drawning any conclusion .first of all , having a broad knowledge may be very helpful since you can talk about or understand any subject .this ability is very important since we are living in a multicultural society where the range of skills is very broad .then it might be useful to get that kind of knowledge because every one is going to change jobs two or three times in his lifetime career and being aware of other issues tham those related to your major is important .however , broad knowledge is very time-consuming .you will probably meet great difficulties dealing with different subjects and this may cause you to have very superficial view of those subjects .what about the specific knowledge then ?it improves your capacity to master one subject .one striking example is well-educated people known as experts .experts are basically the referrence on one field .they are like referrees in games because their statements are doubtless and must be absolutely true .this is because they are supposed to possess all of the current knowledge humankind have on the subject .the wrong side of this specific knowledge is that you are not aware of what s going on elsewhere and you can not just change from one job to another .that can make the difference in a changing world .for example people specialized in bulding old - fashion televisions called cathodic televisions can not move on to the next step and deal with new high technology flat screens .in my opinion , to be effective and to socially fit in , every one need both kind of knowledges .thus , one can at the same time adapt to any situation and be very skilfull in the field in which they will work and achieve their goals .
