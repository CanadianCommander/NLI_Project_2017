some say that , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .this makes no sense and is not logical at all when we consider the real facts that we see everyday .there are two main points which shows that the number of cars in use will increase instead of decreasing ; firstly , it is already increasing instead of staying the same ; and secondly , the world and the countries are getting bigger so they will be more necessary in the future .first of all , it is obvious that the number of cars are inreasing each day goes by ; so it is not really wise to say that it will decrease in time .it is not really possible for thousands of people to suddenly say that `` ok , i do not want to use cars anymore ..moreover it is a need for people more than a choice and nobody seems to solve the transportation problems .the fact is , people will keep buying cars unless there is a better way offered for them to go where they want to go and it seems like it is so far away from now and the future .secondly , the cities and the countries are getting bigger ; and it is not a really good option to use public busses , taxi or metro anymore .cars seem to be the best option .taxi is a really expensive way for transportation and busses are really slow .metro is neither but it is really crowded and there happen too many crimes in the metros so it is not a really good option either .cars are in the middle of all of these .it has all these problems and risks as well but in little amounts .so again , cars are the best option that people have .to sum up , because of the reasons that the numbers of cars are already increasing and the world is getting wider everyday , the number of cars will not decrease in the future .in fact , it is more reasonalbe to say that this number will increase .in every aspect , cars are the best option that is offered to humanity and no one seems to be looking for another option for them .in order to decrease the number of cars in use , people must be offered something new and better to use .
