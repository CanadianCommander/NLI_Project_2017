from what i learned , knew and heard and told throughout this life .it is much more importnat for a person or a student in this situation to understand idears and concepts than to learn facts .to learn facts you have to understan the concepts and the idea of what you are learning .therefore as an example : a person can learn a fact from a book about the world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginig .every person have brains therefor , it should be used .logic and commen sence are all maters for understanding ideas and cocepts .a person can memorize a book but that doent mean that the person understood it .people should use their brains to understand things .for example : newtons laws of motion , `` for every action there is a reaction  .a person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts , but a person can use his brain and a littel bit of commen sence and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts .however learning facts is important for a person to do , but not as important as understandin the ideas and learning the concepts .facts are important for example when a person rights a paper , he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying .while a person can teach something if he didnt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough .as i said before a person needs his brain , logic , and commen sence .therfore understanding ideas and learning concepts are much important than learning facts .
