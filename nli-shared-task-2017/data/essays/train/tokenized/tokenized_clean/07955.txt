although travelling in a group led by a tour guide could have a great positive impact on the travellers experience and knowledge base , such perks are more that often diminished in comparison to the manifold problems and distractions that arise from such trips .it is true that tour guides , especially local ones , are more knowledgeable when it comes to their cities and provide deeper insights and plausible suggestions on what and where to see and do .futhermore , in a group situation , being part of events and trips is usually more interesting and enjoyable and provides a great opportunity to meet other people and make new friends .however having a tour guide and being part of a group could hinder the overall experience of a city or place due to the numerous formalities and regulations they tend to emphasize .with tour guides comes cast in concrete planning of every minute and hour of every day , week and month .since tour guides are managing large groups of people it is very important to keep time and schedule for every aspect of the trip ; from visiting monuments and tourist sites to dining and sleeping .unfortunately , this would take away all the spontaneaity from the trip rendering it very systematic , dry and simply boring .not knowing what you are going to do for the day , or sleeping in in another might be all that you need to rejuvenate yourself during your travels .paralleling such arguments and in response to the dynamics of group travelling , many other negative aspects usually arise .having too many people would usually result in conflict ; it is very hard to get consensus in the case of a decision making situation .furthermore , it is the nature of a group to include people from diverse backgrounds and value systems .this would more than often surface at some point and cause some kind of disagreement that would result in a bigger complication that both parties would have to keep up with until the end of the trip .therefore , one can avoid such problems when travelling by choosing to travel with a couple of friends or family members instead of being part of large highly organized systematic group experirnce .having a guide book or asking locals for suggestions would adequately substiture for a nagging tour guide .now a person could be more spontaneas and not governed by rules and regulations on the only true break he/she might get per year .i believe i have strong convictions towards my opinions for the reason that i was part of a group trip that was led by a tour guide for too long period of time during one of my summer vacations and that certainly did not turn out to be a good experience .
