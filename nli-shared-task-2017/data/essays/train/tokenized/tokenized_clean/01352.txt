i agree with the given statement which states that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are number of reasons and examples that support this statement .the objective information that most of the advertisements show seem very attractive to the public and in many cases that information might not be necessarily accurate .i can not comment that the information is incorrect , but some details might be hidden in the information that they show to the public .the best example for this is the ` vehicle fuel economy  numbers that the auto advertisements show .if the vehicle is driven under specific conditions , the stated fuel economy can be achieved .but practically , under normal driving conditions , it is simply not possible .another reason is that the fine print in the advertisements that people in general ignore and would face the consequences later .as an example , once i opened the home equity line of credit account with a bank because the interest rates were lower .i ignored the fine print which says that i need to pay huge penalty if i terminate the accouint with in 2 years after opening the account .interest rates went up soon after opening the account , and i had to pay fairly big amount to terminate my account with them .the reasons and the examples explained here might be specific , but in general one way or the other , the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .and , i believe that one of the main purposes of the advertisements is exactly that .this is one of the business strategies of most of the big companies to suceed in today s business environment which is extremely competitive .in conclusion , it is very obvious that most of the advertisemsnts make products seem much better than they really are .and as discussed above , to some extent , it has become essential for many companies to follow this strategy to succed in the businees in current competetive environment .
