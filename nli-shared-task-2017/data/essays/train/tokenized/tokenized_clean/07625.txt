i completely agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .younger people enjoy their life more than older people because of the fact that they have to take care of lesser responsbilities than the older ones do .younger people need not worry much about their future they need to worry mostly about their subjects , while the older people have to worry about a lot of things ranging from tensions in the office to what to cook tonight .younger people enjoy life with their friends they go out for parties and clubs with their friends more frequently then the older ones do , even though older ones go out to party their mind is always preoccupied by tensions .for older people the burdens keep on increasing day by day and they find little time to enjoy , but for youngsters every second is for enjoyment and they enjoy their nlife to the fullest .older people also have the problem of taking care of their children .older people also are worried about their future the time after they retire .younger people also have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents whenever they have a problem and need not have any worries .younger people have the privelege of a number of holidays when they have plenty of time to enjoy their life .though most of the younger people enjoy their life more then the older ones there are older people who enjoy life more then the younger ones do , for example dr. vijay mallya who enjoys his life more than any youngster does .i feel that younger people enjoy more than older people do because they have lesser burdens than the older ones .they have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents and need not worry much but only have to enjoy .
