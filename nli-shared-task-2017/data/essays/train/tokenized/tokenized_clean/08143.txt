when students study , they need to understand what they study , rather than learning the fact of it .because , understanding of idea and concept will be helpful to understand problems much deeply , much easier to memorise , and much appicatable for other problems that they have faced .first , understanding idea and concept will be helpful to student to understand what they study better then fact .when student start understand idea and concept of certain questions , they will find what was the cause , and how it works .it s like guiers .all the teeth of guiers are matching perfactly the machine works .therefore , to understand what they studing deeply , then they need to understand what is the idea of it .second , understanding of idea and concept will be in students  mind longer time than learning facts .because , there are lost of fact in all single questions .if students start to study facts , then they have to memorise all of the facts which is bigger number than ideas and concepts .lots of fact can be found in lots of similar type of questions , however those are similar questions , so if the students remember only one idea or concept , then they will able to solve all of questions , instead of remembering all of factors for each questions .therefore , understanding ideas is much easier than learning facts , so that will be remained in students brain for much longer time .third , ideas are much appicatable than facts when they have some other problems .when they understand the idea , they will follow on that idea and stick branches of lots of thinking and reaches much further idea and study more widely .however , the facts are too certain , narrow .also it can not be changed , like a stone .none of branches can stick on a stone , so students will know how to get a bird with the stone , but will not know how to play ` catch ball  with the stone .therefore , figuring out and understanging ideas will be much goof for application for other things and will be much useful when they face some other new problem .therefore , students have to understand the idea of what thay study , so that will be much helpful in lots of way of their studing .so that is much practical way of studing then learning facts .
