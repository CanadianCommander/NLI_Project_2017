by virtue of having ` been there , done that  , i believe that older people with the gamut of experiences that comprise their lives , enjoy life more so than the young ones who are yet to find their feet .a younger body also implies a mind that is yet to develop to its full potential .despite the physical crutches that age may come with , it remains a magnificent process of learning and developing as an individual .it is said that with age comes experience .the experience of years past allows an individual to view situations differently .the reaction of a 6 year old on getting his first cycle might seem more jubilant than that of his grandfather but the quite pride of watching his grandson gleam with pleasure , speaks of the hard work and commitment that the wrinkled face one sees has learn to put in , to give others such joy .my friend s sister , rita , had had a fight with her friend ayesha over a trivial matter .whlist she did nt want to b the first to aplogise , she still spent the day in a foul mood waiting for ayesha to initiate the peace making process .for a young person , a certain situation might seem more complex than it actually is and that was the situation here till rita s mother explained to rita that she needed to judge what held greater importance - her own pride which forbid her from calling , or then her relationship with a friend .as an older individual , her mother was able to share her own perspective that would enable rita to make intelligent emotional choices in the future .as one gets older , it can not be assumed that one stops enjoying one s life .i feel young at heart  , ive heard my father say many a times which brings me to the only conclusion - the number of candles on your cake do nt decide how happy you are but how you spend the time that is marked yours .
