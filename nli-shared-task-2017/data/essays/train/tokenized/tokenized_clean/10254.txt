in my opinion , most advertisement should not make products seem much better that they really are .this is because , it will be more confusing , and the consumers will be disappointed .if the advertisements are much better that real products , it is same as the companies told a lie .i you bought the products affected by the advertisements , you feel the products are different from the products which were shown by the advertisements .therefore , the products actually differ , and the advertisements , in fact the companies , must be fake .if the avobe situation was happened , what are you going to feel ?i think probably you get upset .this is because the products which you bought are worse than the products which were shown by the advertisement .so you must feel the companies are liers .i have an example of such situation .one day , i bought the elextronic souces , and the advertisement of the product showed `` the electronic souces are keeped for 1 year  .i looked the sentence before i bought , and also i decided buying it from the sentence .at first , the electronic souces worked comfortably .however , about 1 month later , the elecronic souces did not work , it meant the product became empty .in fact , the product was not keeped for 1 year , it was only keeped for 1 month .then , of course i got upset , because the advertisement was a lie .in conclusion , when the companies make the advertisements , they should not show the product much better than real product , because it is absolutely a lie .
