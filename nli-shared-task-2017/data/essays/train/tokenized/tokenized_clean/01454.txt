i disagree with the idea that the number of the cars in use will decline in two decades .there are two reason for this : convinience and necessity .first , cars are really convinient .it enables you to carry a lot of things when you go shopping and to go many sights like seaside area .recent survey shows that two third of family in rural areas of japan have their own cars to parchase things , go to work and so on .this fact illustrates that cars are necessary for these people .this trend is not going to be changed in twenty years as long as rural areas exist .moreover , cars are demanded even in city area .you can see much traffic jam in tokyo , osaka .and nagoya .so , people will continue to enjoy the convinience of the cars .the second reason is that cars are necessary for developing country and countrys which have big soil .cars play an important role to develop a country .for example , things which is used to make hauses must be transported by cars .big countries ca nt make train rail
