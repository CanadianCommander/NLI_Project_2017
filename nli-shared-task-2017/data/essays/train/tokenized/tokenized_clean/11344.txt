the role of advertisments in purchasing behaviour of consumer for any product is continously rising from a long time .it is true that advertisments make product s feature or chracterstic much better than they really are .i am strongly agree with this statment because of number of valid reasons and examples .it affects consumers and manufacturer in number of ways .first , financial importance of advertisment to manufacturer of product .any manufacturer of products want to sell his products to earn the money or profit out of that process .to introduce a new product or stand with competition with other providers they usually needs to advertise the product .advertisment are usually an expensive way of promotion .therefore , manufacturer use the best part of products to highlight in advertisments .they usually hides the negative part of products .thus consumer usally disguised by claims made by product in advetisments .on the other hand advertisements are also in favour of consumers .these promotional activities make them aware of new products and selective features of products .second , effects of advertisements on consumer .advertisments in pharmaceutical industry usually shows the postive features of any drug .advertisments of drug vioxx by merck labs never talked about the harmfull affect of drug on cardiovascular system on patients .these advertisments increase the usage of drugs in consumer and ended up with serious effects on blood system .on the other hand advertisments helps consumers or patients about the availability of various treatment options .after the advertisments of drugs from pharmaceutical company , patient come to know about the underlying disease and check with their physicains for availabilty of treatment option .therefore , advertisments improves the quality of life for some patients .to sum up , we can say that advertisment usually hides the negative feature of product .but on other side it is beneficial for both manufacturer as well as consumers .advertisements give more chance to growth and innovation .
