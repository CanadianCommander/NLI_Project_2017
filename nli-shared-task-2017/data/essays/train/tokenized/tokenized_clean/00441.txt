i do agree with the statement .facts are important above all as example or expression of the concept wich is behind them .facts are for sure important because they can explain things .they can help rememberimg a thing ; they can focused the attenction on a peculiar aspect of the subject , can be helpfull to explain or capture the ideas wich they follow .you can remeber all the facts that you like , but if you had well understand concepts you will be able to recombine them in different and original ways .you may be able analize even different situation following the same concept .to explain better my point of view i ll take some accademic subjects as examples .for istance it is not important , to me , remembering dates and hours of every single battles as long as you can remeber how the war went , why it broke out , who were fiting and why .in history what it is crucial is the general setting of the period .another good example can be even a scientific subject as the chemistry .it is not essential to remeber wich specific salt and wich peculiar base are combined ( facts ) , as long as you rember the way the reaction goes and wich is the result ( concept ) .reffering to enother subject as sociology what it is important , for example , it is to remember that someone s behaviour can be modified by the society s response to his action .keep in mind every single possible society s reaction it is not that crucial .to resume my point of view in few world : if i can propely understand the concept and the idea of what i m learning i will be able even to elaborate them and to use it even in different suituation .i can recombine concepts in different ways , i can adapt them to a variety of sistuations i might need to analize .
