i agree this statement .young people are too lazy to help people nowdays , although we sing : `` stand hand in hand  everyday in school .young people nowdays are getting more and more selfish .we can hardly see a young person helping a old granny to cross the road nowdays , because we prefer chating with friends beside the roads .i do not really know south african young people s behaviour , but i know young people in china very well .of cousre , not all of us are selfish and unconsidering , but the majority of the youth are selfish .they are everywhere , in the school , on the street and even just in our families .unfortunately , i think that i am one of them too .i remember when i was in the schools of china .we need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves , because that was and still is the part of our school duties .class teacher divided us into several groups , and told us the date that we would be on duty .we want a nice and clear environment to study , although we do not want to do the cleaning by ourselves .therefore we expected the other people could work harder to get the classroom clean .but , other people also thought that way .so , as you can imagine , we all worked not hard eough .therefore , the next day we had a untidy , dirty classroom .people who had duty on that day might think that : they did not do the cleaning well , so why should i ?therefore , the next day we had a untidy , dirty classroom again .then it just carried on like this , so we never had a clear classroom !that looks ridiculous , but that was exactly what happen .that is all about selfishness .young people are just like that , pushing the duties to the others .then the others will push them to someone else .we just can not understand that if we help the others , they will help us oneday , when we are expriencing difficulties .young people nowdays do have enough time to helping their communities , but they just do not want to give it .
