broad view of all the acedamic subjects gives you an overview of all subjects .it helps the person decide which subject he is really interested in .it helps him in choosing his career .however for higher studies one should always specialize in one subject .i believe that specialization in a specific field is better than to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects .firstly specializing in a particuar subject gives you an in-depth understanding of the subject .it helps in understanding of the finer details .careers can be built in that particular subject of interest .like doctors do masters in a particular field eg : cardiology , pathology etc .then they can treat patients having particular disorders like the cardiologists treating heart patients .they can concentrate on one thing and really become a pro at that .this helps both the patients and doctors .secondly specializing give an in-depth knowledge ofthe subject .one can reasearch an a particularly interesting topic and probably invent something in it .it gives an added edge to the person .moreover it develops the person s interest into it .like after learning about networking it really increased my interest in the different types of protocols of networking etc .if given a chance i would really like to work in that field .i feel that it is necessary to have many subjects at the beginning during the undergraduate years where one is not sure about his or her own interests .learning all subjects would help one decide their subject of interest in which they would like to have a career .however once decided it is better to do specialization in one particular subject of interest .thus it is necessary to do aspecialization in one subject of interest .
