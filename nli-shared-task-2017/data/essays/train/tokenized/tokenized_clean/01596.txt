i do not agree with the statement that in twenty years fewer cars will be in use than there are today , because of the importance of cars as a means of transportation .in a globalized world cars have very much influence on our whole life .they are an important means of transportation in trade as well as a means of a flexible lifestyle .without cars the exchange of goods in a globalized world would be much more complicated .also the exchange of people , in the sense of employees and workers , would be much more difficulty .many people depend on their car to reach work .for example people who are working in frankfurt or other big cities are often forced to drive many hours to their place of work , because they can not afford appartments in the cities to life in .without a car they would be forced to move houses or to find work next to their home , which is in many cases because of the high unemployment not possible .without a car people would not be flexible any longer .they would be forced to take the bus or the train , which are often overcrowded , late and in the case of train in germanz very expansive .the limitation of cars would have a deep impact on the whole society .if there would be less cars it would be necessary to replace them by other sources of transportation , like trains or busses .today many cities lack the financial capacities to finance such a big project .because cars vary in their prices and are therefore also accesible for people with a smaller amount , many people will keep buying them in the future .to come to a conclusion i would say that today cars are an important means of transportation as well as a status symbole , and will therefore increase in the future .
