cars are associated with the twentieth century -- they were created at the beginning of this century .nevertheless , since a decade , the sells of cars in europe and in the united states of america are decreasing ; general motors and ford are still in the top 5 of the best car companies , but the first one is not an american .because of environmental issues such as the greenhouse effect caused by emissions of carbon-dioxyde , we may wonder if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .even if , in my opinion , in the industrialised world cars are tending to decrease because of the pressure of some environmental think-thanks , groups or organisations , i fiercely believe that there will be more cars in twenty years than now .indeed , a host of countries which are nowadays in development , may reach their maturity in these twenty years -- for instance , when the asian world , such as china or india , will be considered as industrialized countries , i suppose that an indian or a chinese car constructor would be next to the toyota s rank -- a car major companie .in other words , even though the industrialized world may do a host of investments in common transports such as bus or subway , i assert that in twenty years there will be more car than now .oil rersources , which is the first car energy , are plummeting , and on the opposite , the demande is skyrocketing ; thus , it s tantamout to saying that if there will be fewer energy in twenty years , there will be fewer cars .however , i still maintain that there will be more cars : during these twenty years , i suppose that alternative car s enegies might be founded or created by scientists or ecologists , and therefore , that cars would be still abble and allowed to be driven .the twentieth century is the century of cars .this one may be a bridge between two kinds of transports .nevertheless , the gap is still deep , and that s why i think that there will be more , and not fewer , cars in twenty years .
