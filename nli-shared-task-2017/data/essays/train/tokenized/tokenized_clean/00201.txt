when i was elementary student , i went to swimming school , cram school , and tennis school , so that i did nt have a time to contact with my community .therefore , i agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .the reason is that their parents have the children learn many things .another reason is that the relationship in community is getting weak .many children go to cram school and learn many things such as swimming and tennis .in recent years , people s academic level is emphasised , so that parents let their children go to cram school to get better the their childrens  ability to enter the good school .because of this tendensy , the competition to enter the good school is more higher that that of few years ago .therefore , the parents get their children to go to 2 or more cram school .for example , my cousin is 3 years old , and he already go to kind of cram school to learn how to caculate and english .though he is 3 years old , he daose nt have a time to play with his friends .moreover , if the children have a little time expect the time which they go to cram school , they will use a time to play with their freinds and do nt help their communities .therfore , the time to helping their communities dose nt exsist in youg people s life .the relationship of community is weak .for example , my friend dose nt know the neightboor because they do nt meet each other and there are nt event in their community .thefore , there are nt the oppotunities to know who live in the communities and make frieds with each other .in these comuniti that the citizens relationship is weak , how they can help the neightboor who they do nt kanow .when i was elementary student , the big earthquake was occured in my city .it is noamal to help each other if the disaster occur .however , no one help each other and they just think about their families .the good thing for young people is to help their communities .by doing this , they can get the sprit of voluteer and the sprit of helping people .however , in recently , they are very busy to do learn many things to earn the good school .also , the citizens are only care about their family becasue of weakness of relationship in their communities .therefore , i difenitily agree with the opinion that young people do not give enought time to helping thier communities .
