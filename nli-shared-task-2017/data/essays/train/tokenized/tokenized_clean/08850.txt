is it generally accepted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?in my opinion , i totally agree about the statement .i believe that young people really do nt give enough time to helping their communities .i will argue the statement for some follwing reasons .first of all , parents nowadays expect their children can get high education , so children s activity always studying not communities .because the society becomes more and more wealthy , parents have much time to take care of their child for their performing in class .for example , in order to achieve their expectation of education , parents usually take their child to cram school , that really occupy much time for young people .secondly , because of the developing game producing , young people nowadays usually stay home for playing game not go out to communicate with others .for instance , it is fashion to play ps2 nowadays , young people in order to get high grades in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friends , and they even do nt have any time to commuciate with other people .to sum up , because of the high educated expectation and the fascinating games , young people nowadays focus on books or games instead of communities .therefore , it is my preference that young people do nt give enough time to helping thire comunities nowadays .and i think that is not a good phenonmenon for the future , so we should find some resolutions to improve this .
