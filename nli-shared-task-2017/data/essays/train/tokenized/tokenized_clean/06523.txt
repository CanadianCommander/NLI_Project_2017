some people argue as if it is a general truth that most advertisements do nt make products seem better than they really are .however , to be frank , i ca nt agree with them .as far as i am concerned , i think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .among countless factors why i hold no confidence on them , there are three conpicuous aspects as follows .the primary problem with the statement is that it is ignorant to the basic fact that advertisement is used to sell products .therefore , the advertisements will make the products become what the customers hope and like in order to sell them , which is the purpose and the most common methods of most advertisments .for instance , nobody would like to eat a hamburge which is tiny and over-cooked , instead customers want to have some big and godlooking ones .that s why people always find that the hamburgers they eat in the restuarants seem smallerthan those in the commercials .another reason why i disagree with the above argument is that the advertisements will only mention the advantages of the products .this is also a kind of misleading customers .take some medicine as an example , the advertisement never tell you what the bad effects of the medicine will happen after you use it .the words you can hear are only `` use xxx , use it , make you feel totally comfortable . ..about your illness .finally , what is also worthy noticing is that some words in the advertisements may have different meanings .this makes the consumers may easily misunderstand those words .such as some promotion advertisement , you can get one free product without mantion u have to buy something else first .all in all , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .some make the product much better look , some only mention the good aspects , and others use some trick words to make people misunderstand .taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
