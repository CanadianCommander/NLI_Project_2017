now i am at the later of 20s .combining my own experience and borrowing experiences of my friends in china , i tend to disagree with the statement .in my point of view , both young and the older people knows the importance of enjoying life , however , young people are different from the older one in how frequency , what and why to enjoy life .to start with , mostly young people enjoy life in a different pace from the older one .i think this is one of the factors that mislead others believe that young guys are enjoying life more than the older ones .during weekends or typical vacation seasons , we can easily find young men or women emerging almost every corners of trendy entertainment places , ranging from hot scenic spots to cute bars in the town .on the contrary , older people are rarely found .however , we have to understand more behind that .these occassions are the best time for the young guys to go out since normally during the weekday , they have to spend time in the office from 800am to late as 800pm .it should be more fair to conclude if we considered that it was also the young people who spent most of time during the weekday to work overtime .secondly , young people enjoy life in a variety of forms which are quite different from the older ones .activities such as reading , playing cards or majiang ( a traditional chinese game ) , or watching tv programs are favorite ones for older people .however , nowadays , young people have different funs to enjoy .they enjoy to have activities in a more lively and trendy form such as fitness exercise , hiking , drinking and sharing with friends in the bars .since those trendy activities are more publicized , it is easy to conclude that young people enjoy life more than the older ones .lastly , it is the different view toward life that determines the variance between young peope and older ones when they enjoy life .contrary to older people who more often view life and work are seamless connected in china , youngsters will treat life and work separately .they understand that work is disconnected from life .in some extent , a happy life is the basis for a successful work .therefore , it is critical to enjoy life to full when off work while to concentrate on work vice versa .
