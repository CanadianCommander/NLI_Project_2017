in our world in the schools they give some topics to studennts and they tell them to learn these .the students do npot care about ideas and concepts in it and they just learn what they gave .i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .firstly , at a school there are two kinds of students .the teachers gives them a topic to learn .one of them looks at the topic as a fact which he should quicly learn  the other looks at the topic more detailed .he thinks about the ideas and concepts and this makes him to learn easier .secondly , if a student makes some guesses on the topic or searches for it it makes him to learn easier .after doing this student learns every detail about the topic and after that it is very hard to forget it .thirdly , the education system is very important .for example in our country the system is very bad .we have a oss system after the highschool we attend this exam and if we win we should go to university .this system makes us to think not detailed .so we do not care about the ideas and concepts because we should learn everything immediately as a fact .the reasons are not important for us because we shoul win the race .lastly learning thins as a fact not understanding it makes us to think more small .because we do not know anything else except the topic .we can not think bigger because we do not know how to think we just read and learn like a robocope .the other things are not important for us .to sum up , i think it should be more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts if they really want to be a high person .
