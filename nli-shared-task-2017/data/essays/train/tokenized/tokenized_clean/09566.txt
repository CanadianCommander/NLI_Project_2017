i agree with the statement that successful people have more brave to take risks than they is doing the same thing all the time .personally , people want to be successful .they should have creative ideas in nowadays .the fact is that trying to face challenge and establish their own idea can help people boost their business easier and enjoy the ideal life .to begin with , trying news things and taking risks make it posssible for people to boost their own business .there is no doubt that the world is changing all the time .if people still stick to so what they already know , it is almost impossible to make a living in the competition of the market today .through creativity and challenge , people can amass riches much more easier .for example , bill gaze are not graduated at harvard univerity .however , he becomes one of the richest people in the world .what assist him to be successful is an important issue to discuss .he uses his own ideas and has brave to take risks to build up microsoft which allows everyone to immerse in the digital world .whithout his creativity and spirit , people can not enjoy the convieient life .in addition , creation and challenge make it possible for people to enjoy the ideal life .doubtless , people try to invent new things in the world .without people s new idea , others ca nt enjoy their life all the time .for example , some artist and composers try to create new style paintings and poems , although during the time people do nt think their work are masterpieces .however , many names of van gogh and shakespears are foever engraved in people s collective memory .it allows people today to read their meaning fulpoems and paintings .without their brave and trying to do new things , we can not enjoy the ideal life and see their masterpieces .to sum up , some people would rather to keep their traditional idea and do the same thing all the time .however , i choose differently .the reason is that risks and trying new things make people more sucessfully .
