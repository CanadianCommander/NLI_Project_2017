i agrees that it is better to board knowledge in one specialized specific subject .they are many reasons to claim for the second option because to have board in one specialized subject we can know the deep concept in that subject .i did not prefer boarding knowledge of many academic subjects can not bring much concepts in all subjects .when we r specialized in one subjects we can apply the concepts in the real world .by studying about the different subjects some people cannnot know the concepts in their aware subjects .most of the people are intersted to do specialization in one subject because some willl show more interst in their specialized subject .if people is forced to do the academic subjects he will show the preference in this intresting subject .but knowing of the different subjects come may confused by the concepts they did not know the concept is specified in that subject .doing job in one concerd subject is our aim .by studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many ideas form that subject .by know tooo may subjects is waste because we can not grasp the concepts in different subjects .the familiar in one subject make theman a scientist .in conclusion , doing the specialised in one subject is better .by knowing one specialised subject we can challenged to the real world by our concepts .we can tackle the subject more and more .we can apply the fundamentals and we can invent many many kinds of concepts in that field .so for these reason i support specializes in one subject is better .
