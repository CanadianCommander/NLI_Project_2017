i believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the first reason why i feel this is the fast diminishing petroleum and crude oil reserves across the world .according to one survey which i have read in the newspapers , all the oil reserves in the world may cater the demand for a maximum of another 100 years if the usage continues in the same phase .so the governments may force the public to use less cars to save the petroleum for other important tasks like cooking etc . ,another reason is that even if we develop cars which use electricity in the form of charged batteries as fuel instead of petroleum or diesel , the generation of electricity needs water or coal which are agian non-renewable sources of energy and they can be replenishable .this means that there is no guarantee for those models unless scientists come up with some source of energy like hydrogen gas which can be used as a fuel in the broader perspective without any problems in future .the third reason for my belief is the changing life styles of the people around the world .one may wonder how this effects the usage of cars .now a days , the life style of the modern man has changed a lot , thanks to the luxuries provided by the advancements in the technology .man has so much been addicted to the technology that , even to go to the nearby grocery shop , he needs a means of transportation like car .so the problem of obesity has started .this problem is not now confined to only developed countries .even developing countries are facing the same problem .in fact , obesity has become a global problem .so the doctors are advising the people to have more physical exercise .so i think the means like bicycle may provide the dual benefit and the usage of cars will come down .so , given my reasons , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .
