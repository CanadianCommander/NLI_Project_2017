on the premium art of risk takingsuccess is a very well balanced cocktail .a person whose quest is for success should keep in mind that without taking risk , gaining is virtually impossible .but taking risks is an art in which one should be extremely careful and wise .one should know his vices and virtues , he should know what he is capable of .taking risks by planning cunningly and regardingly what you already know how to do well is the recipe to the elixir .when one studies politics , bussiness or military science , he ll see that success is nearly always achieved by risks taken cunningly .but one will also see that many failures are caused by miscalculated or misinterpretated risks .a person who is in the position to take risks should ever be aware that things can always go bad ; therefore risks should always lean on some quality the risk taker posesses .let s take the battle of thermopylai as an example .the spartans and their allies took the risk of facing an persian army that multiplied them in numbers .the spartans ` knew  that they had superior training in infantry tactics and that the battlefield was not fit for cavalry .the spartans also knew the geography that helped them hold the persian army for that long .in the end , the greek allies in thermopylai held the enemy long enough for the assembly of the athenian navy .hitler as another example , thought that he could capture moscow in december 1941 then return home .this was a miscalculated risk and the german army which was nt prepared for winter suffered dramatic losses in the winter of 1941-1942 , when it could nt reach its 1941 objectives .taking risks is a key to sucess indeed .but one should keep in mind that miscalculation and ill preparedness in taking risks is the most likely cause of downfall .
