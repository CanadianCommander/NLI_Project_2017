where i live , in japan , some people think that young people today spend a plenty of time to help their communities .i , however , agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities for the following two reasons .first of all , young people become to use their time for other activities .today , there are more attractive toys and instruments than before .for example , there are many and many games and we can use internet now .in japan , young people often spend thier time on playing games at thier home , a game-center .and we can often see young people playing portable games even in the train , bus or at schools .in addition , they usually use internet very much both by thier personal computers and internet cafe .so , young people are very busy , as they are earnest in spending their time in above activities .in addtion , they become to lose ability to have relation with other persons .second , communities , thierselves , become to disapper .we can live a life by ourselves more easily than before .for example , in the past , we had to grow someting and share many things .but now , we have almost things to live in our house .so , now , we tend not to need other peoples help and communities help .therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
