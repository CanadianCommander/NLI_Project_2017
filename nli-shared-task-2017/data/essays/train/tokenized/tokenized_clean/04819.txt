since the end of the nineteen century , the expansion of cars is increased all over the years .the need to move from a town to another or the pleasure of driving had produced a big market and economic system .could you imagine the evolution in a few years ?what could be the number of cars in twenty years ?in fact , the real question is if the cars will be fewer or not in the next years .firstly , we live in an economic system based a lot on the petroleum industry .the main energy of cars , today , is the petrol .have fewer cars in a few years would say we need to be more independant about this energy and develop other sorts of energy .the decrease of the number of cars will be possible only with economical changes and also policy reglementation .secondly , our road network is sometimes saturated .i ca nt imagine where we could put the others cars into the traffic jams .we can imply to build other roads .but this ca nt be indefinitly .now we could in this term have some cars additionaly but in a way , it has to stop a day .end thirdly , people are more and more sensitive to the environment .lot of them go to work in common transports or in bicycle .people had some cars but do nt use it in the same way than few years ago .the cost of cars are also a barrer , not only the aquisition but also the training on it .people do nt want cars or ca nt buy them .to conclude , i hope that in twenty years , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that s why i hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transports like bus , tramway , metro and so on .i think also that people are ready to change their cars culture .in fact it is now the decision of a pollution way or an oxygen way for our planet .
