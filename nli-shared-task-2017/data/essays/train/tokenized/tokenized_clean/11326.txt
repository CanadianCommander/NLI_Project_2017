i agree with the statement .in my opinion it is common knowledge that advertisements make products seem better than they really are .for verifying the statement you just have to think about what advertising is for .what is the sense in advertisement ?this can be answered quite clearly : companies use advertising to sell more of their products .consulting a psychologist or taking surveys is quite common nowadays for understanding what the costumer wants or expects from a product .companies try to fullfill these expectations or at least pretend to do so .they know what the costumer wants to see or have and they are more than willing to give it to him .so , actually , advertising is mostly about illusions and psychological tricks .the colours , the music , the script of a tv spot . ..everything was set up before .even the colour or the shape of the product itself .advertisements are often so exaggerated , that it really becomes hard to believe , e.g. whine stains on a white carpet which dissapear within 10 seconds .these are high standards being raised !one might say that it s the quality of a product that counts , but how often do costumers actually buy a product , because they had seen it earlier on tv or in the newspaper and `` just want to try it  ?i guess it happened to everybody at least once or twice .some were dissapointed with the result , when the product is not at all as it was announcend in the media .no matter if it s the quality of clothes , the taste of some new ice cream or the sound of a new cd .often , the product ca nt reach the standards raised in the media .of course , if you want people to buy your product on a regular basis you have to add some quality .it justifies the higher price and can convince the costumer of your product .but , nevertheless , it is extremely important for people to make themselves clear that advertisements do nt show reality , but are trying to persuade them to buy a certain product .
