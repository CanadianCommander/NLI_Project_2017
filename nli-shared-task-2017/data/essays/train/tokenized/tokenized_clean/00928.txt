i agree that most advertisment makes the product much more better than they are .advertisment are the things that tries people to think that product are very valuabe and makes people to desire that product .there are some reasons that advertisment shoulds be better than the actual products .first , advertisment has many variety .it can shown on the tv commercials , and newspaper , magazines and radios .those advertisment should be used in a place that attracts peoples attention by catching thier eyes .so there should be something which has impact or words that are very interesting .for example , in tv commercials , they uses music togather and some musics are very simple and fun that can be easy to remember to whome wich has been heared it .it is very important to been remembered to customers to develope the sales .so writing the point you want to be remebered or the point that is the advatages of the product , they should emphasize it in best way .second , advertisment is the biggest and easiest way to show the goodness of the product and builds up the images of the company too .to have a good sales or , being popular , or expanding the scale of the company , they have to be mentioned by large amounts of population .so to show the product better is the most important thing that you have to concern when you are making the advertisment .third , i have experienced many times that i thought advertisment has tricked me .somethimes there are advertisment that emphasizes too much and it very differes to the real product .but in another way , it is not a lie and the point wich has been emphasized are true .it it one of the way to sale things to people and it is not a crime .every company has their own way to win the war of the sales and honors .making the advertisment better is one of the way of making the company better .from these points , emphasized advertisment has no problem do ing so , and it is the way to intorduce the product .there are many advertisment surrounded to our life and we often see them while we are living .the customer can be easily find what we want in a small amount of time spending to search , and form the companies point of view , it is the part that has to effort to increase the sales amount .making a good , interesting advertisment is one of the salespoint that company and the product has to concern .
