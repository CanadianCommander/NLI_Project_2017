young people live better than old people because they know the value of life .while people getting older they lose their dreams during years .old people have got much more chance to do what ever they want but they have also lost their excitement about life .first of all , imagine a child , it always smile and play games or laugh .there is also a sentence which is used for describing the happiness of a child ;  being happy as a child .during the time is passing , years takes so many things from our lives .old people are mostly angry and unhappy people .actually years make them like that .older people experience more thing than young people .they also have lived more sadness .for example , when a person faces with a death of a member of his family , everthing takes different shapes in his world .because of that old people sometimes lose their willing to live more .on the other hand , old people can feel that they are aproaching to death day by day .they feel like they are waiting for death .it dusturbs people in a very effective way .on the other hand , young people have got bigger dreams because they have long time to do everything .dreams link them to the life more strongly .young people also do not have more responsibility .it makes their life easier to live because when you are free to do whatever you want to do , it protects you from stress and the things which makes you unhappy .as can be seen , getting older cut the links between you and the life .if a person has got no aim about future , it only makes you sad .aimless is the biggest enemy in front of a man .finding energy to enjoy the life does not change according to age .if you want to be always young , you just should dream because dreaming is the realist thing in the life .
