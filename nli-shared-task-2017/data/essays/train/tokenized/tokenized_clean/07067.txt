i agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead learning facts .as i am a student , i interest in experience something and learning from experience many things .such as for history study , i go to europe and look around real palaces and buildings and learn about renaissance and feel alive history .it is very exciting way to learn , however , sometimes i ca nt understand some part .from facts , we can get alive information and interestig things but sometimes we ca nt catch what we want .as we travel europe for history study , we should have lots of background kowledge for know about that .if we do nt have any ideas or concept about art work , we ca nt understand art work during renaissnace period .and sometimes facts make exception .lots of experiment that done from many scientists make exception .of course it could be new invention , however , the facts can lead scientists wrong way to learn about something .if some scientists did wrong lab and they beileve that they are on right way .however , it is wrong result .it makes confusing when other people access to that ideas .they will confuse at which one is right .it is also same at solve the math problem .so i think ideas and concepts are always be the basic .when we finish studying basic we can catch something fast and right way , and even though we faced with exception , we can prove it easily .for those reasons , i prefer that understand basic such as ieas first , then later learning facts .although i like to learn facts and enjoy the fact however , i usually try to learn basic first .and it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
