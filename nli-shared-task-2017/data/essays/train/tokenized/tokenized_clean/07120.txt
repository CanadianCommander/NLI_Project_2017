i disagree with this idea because i do not think ideas and concepts are more important than the facts .there are three reasons to support my opinion .first , concepts and ideas are only needed to be well on their school .student have to understand the concept and idea to solve questions on their test .but i do not think it is `` learnig  .acutually , it is `` memorising  .second , facts are the most important things in this world .no one can deny any facts and break it .we have to know the facts to be well on our sosiety .if students understand only concepts or facts , they will be confused finaly .third , not only student also adults have to understand facts to understand it s concepts and ideas .in my opinion , nobody can understand completely the concepts and ideas without the facts .that s why they have to understand the facts first .a lot of students are learning only concepts and ideas to be well on their school .by this education , they can not solve any irreguler questions even if it is using same idea as what they could solve before .because they do not know the fact for the problem that s why they can not enhance their knowledge .those students would be wondered that why they are using those concepts and ideas to solve their problems after they started to work on their major corces .i think , people have to know the fact first to study what they interested in .when i study something new for me , i am always wondered that why we are using this idea and how it is used to solve problems in acutual situations .to solve these questions , we have to know the fact for the satatement .from my opinion , i think the facts are more important than the concepts and ideas to solve our question or study what we are interested .that s why i disagree with the statement .
