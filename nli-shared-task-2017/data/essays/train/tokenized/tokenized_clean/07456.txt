today , many advertisements are in the world .therefore , i agrree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .i have two reasons .first , advertisements are cheaper than real products .it is because they are not real .in addition , they are easily to make them .if i could not buy real product because of money , i could buy advertisements product .in china and korea have a lot of them .therefore , many visitor to asia think that they can buy many of them with low costs .second , they look like similar to real product because they mimic real products .for example , when i have a advertisement product , nobody notice .paticular , young people in japan want real brand goods , but they are very expensive , so japanese young people buy mimiced products .they do not care about using them , and they thik only visual .for these reasons , i think that it is good that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
