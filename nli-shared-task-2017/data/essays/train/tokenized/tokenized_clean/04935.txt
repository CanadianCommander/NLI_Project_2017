i do nt think that only young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .it s depended on how someone s mind is .actually , young people have many things to enjoy more than olders have .but some of youngers can have boring lives .even though a person is enough old , he can be more enjoyable than youngers .the mind is matter .i m actually one of people who think that the life is boring .i came to the usa with when i was seventeen years old .everyone has said to me that i was too late to learn english perfectly because i was almost adult in my country , south korea .and i thought i was too late , too .i really have spent my two years meaninglessly , doing something like thinking of going back to korea .my common days were not enjoyable to me .but strangely , my mother is spending her life in the usa more enjoyably , and actively than in the korea .even though her english is not good that much , even worse than mine , she says that she thanks to have chance to move to america .before i heard it from mom , i thought that she had harder time than i did , because she was pretty old to get into new society , which is difficult to non-english speaker .however , now she enjoys her life more than others .she enjoys to make foreign friends and mail them more than people who are younger than her .happiness is not at only youngers , it is given who knows how to enjoy his or her own life .
