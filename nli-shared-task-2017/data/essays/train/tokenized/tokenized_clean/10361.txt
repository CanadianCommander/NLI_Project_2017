people can learn through different methods .some have an easiness for remembering charts , pictures or other graphics while others learn faster by literal means .the quality of the retention of those facts varies according to the way they retain them .when a student understands the idea of what he is doing , he can implement observations of his own .when one understands something , it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the details .he may even add new ideas .once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyze it , judge it and compare it to former experiences .understanding a concept makes it last much longer in the memory .we have a limited memorization time and space .for example , if you memorize your credit card number , you will remember it for a period of time .once you stop using that number , the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few months .our memory works best when we put to practice concepts and understand their functions and structures .on the other hand , simply learning facts leads to being able to hold back more details .you may know everything there is to know about a certain theme , but if you can not understand it , you can not change it or handle it .think of it this way .pretend you make a new friend .you may have read about this person before .you may know everything about him , from his blood type , to his hobbies , to his tastes , even his habits .if you do not understand the person , you can not deal with him , or even maintain a lasting friendship .to truly know that person you must not only know about him , but also know him .to conclude , my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain facts .when you understand , you have the ability to change it , experiment it and even handle it .if the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime , the best way of remembering facts is to understand them .
