i would have to say that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide but with more immediate friends and contacts .although , if one was planning a trip to go to a foreign country that is famous for it s sites , it would nt be a bad idea .traveling with people most likely from the same country with a guide that speaks your native language would perhaps provide a comfort and ease away the shyness some tend to have when leaving their comfort zone .but i do nt think that would be enough .my purpose to travel would be able to experience and understand the different and not just to be able to say `` i ve been there .if you only wanted to learn about a certain place , you could just buy a book or even go online and use the internet as a source to see pictures and obtain information .you ll be able to know how big it is , why it s called that and everything a tour guide could tell you just by reading .and i d have to say blatantly that that would seem a little boring , listening to a lecture on vacation .another , culture is a very important element .with a tour guide , they d be able to introduce you to important restaurants and stores marketed for tourists that sell souvenirs .with a little bit of research you could enjoy and plan all this yourself .so , i would prefer traveling with friends and/or family .if not , then alone .hopefully then , i will be able to make new friends there and also have the opportunity to hear the story from them , which is an experience that would be difficult to achieve in a pre-designed course .
