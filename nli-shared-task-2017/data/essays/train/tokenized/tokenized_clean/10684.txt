i agree that the advertisements that are widely used to promote products present them as much better than they are , in that they exaggerate the quality of the product and the effect that it will have on its consumers .advertisements present products in a superlative light .i will not venture to say that they decieve as to the quality but rather than they exaggerate it .well-to-do companies that can afford to advertise well are likely to have good quality products , but they are not necessarily as perfect as their advertisements show .for example , brand name cereals are presented in advertisements as the culmination of culinary excellence .at the same time , unadvertised products may have almost identical ingredients but less name-recognition .the consumer naturally assumes that the famous brand is higher in quality compared to the unknown brand but if he or she would try both they would find them similar if not identical in taste .also , advertisements only concentrate on the positive traits of the product , but never the negative traits .tobacco advertisements somewhatexculded , they will always make the product seem perfect and convenient and useful and safe , even though it may not be .toys and appliances , among other products , are commanly advertised in this way .the advertisement will show how fun and exciting the trampoline is .but if a customer were to try it out , he or she would find that it is very fragile , for example .this is another common way of presenting advertisements as better than they are .moreover the effect of the product on the consumer as it is presented in the advertisements is deceiving .advertisements typically reach their audience by showing visions of glamour , popularity , pleasure , and increased appeal to the opposite sex as the effect of buying their specific product .it is these hidden images that permeate advertisements and it is these that attract customers , however subconsciously .the truth is of course that these messages are flase and unreasonable .just because the axe commercial shows that whoever uses axe is irresistable to women , it does not mean that actual users of the product will share the same fate .advertisements are an effective tool in marketing a product .this is because they show its qualities not its shortcomings , they exaggerrate its excellence and uniqueness , and send false images about the effects they will have on the customers that use them .
