i fully agree with the statement for four reasons .1. if you have a broad knowledge of many subjects you can improve your knowledge in these areas constantly .if you are just good in one subject it will be rather hard to gain new knowledge in other areas because you lack the basic understanding of the topic .2.when you are looking for a job you can choose from a much larger variety of offers if you have an idea of more than one subject .given the example you are a manager and you know many subjects very well .then you can draw conclusions , that could help you solving problems at work , with informations from a different subject .cross-subject thinking is an important qualification for higher management positions .not only because of your intelligence but aswell because you can do smalltalk , which becomes more and more important in business relations .3. you are always an interesting man when you can have a `` chit chat  about almost every topic .it raises your status in society if you have a basic knowledge of lots of topics .4.your daily life can be made easier by using the knowledge to solve problems in whatever part of your life you want .you can use the knowledge like a toolbox for problems .to put it all in a nutshell having a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects is a base to build on and learn more about particular topics .it opens you the door to a lot of jobs and raises your status in society .the knowledge gives you topics to smalltalk about and the use of the knowledge helps you solving problems either in the job or just in daily life .i only see advantages in having a broad knowledge of many subjects .
