i agree that a person who wants to be succesfull in his life must have a broad knowlegde of a vast majority of academic subject .first of all when a person is in the process of having a coversation with any one he will have an idea of what to talk about during there discussion .for example if you were taking to your dad s freind who is a doctor that is specialised in the heart it would be useful to have some background of how the heart functions and its stucture .it could also prove useful as genaral knowledge during day to day activities .for example if you were asked to buy a certain product at a supermarket you would need to know how to determine whether this particular product is benefcial or not .this could be achieved if the basic knowledge of business studies is available to you .it could also help in your scocial life by allowing be to become more closer towards you .this means that you would be able to gain and select form a larger range of people to become your friends .being specailised on certain area sometimes promotes bordem due to every day repetion of tasks .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects also has some disadvantages to it .firstly it promotes unspecialisation in people since they only have minmal knowledge in a certain subject .it also resricts a person from having a job were he is good at and is specialised at .it also makes a person seem unprofessional since he has no real skill to give to the working world and society itself therefore he/she has no contribution .also people who are specialised most of the time obtain a higher salary than people who are not professional or specialised .
