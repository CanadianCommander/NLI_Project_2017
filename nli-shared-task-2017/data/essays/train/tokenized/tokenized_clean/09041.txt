i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .many people can think that older people can enjoy more , but i agree for the following statement .many people said that students should always study hard .i think that s wright , but not always .when you are young , you can learn more various things that when you grow up , but i think you also enjoy your life when you are young .students are attending classes in school everyday .and there are many friends in school .it is very important to study , and get much knowledge from your teacher , but in my opinion , i think to get close and communicate with their frieds are more important .some older people said `` i want to be a student  .first i heard that , i thoght it is very funny .i do nt know why they want to be a student .but i recognize that student can more enjoy life .many students meet and hang out together .i really like that .when i play with my friends , i can do what i want .i think enjoy life is doing something what i want .when you grow up , it s hard to do whatever you want .because you have your family .so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
