much of the traveling that takes part in the world is in new sites for the ones that undergone the trip .although direction of the travleing could beneffit from some expert , with some tour guide , i defenitly preffer not to travel with one .my main reason , is that i like traveling to the unknown .with this in mind , the use of a tour guide will ruin this fasination .two years ago , my girldfriend and i went to europe and in the airplane met other couple that were traveling to the same destination .even , we stay in the same hotel .they decided to walk freely on the streets , enter the places they wanted , go to events that the very same day were anounced or hear about , among other actions .all this decitions alowed them to presence very exciting things that happened in the city , and that make news all over the world .in contrast , we keep secure , completely safty , nothing exciting schedule of going to the museams and castless .second , is that i like flexibility in my vacations .it is enough the time constrait in my job , the unflexible schedules , to bring it with me to my hollydays , the time of the year i travel .for example , in the second year of collage me and my friends went to chiapas , mexico , to visit the mayan piramids .at that trip we were lead with a tour guide with a very unflexible schedule .this make us impossible to enjoy the trip because of the timing and the places we already want it to spend the most .after this experiences , i decided never traveling with a tour guide again .that is way i enjoy traveling without a tour guide .
