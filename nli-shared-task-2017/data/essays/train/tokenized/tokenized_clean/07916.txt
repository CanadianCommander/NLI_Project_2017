a good teaching can adopt different forms and pedagogic pathes , but the most appropriate way to learn efficiently lays in the method adopted , in order to understand things , rather than simply learning them .at the very beginnning of our scholar ` career  , we learn by heart a whole bunddle of things : poetry , multiplication tables , grammatic rules , definitions , and so on . ..but most of these learnings are ment to help us work faster without having to waste time in searching and understanding : this is the case for instance of the multiplication tables ( even though we know how they work . .. ) .all these items are also usually the bases to acquire a good memory and to enable us to learn more and more , always further .yet , in many cases , learning by heart will not be sufficient if not accompanied by a full understanding .if considering for instance the case of a mathematics formula , it will only be efficiently applicable if its necessity and logic is understood , so it can be utilized appropriately .an idea will be better defendable or criticable if all of its arguments are well known and understood .a concept will be optimized and well utilized if its functioning is evident and logical .moreover , being aware of the origin of an idea or concept , understanding its evolution and purpose , will help undoubtfully in its appropriation and memorization .it will help acquiring its own opinion or vision of it , as its entire process is known and understood .yet , other things will not necessarely need to be understood in order to learn .some facts can not be understood , or their understanding would be way too complicated , useless and timewasing to enable us to advance in a learning process , depending on what the goals of the student are .in this case , one can learn without understanding , as it will help advance further in learning more and more , which is the main objective .
