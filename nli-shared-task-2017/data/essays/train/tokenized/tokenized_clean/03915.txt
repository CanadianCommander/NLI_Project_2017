this essay will discuss the overall advantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject .i will begin by stating that the particular enviroment and situation a person is in does determine the outline of the necessary knowledge .since this is the case , let us observe two different cases where things may differ to a certain extent .first , i would like to consider a student who is a freshman at a 4 year college .until he chooses his major , he will have to start accumulating knowledge in many different subjects in order to have enough information to determine what he really wants to focus on .once he chooses his major , he will then start specializing on one particular subject .but , at this point , it is very important to observe that he still will need to be studying other broader subjects to enhance his development as a whole .thus , even the choice of a single focal subject is enabled by understanding a spectrum of other broader subjects .next , let us imagine that this student has graduated and joined the work force .if we simplify things for the sake of argument , we could have two different situations on our hands .in one case , the student prefers to stay in an academic enviroment and teach .to be able to get a college teaching position , for example , he will have to specialize even further on his chosen path through higher education .but , even while focusing further , he will try to increase his knowledge of subjects related to his own particular subject since this one of the fundemental requirements of becoming a good educator .on the other hand , if he chooses to join a company , the people who hire him will probably expect him to be versatile and function in different divisions of the company .again , as i stated before , i am oversimplifying these situations due to time and space constraint .in conclusion , even in situations requiring focus on a specific subject , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a must .this enables one to become a well rounded educated person with enough information in different subjects wh see the bigger picture whenever necessary .
