nowadays , only few people take risks .this happens because everybody to be sure that what they are doing will be successful .the problem with this approach is that if a person do nt take risk , the benefits are the same as the average .one example of risk are sports , the mayority of persons that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individuals usually not only win one competition but a lots .these ones are successful in reaching their goal not because they know what it was , but because they have trained to the limits of their body and went beyond them .this approach is the correct to success in life .this teach us that in order to success a person has to know what is the goal he wants to achieve .after that , this individual has to understand the path he has to follow to get this goal .because a lot of people should be looking for this goal and following the same steps , it is important to stand out of the crowd .this is where innovation takes part of it .persons need to know that even if is well known paths all people advices you to follow , it is important to also know there are other unexplored roads to take .in my life i have experience some situations that have helped me to understand this , for example , i had the same job for about three years , and i was sure it was doing in right because i always did everything my boss told me to .i get a raise once but never was promoted , which was my goal .so , after three years i changed my attitude and start to participate more in the projects , i got involved more in my co-workers  tasks and working more hours i they ask me to , after two months i was promoted .in conclusion , it is important to take risks to stand of the crowd , if you do nt do it , you just have the average results everybody can get .in order to be successful a person has to know that hardwork pays .
