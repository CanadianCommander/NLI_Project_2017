i totally disagree with the atatement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .two reasons came up to my mind .there have been great cars now , therefore , i have some positive advantages which will have been not make cars fewer in twenty years , .at first , what i would like to emphasize that technology has been developed very well in these days .i can say that it is also for cars , because almost every car has got audio player , car navigation system , or even system for talking on the phone when we are driving .everybody has at least one car each family and we can not live without having cars .in addition , we always use cars even for five-minute-walking distance in reality .it is so clear that various car syatems are developed recentry and i can not see why it will not continue in the future .perhaps cars will have got more effective systems that make us more comfortable to drive in .next reason is that cars are really important social thing for our country , japan .japan is known for making a lot of cars and when i went to foreign country i never go out without seeing japanese cars on the load .we often admire to make great deal of cars in the world .cars are positively one of our priorities so we should not stop making wonderful cars for us and also for foreigner who loves them .it would be foolish if we make ourselves stop making the great product or have fewer carsthan now .these are my major reasons why i disagree with it .i am sure that nothing will be able to replace cars , even though there should be such an incredible creature or investigation in the future , because it is necessarily for us for everything such as for keeping our social statement and great work .
