although for some professions it might be better to have a profund knowledge of their specific subject , in my profession you are dependend on a rather broad knowledge .so i tend to agree with the statement also knowing that there are strong reasons to think the other way around .being an architect my clients not only expect from me to make an excellent design which fits their demands , it involves also at least a basic knowledge of many other professions like electricity , pluming , wood work etc .so if i would just focus on skills concerning the design , i would not be able to meet the demands in the other fields .but then of cause i am also dependend on people who know more about specific subjects than i do like i mentioned in the beginning .there is an other example to underline my point of view .surgents often need very specific skills and knowledge about deseases in order to be able to cure them .but then it needs also less specialised doctors who are able to diagnose the desease in the first place and this might involve more than one field .but on the other people who are specialized can be very narrow minded as well .they do nt show interest in other things such as cultural matters like theater and art because they do nt know anything about it .for some professions it is even necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects such as buisiness man .to be able to communicate with others in different fields can be a very important factor for their success .so all in all i think it is better to be interessted in many subjects than just in one , it gives a a better understanding of others and opens up your mind for the `` unexpected  .
