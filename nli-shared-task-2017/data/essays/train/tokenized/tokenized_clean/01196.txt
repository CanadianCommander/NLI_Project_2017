well actually i can not say wheter i agree or disagree , because it depends on the situation .for example when i want to travel without my friends and my family i would propably choose a groupe led by a tour guide .because then you are not completely alone and you will see a lot of the country you are travelling to .but on the other side it is sometimes really annoying to be with a group of 20 people .you always have to wait till everybody is back in the bus and so you waste a lot of time waiting for people .and of course you are not as independent as you would be travelling alone .because the tour guide has his programme to do .for example i have been to england with my mother in june and we did not want to drive by our own and so we decided to travel with a group .but sometimes we really missed to do the things we want to do .because someday we were in this really nice village but we had just 30minutes there bevore the bus left again , but that was just not enough time to enjoy this .especially not , when the place you visit after that is absolutly not compareable to this nice village .so normally when i travel with my parents we do not travel with a group , because it is more comfortable .and then my father always prepares very good so that he takes the part of the guide and shows us everything , although this is sometimes more exhausting than travelling in a group .because my father has a really strict timetable for the things he wants to see and so we have to get up very early and come back to the hotel late in the afternoon .so in my opinion it depends on the situation .normally i would not choose travelling by a group , but when you travel alone it is the best way .for example i am now in australia and when my language course finished i also want to travel around , but i do not want to travel by my own , because i think it is comforting to now that you are not alone and will not get lost .so i really can not say wheter travelling by your own or travelling by group is better , because both kinds of travelling have their advantages and disadvantages .
