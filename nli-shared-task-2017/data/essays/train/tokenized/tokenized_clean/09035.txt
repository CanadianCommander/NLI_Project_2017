there is a belief that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i am not quite agree with this opinion .i think older people enjoy life more .there are may reasons behind these .firstly , older people have more money to spend .usually people save money while they are younger in order live in prosperity when they get older and retire .but the youngers have to spend money to buy a house , to get their children educated well and things like that which older people have already taken care .this is why i stated at the beginning of the paragraph that older people have more money to spend .secondly , older people do nt have responsibilities as much as youngers have .they have finalized all of their responsibilities like raising kids and working hard for a good career .less responsibilities not only mean more time to spent for enjoyment but also it means less stress .i think everyone will agree that a person with less stress could enjoy life more .finally , and most importantly in my opinion older people knows the value of every minute they spent and tend to look life in a more positive perspective .i want to give my grandfather as an example of that .he always advise me not to worry about the bad things , he says instead think things which are positive .there is also a proverb in turkey about this , which is always think about the full part of the glass while you take a glass half filled .in conclusion i think older people benefits from the enjoyments in life much more than the younger people like me do and they deserve it .
