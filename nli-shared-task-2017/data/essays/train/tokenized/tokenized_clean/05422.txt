in my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and consepts than it is for them to learn facts .i have some reasons to support my opinion .first reason is students can not learn facts if they do nt understand basic ideas .for example , if students are studying about world war , they study why the war happened , how many countries were in the war , what was happened afrer the war and so on .then , students start learning the detail facts such as how did people live during the war , what kind of strategies did each country have .second , if students have understood ideas and concepts , they can easily guess more detailed facts .for instance , students can guess people were forced to join the war if students have knowledge what is war .to understand ideas and concepts can help students guess facts .also , it is easy for students to aim their goal if they understand ideas and concepts .if students make some robots , they need to build robots according to the manual says , how to build the robots .on the process of building the robots , students recognize some fact that the robots  parts are need to add some oil in order to let robots move more smoothly .like this example , students can build robots because they read the instructions .if studets follow the instructions , they will be aware of more information such as adding some oil .of course students can make robots without adding some oil , but their robots might move slowly or even be unable to walk .in conclusion , i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because : to learn facts , students must understand the ideas ; students can guess facts if they understand the ideas ; it is easy for students to aim the goal if they know the ideas and concepts .these three are the reasons .
