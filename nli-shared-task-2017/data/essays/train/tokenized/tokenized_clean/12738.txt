the statement points to a very positive and successful tip for enlightment of every student s academic career .therefore , i totally agree with the statement .in the changing world of new upcoming ideas and concepts , it can be easily seen that the basic entity being very conventional .so , if this convention or initial model is not well understood , the whole further theory would sound unacceptable and hard to follow .in the later stages , situation of being in a state of total blank of the whole model can arrive .it will be very difficult to switch back at the basics at that moment because the course has taken a speedy track .neither the students would be able to cope up with the lectures nor will they participate in the interactive session of the teaching , thereby leading to a bad impression upon the professor .learning the facts will not only be difficult but also very confusing .there will be numerous facts that the student will have to cram up which is not an easy task to go ahead with .moreover , a situation may arise wherein the student finds himself in the utter world of contradiction , since he did not pay attention to the basic ideology in picture , or the fact that he is trying to mug up is entailed with a certain ideology very conceptually , which he merely ignored .the art of learning facts rather cramming i would say , is not a key towards the long term success .personal satisfaction is major point one should lay stess upon .naturally , it will not give innate satisfaction with the art of learning without understanding .an individual will not feel the real content of the course he studied .it will be very superficial kind of studying technique he will be adopting by ignoring various basic logics to be understood .the very obvious example to refer is the regular course or bachelor degree the student is pursuing .the basic idea behind every course of study is the implementation of the same in the real life i. e. education for the real world .a crammer will not remember anything , the ideologies , the concepts , the implementation whereas a mindful attitude will be a positive outlook towards basic entity of understanding and cracking the every problem faced in a coherent manner .
