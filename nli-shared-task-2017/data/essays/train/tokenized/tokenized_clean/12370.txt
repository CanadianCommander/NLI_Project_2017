i think it depends on people but i disagree that understanding ideas and concepts more importand for student than learing facts .i belived that there are some important points why to learn facts .people encourage to learn facts because of interested in really and to learn easily factinal information .for instance i would like to learn which tempertures does water boil or how electrity comes our home and how dishwasher does work ?moreover , i would like to learn basic maths to help my daily work .nowadays , young jenerations are very knowledge for evrything even children .they watch tv , read newspaper and resarch what happening in the world in spite of ideas or cancepts .in sort of information is teached people different way .some student maybe can learn easly idaes and concepts rather than learning facts .in my opinion which kind of necessary information we need , we can learn guickly .so learning facts are important for me and i prefer to learn it .
