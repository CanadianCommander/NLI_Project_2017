advertisements make products seem better than they really are , and there s a reason for that .most of the times , advertising is used to help a company sell it s product .in order to do this , advertisements use several techniques .one of this techniques is to make the product look as good as it can , this usually involves a lot of lying in the process .a good example for this are cereal advertisements .in these advertisements , the ceral always looks crunchy and perfectly placed over the milk , even though , in real life it eventually sinks and becomes soggy .several tricks are involved in these situations like replacing the milk for glue or some other , more gooey , white , milklike material .another technique is to present the product in a collectively idealized hypothetic situation .this situation is usually full of sexual content , either explicit or symbolic .a car advertisement in which a good looking , sexy woman is either in the car or over it is one of the biggest cliches in car advertising , yet , it works and continues to be used because of this .the woman does nt make the car better in any way , but it makes the viewer associate the car with beautiful women and eventually with sexual intercourse .this makes the car way more attractive .symbolism is another very efficient technique mused in advertising .phalic symbols are used for products directet to a male-based market , and more femenine , virginal symbols are used for women .for example , the use of fruits and flowers as a femenine symbol to sell beauty products .finally , the use of color .color is one of the most important things in anvertising .color creates an unconcsious reaction in the viewer .green for example , depending on the way it s used can mean extreme joy or extreme sadness .black usually reflects power , it s usually used to sell expensive cars to men .advertising , as it has been proved , does nt just make a product look and seem better than it really is , it s planned out to be that way .it is the beauty of it , it turns it into a form of art .
