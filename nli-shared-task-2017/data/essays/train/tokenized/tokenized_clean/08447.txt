advertisements are one the most striking results of the liberal economies .as there are very competitive environments for each good in economies , producers have to release commercials of their products .thus , either i agree or not , i will continue to face advertisements in everywhere .if i were to answer that question five years ago , i would have definetly said that advertisements do not make products better than they really are .i thought that producers do advertisements , in order to make consumers aware of their products .their main responses should be creating an acknowledged customers .although i used to watch some unrealistic advertisements on television ; i did not thought that they are cheating us .unlike my parents , i bought a number of stuff from tv commercials and dressed or used them happily .`` i love advertisements , they make me conscious when i am shopping  would be my exact words , if you were to ask me this very same question .today , however , as i am about to graduate with an economics degree , my thoughts are very different compared to five years ago , while i was in a high school .i had a marketing class in the previous year and i learned so many things about advertisements .during class times , we were analyzing some popular advertisements and found out how do they cheat consumers .i abhore the idea of cheating consumers .even the colors that they use in advertisements are intentional .furthermore , once in a time , i bought a pair of boots to my father as a birthday present .according to the advertisement , boots had a waterproove technology , and i believed .however , when my father tried them in a rainy day , boots eventually let water get inside of the boots .do you imagine how bad the situation is ?i felt so embraced that day .as a result , i can say that i totally agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
