many people have believes that young people today tend to spend less time to help their communities .however , i disagree with the statement bacause there are a lot of ways to help other people and we ca nt estimate how young adults help .to begin with , people can devote to their own society in different manners .without spending lots of time to work for others , they can dedicate themselves for the communities .for example , one of my friends used to be blamed by others for not giving enough time to help the poor .however , she actually did her best to provide helps through the internet .since she took a variety of classes at her school , she could nt spend time just during the day .after knowing this fact , most people felt sorry to her and regreted to focus on just quantity of the feasible time .in addtion , helping others is not able to be observed , it also ca nt be estimated by an objective standard .of course , spending time would be a good basis , but it never show one s all trying as i mentioned before .to give an idea , here is the example from kim-jun , who is one of the famous lawyer in korea .he are renowned for not only being successful in his career but also dedacation for the societies .it is evident that he has limited time to make multiple things at the same time .in order to overcome this problems , he has devoted for the community in various ways which do nt need to long time .he provided a huge money for poor people and no one blames him although he dose nt spend enough time .in brief , i strongly support that young people have still do their best for the world .they have their own ways to help others and we never evaluate their trying .for these reasons , we should nt overlook how they contribute to our communities just because they have nt spent a lot of time .
