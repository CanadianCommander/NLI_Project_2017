there are two type of successful people i think :the first one is the person , who reached the success with the own forces .this kind of successfully person is intelligent , quick , knows the meaning of the word ` work  , all that he/she has it have been earned from him/her , so he/she knows exactely how to do the job or how to behave in varies occasions .for this reason i do nt agree with the statement because i think this kind of person will surely try new things or take some risks to reach what he/she wants to or to improve in his/her job , because he/she is sure , competent and respectable .however in my mind ther s another kind of succesful people , those who reached the success because this success has been gifted to they .in this case the person has not the quality to be a successful person because he/she did nt work hard to reach his/her life s purpose , he/she does nt konw how to work well or how to behave in some kind of circumstances and first of all ther s the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he/she and this kind of people could crash down .i think they would never take into account to take a risk or triyng new things , because they know that in case of a big problem they would nt know how to solve it .they would of course look for the help of other people .because of those reason i agree and disagree with the statement in the same time .all that concern the choices of a person depend on so many things like character , ability , past and also a little bit of luck .
