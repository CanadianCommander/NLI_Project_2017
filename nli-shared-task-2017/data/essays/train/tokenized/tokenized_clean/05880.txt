since the invention of the first car , their amount has always increased causing a lot of damages to the environment .nevertheless , i believe that in twenty years , this worrying tendancy will be decrease .first at all , it will be very harmfull to the environment if the amount of car tend to increase more and more .that is why , in the next years , the government will have to take strict measures to prevent people from using their cars every day .there already are some measures such as when the pollution is too high , only certain kind of car are allowed to circulate .but , as far as i am concerned , the governement should do more and strenghten the law .they can develop public transport and make me them cheaper .moreover , the price of the fuel has strongly increased , and it costs and will cost more money to move by car , even if other energy are developed .much of people can not afford to pay more and will find more benefits not using their car , but rather public transport .an other reason makes me believe that the amount of car will decrease .indeed , technological progress are more and more developed and performed quickly .in few years , cars will be replaced by some innovations who enable people to move cheaper , faster and easier .to conclude , even if automobile firms intent to create cheaper and more ecologic cars , i think that news innovation will be created at the expanse of the cars .and in twenty years , the supply of cars will have been collapsed , and then the amount of car will have been strongly decreased .
