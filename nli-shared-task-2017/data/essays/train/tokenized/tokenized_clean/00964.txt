its hard to agree or disagree , but i go more with agrrement .i am going regulalry to the church youth , a place where you would expect young people to be paticipay in different activities of the communities .but is isnt the case , ist more like dont asjked to me help , there are 6.6billion more people on this world please asked them .i find it sad that people react like this in a time , where there acctullz able to change something or get something started .i said before that ist to find a right opinpion , i belive its depens on the activity. a work in inclues social activities , isnt the likelies one studens or young people .there are moen in to the sports .i personally know many , who are active in sports , not just doing them but also train the youht teams .and thant is a way of helping the communities .the much more intresting question is , why dont they want o do social work or activities ?why is it more atractive to spend the time playing video games ?it wasnt that all ages ago , otherway you could statment nowadays .there is a switch in the thinking , we are getting more egoism , `` dont bother me  .maybe people arent any more religouse enough , they gave up the christinanty moral of helping each other .nowadays we need is interent , you stay behind your desking and the whole world is in frnt of you , the internet , you dont even have to leave the house anymore , just order on the interent .i wnat to point out , we are loseing somthing social connetion .maybe a person who has lot of this connetion is more likely to spend time helping the cmmunities as whom , who just sit all day , cheking out the triple w. this statment has something in it , where you could say , as a inter-guy , i give enough time .chatooms are also sometimes called communities , in order to this kids help each other in sharing information about their idol , etc. school is place where kids should learn how to live in community , a class is like community , but mostly they dont learn , because there arent any activities , who give them the feeling of beeing part of a community .helping out ist mostly the kind of job , which isnt get paid , but money the stuff that keeps the world running , so i assume people would help if the city helps with a finicial plus .to close this i think there are many reson , but in the end they all have the same idea among them egoism or volunteer ( doesnt get paid ) .i hope someday we will recognize that a volunteer job can give you the same good feeling like a paid job .
