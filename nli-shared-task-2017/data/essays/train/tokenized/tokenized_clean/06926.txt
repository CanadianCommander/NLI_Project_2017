nowadays young people are more concerned about their ownself than helping their community .everyone is becoming selfish and mean .they see only their benefit and not the others .for them , social life is important till the time it gives them enjoyment and self satisfaction .after the satisfaction is over they turn to some other place where they have reason to go .when young people do nt find any reason that gives them some benefit , they will not turn to that side also where others want some help .i have realised this from my personal experience .once i thought to teach some students from my colony .specifically those who are staying in our neighbourhood and have problem in studying .i told my friend about the same and asked her to help me in the matter .she laughed at me and said she would prefer doing something which will pay me and will give more enjoyment .i didnt listen to her and started a common class at my home for my nieghbourhood children .i tierd improving their reading skills in which all were lacking .by reading anyone can go anywhere in the world without hesitation , can gain knowledge about various topics . .reading is an important factor which mostly parents and teachers overlook .it should be a general habit of every student which students dont realise in elementary classes .teenagers are more concerned about the parties and clubs but least bothered about the people around us .the attitude of is so rude towards elders and even youngers .we are educated and talented so we should take the best output from our education and knowledge by helping others .young generation coming up should think about others also , if not the whole world then atleast a minor part near to them to make some changes and improvement in the system .young people are the future of the country leading to the world  future .i do agree that young people nowadays donot give anough time to help their communites and this can be changed only if an individual wants to change .
