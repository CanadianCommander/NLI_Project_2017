i believe that is more important to understand ideas and concepts .i think so because it is important to learn how to handle problems and not to know everything .the first reason is that in later time there is everytime the possibility to look a fact up in a book .so for example if do not know a special word you can look it up and it will take only some minutes .so it is not very important to learn all the facts in school or in university .an other aspect is that in real life especially in work there are normally other problems as in university .so it is possible that you have learned all facts but can not solve the given problem .so you will not get your work done well .but if you understood the concept you are able to handle the situation and find a new solution .third the work in later job is so specialized that it is not possible to learn these facts in detail at university .for example in geology you can not learn everything you need for mining .the concept is the important point .it is also possible that a student will work after university in an other sector .it is today not unusual to get get a job for example in a bank if studied law before .in this case you do not need the special knowledge but structures how to work efficiently .finally university should give student the possibility to do researches on new areas of science .there will be no new project or e.g. a new medizin when only facts are important .through understanding the main ideas , concepts and structures students can reach new possibilities and goals .so to conclude , of course , this does not mean that facts should not be taught .but in the later life the structures and main ideas will be more helpful .so it is more important for students to understands this then learning all the facts .
