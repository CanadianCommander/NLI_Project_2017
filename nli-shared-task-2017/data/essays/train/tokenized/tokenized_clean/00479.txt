on the history of modern civilizations the question of having broader or specialized knowledge has produced many conflicts .mostly , the question is evident in the academic realms that implact individual thinking .a very brief look at three eras will help me to explain why i agree with having a general knowledge .the modern idea of having an universal kowledge , led to the creation of universities and educational centers where humanism , as well as other subject were part of a cult individual - for me this is a person with a broad knowledge .then , the classic thinking - as well as the constant socioeconomic changes - brought the idea of being speciallized in order to compete in a work market .finally , the balance aroused from the interdisciplinary point of view that suggest the combination of subjects for getting a better understanding of the society .in this context , i agree with the last one that promotes the idea of having a broader knowledge than a specialized one .even tough i accept not all of us are good in everything or have the ability of all fields `` know-hows  , i sustain a tolerant person is one who moves easily from one knowledge to another and who respect other subjects  complexity .i think this is fundamental for keeping our academies open to new ideas and to academic as well as professional collaborations that can result from interdisciplinary views .
