nowadays , environnemental problems are the road map of many policies across the world and in each country .the main cause is the important presenc eof cars on the earth , which are polluating the atmosphere rejecting toxic products into .several countries started to apply their policies to protect environnement , reducing the use of oil by public and private transports , and trying to find solutions to remplace the use of cars .however , the car is the most useful means of transport and we ca nt assume than cars will be fewer in twenty years .cars are well-knew to pollute atmosphere and to be a source of toxic products .to decrease the pollution by cars , some governments asked people to use their own car only when it is a big necessity .in big cities , authorities promoted public transports reducing their prices and urging people to travel by bus , subway , bike or tramway .many areas of cities became forbidden to cars , limitating the use of cars in pedestrian zones .moreover , scientists are trying to find an other source of energy to transports , like electricity .in big cities for example , we can see some bus which are working with electricity to reduce pollution , and the use of cars .besides , people are more and more concerned by environnement and pollution , and start to be interested by the future of the earth .they try to part in the reduction of toxic emissions , travelling by bus or subway in big cities or travelling with their friends to go to work ans using only one car for several people .good citizens make efforts to improve their way of life and they care about their health .the price of oil getting worsen , people may realize that it is better to travel by public transports than to spend money for oil .however , i think it is to early to say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .if people and governements are making efforts and are trying to reduce the number of cars , they remain a very good way to travel for people : they can go where they want , when they want , and it s free ( exept the oil ) .public transports remain quite expensive for people who prefer travel by themselves , in their own space , and not melting with others people .moreover , if car is not so useful in towns , it is in the countrysides and to holidays , because plane or train are much more expensive than cars .thus , i really think that people are not ready to rid of their car , which is their main way of transport .to conclude , i am not really sure than the number of cars will be less important in twenty years than today , because others ways of transport and public service are still too expensive .cars are very useful , and it is difficult for people to imagine their daily life without them .in the other hand , countries are getting more and more worried about the price of oil and are acting to remplace cars , but it will take time .
