some people may be called successful when they do new things and get success .whatever they do for success such as taking risks , putting a great effort , working continously without rest can be listed as a reason for their success .i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i stongly believe this .when people try new things they might face some problems .to solve those problems they should take risk for one or other reason .for example take a student who is doing his basics in maths .suppose he is well known with the addition and subraction and to go further that is to know about multiplication he has to take risk .this may include spending more time in studying or caluclating because it is a new topic and he needs more practice in that .and coming to a project leader he guides his students about the same project for years .he may find it easy and also perfect to in doing that .when he goes for other project that is new to him he should take risk in doing that .it includes studying the project , finding a solution for that , and to teach his students in an efficient manner .this makes him successful .i can give another example of a successful person .he was dhirubhai ambani one of the famous industriliasts in india .he cam from a village to city and started cloth bussiness .he got success in that because he know how to do well in that bussinees .but he was not consiered successful untill he tried some other business other than his cloth business .he shifted to petroleum industry and he offered a low price of petrol that others didnt give .and also he started a telecom industry and he gave the lowest prices of mobiles and aslo the calling rates when compared to others .this signifies the risk taken by him and then he became a successful person and also an inspiration to others .so doing the same thing makes u perfect in that perticular task but not a successful person .to be a successful person u should try new things and take risks in acheiving them .
