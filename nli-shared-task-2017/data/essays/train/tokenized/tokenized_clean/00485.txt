i agree with the statement of ideas and concepts are important over learn facts .with proper analysis of the ideas and facts one can learn facts out of them .ideas can form the basis to learn new facts about the particular area which you are about to know .concepts are much more important for the development of the facts .in real life facts about the life , its existence are developed by concepts of science .researchers are spending huge amounts of time and money to learn facts about the betterment of the life from the concepts and ideas that they got .now-a-days there are somany medicines and vaccines are developed to cure different diseases held with humanbeings .to develope these drugs concepts and ideas are basis for the chemists and biologists in developing these .not only in disease curing , in the investigation of a criminal case , investigators uses the ideas and develope concepts to trace the facts about the case .ideas are back bone for the developing new concepts to trace the facts .so students should develope to improve their knowledge towards understanding the new concepts and explore their ideas .ideas and concepts are just like fundamentals of a subject .if one with fundamentals can learn new facts in the subject using those fundamentals .without fundamental knowledge one can not go to the destination .ideas and concepts are not visible but the developed facts from them are visible as publications in the articles .many science and art publications are publishing the truths developed by researchers developed from concepts and ideas of subject matter only .these days are globalizing .world is comming out as a villiage .in this fast track society students with good concepts and ideas can frame their path beautifully .only learning facts can not develope one s internal subject .the student with conepts and ideas can go for research and develope new facts about the subject matter and can deliver to the betterment of the society .
