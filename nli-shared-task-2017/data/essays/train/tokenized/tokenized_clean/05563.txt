like many others statements , there is nt an universal true .it depends on many different things .a person who has broad knowledge of a precific subject can became very good in this subjects and dedicates all his life to it .but to know many subjects is more pratical .for examples , i m very good in maths and in scientific subjects till i was very young and every professor said `` david is so good in maths : he must do scientific liceo `` and so i focused all my attention on this subject to increase my ability and i did also the national math olimpic with good results .but now i have to pass this toefl test and i understand that in the past i d study english better because now i m very good in scientific subjects , but if i do nt pass this exam , how can i finish university ?it s a big problem . ..
