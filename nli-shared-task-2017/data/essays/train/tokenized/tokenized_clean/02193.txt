i personally travelled a lot in my life because i think its one of the best way to learn about diversities and cultures .since i was born my parents would often take me and my brother on vacation .i consider my self lucky because i had the opportunity to visit country such as venezuela , india , canada , brazil and many others .well none of these travels were guided by group led .from what i know a tour guide job concern whit showing to tourists the beauties or something in particular of a certain country , and i am sure that they do their job in the right way .but i think that one of the most fascinating and interesting thing when you are visiting a new country , i would call it the `` taste  of your vacation , come from your desire to discover the same beauties by your own .when i visit a new country a whant to feel all the tradition and culture that carachterize it , i want to become , during that period , part of what is going on .for example while i was in india i ve been invited to a traditional buddist wedding ; at the beggining i was a bit suspicious , i was not sure to ware their traditional wedding dress , it was a large pair of pants full of different colors .at the end i decided to ware it and still now after five years i remember that day as one of the most emotionally intense day of my life .in all my trip arround the world i ve been in many situation that gave me lots of satisfaction and i am sure that i would nt feel in the same way if was a guide who took me to that wedding .to end my paper i want to decair my adversion to tour guide vacation , you spend more and enjoy less .
