i believe that most of the products we see on tv or magazines are much better than they really are .two years ago i bought a face cream i had seen on the television and it turned out to be a disaster .this kind of misrepresentations are really common in todays advertisement world because of the companies aim to sell more product and advertisement agencies way of being more attractive .the companies represent their products better since there is a a lot of potential customers and they all want to take their shares in this large cake .these companies have great competition between themselves and they are ready to do everything even these things are unethical .their way to sell more product is to show their products better and they can do this easily since there is no control over the kinds of misrepresentations .besides the companies , the advertisement agencies show some products different than they really are .since they are in the business to make people believe , they create some ideas or images which seem more attractive to the customers on the television while misrepresenting the product .while they are doing this untrue presentation , the companies do not prevent them since it is for their advantage .from this arrengement in a conclusion , today most advertiments we see represent the better version of the product and there are still people who buys these product before searching the products really quality .i took my lesson two years ago and i hope everyone see the true faces of these companies and advertisers as soon as possible .this misrepresentation will continue as long as it goes until someone come and show the real faces of these companies and advertisement agencies to all world , but until that time i wonder ` what is next
