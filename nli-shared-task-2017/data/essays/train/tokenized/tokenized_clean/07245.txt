yes i agree with this statement .i think that young people have so much time to spend how they want .tipically young people do not work and they can do more things than older people .they can dedicate time to their hobbies , meetting some friends , going for a walk , playing a game or going to the the cinema .young people have no specific time that can constrain their actions .unlike , older people have it .a yuong guy can go out in the evening with his friends , going into a pub , coming back late in the night and if he doesn ` t want , the next day he can stay at home instead to go to work as older people do .older people , anyway , can have some advandages .the most important is that they have a lot of money that younger people don ` t have .with that money they can buy what they want , as : car , computers , vacations and traveler in general , house and etc . ..all things that can improve their lives .older people have a lot of responsabilities that young people don  t have .they have maybe a marrige to maitain some children to grow up .young people in contrast have more indipendence but is true that at least they have to respect the orders of the their parents .in conclusion i confirm my opinion ( that is the same of the task question ) : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
