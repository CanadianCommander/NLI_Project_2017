there is a general discussion today on the issue of whether the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .as far as i am concerned , i agree with this statement .there are several reasons i want to show you .first of all , the company need to make better advertisements to attract more people to buy their products .if the advertisements looks bad , no one wants have it .for example , the icecream seems very pretty in the picture or on the tv .in additon , in the advertisements when a person eats it always show amazing expressing because the taste is so good .from that , we do be attracted .so we choose buy one , but it always not as good as the advertisements .in the second place , when we saw the advertisements on tv or whatever other place , we may expect the real goods are better than the one they showed us .it is obvious that our mind influenced us when we saw the realy one behind we already saw the advertisements .that the one reason why we often feel the products seem much better than they really are .the thinking of long for the better thing plays an important role in our community .that why i believe this statement .i think also there are some advertisements may make products the same like they really are .however , the others which seem better than the real one are more outweight it .in conclusion , i agree with the statement that most advertisements make better than they are
