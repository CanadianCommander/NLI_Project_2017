i agree with this sentence , because if i do only the things that i know to do well , i do nt understand nothing of new , and i never grow up .in my personal experience , i took a very hard carreer for me .in fact , study is not my passion , but i think that today , in the world , and in particular in italy , the success of a person begin with a high level carreer of study .in this way i began seven years ago a university s course of mechanical engineering .i found very much difficult during these years , but searching to pass these problems i become stronger than when i began the university .but the risk in the life is to be too happy for the things obtained , and to think `` to be arrived  , and conseguently do nt see the world around us .i think that is important to never `` seat down  , and continue to do things that we do not well , in the way to understand alwais new thing and to make a better person to themselves .
