there are some steps for selling a product .the frist step is to produce and in tha last decedes this is the esieast step .the second step is the advertise and delivery of the product .advertisement i very important .doing something without advetisement is as like as blinking ti girls in the dark .only you can see what you do .but at this point the amount of the advertisement is important also .there must be a limit for these .because more advertisement means more money and more market to delver the product .the other reason is if you make more advetisement you must deal with much more people .firstly , the reason about money .advertisement is a money = needed process .for instance , tv shows advertisement is very effective but money for these is too big .newspaper banners , web page links , radio talks are the same of course .all these need money .because of these when you think about more advertiesement you must concider about your budget .secondly the more advertisement you make , the more people you deal with .dealing with more people means that you need mere customer relations and more thought to support customer demands .for example , colaturka , a new turkish cola brand , made lots of advertisement via all the media channels , newspapers etc .but whne the advertisements died down the custumors want to buy this brand .but colaturka could nt reserve the demand so the firm loose money .we can understand from this instance , we must get prepared before making advertisement of a product .consequently , advertiment is expensive and risky process .so when we think about making advertisement , we must think about our budget , the field of our product and our sources for reserving customer demand .
