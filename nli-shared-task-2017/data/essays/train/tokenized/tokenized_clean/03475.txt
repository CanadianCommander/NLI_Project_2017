the issue at the hand is whether the advertisements make products much better than really are .this issue is very important because advertisement has become important part in everybody life .i agree with the statement because they attract people to spend money whcih is offf no use .the first reason , advertisements are one way of communicating the inforamtion about a product .advertisements convey information about the product in a way to attract people by infering the false information .as a result the people who watched the advertisement tend to buy the product and comes to know it s of no use after spending a plenty of money on it .it may not affect the rich people but the middle class people would have spend this money on some other useful purpose .second reason , advertisements are important attraction to the people of different ages .so people try to imitate the actions seens in the advertisements which affects person performing it and also their family who depend upon him/her .this is happening because the advertisements gives only the advantage of it than explaining the disadvantages .finally the companies advertise for increase their buisiness than thinking of the people .for example most of the drinks like soda : are harmful to the people health in many ways due to toxic present in them .but they advertise these products with famous film actress or actor which attracts the people to buy the soda .so in this way advertisements will not convey the complete information about the product to the society .if the advertisements infers the complete information about theproduct the sales of it will decrease which will effects the company profit .now - a - days drinking of soda became a adiction to most of the people .in conclusion i think commercials will not convey the complete and better information because to gain profits .
