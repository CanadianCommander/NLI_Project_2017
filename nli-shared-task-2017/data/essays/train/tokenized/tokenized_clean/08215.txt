i agree with the statement that it is better for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .specialization can be a good thing in life , it helps a person to be good at what he does and be effecient in his work .however , sometimes if a person chooses to take many academic subjects , it gets interesting .lets say for example , a person takes biology , history and phsycology .all this knowledge is a great advantage !it leads the person to be more knowledgable , more aware of lots of things and also gives a sense of fun .your mind expands and gets different and interesting information each day from different topics .knowledge is a bunch of facts that you accquire from experiences and everyday routines .knowledge on one thing makes life boring especially for a person who is always curious and wants to learn new things .knowledge is unlimited , you have access to it anytime and anywhere .i could choose to know everything about one certain topic but that limits my knowledge to that one topic .but how about knowing information about different topics ?this makes you even more social with different type of people .a doctor who knows history gets people astonished .they begin to understand the fact that he is good at what he does but also has interest for many other things .in high school , i ve always chosen different electives like music , french and also computer lessons .i wanted to know more about each or even be good at them like in my major subject .it made me feel wise and able to talk to people about alot of subjects .i could argue and talk in different areas with different types of people , it gives a good impression and also makes my life interesting to learn new stuff and facts everyday .that explains why actors now are persuing careers in singing or being leaders of charity acts or organizations .they want to try more .it s better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .to learn different facts everyday gives color to the mind .life is short as they say , so make use of it .
