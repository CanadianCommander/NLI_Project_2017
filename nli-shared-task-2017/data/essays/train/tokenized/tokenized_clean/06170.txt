i do agree to the fact that successful people do try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know .i do believe so because of the fact that options in life shouldnt be ruled down to only a few .people should try exploring new avenues and try out new things so as to master the very aspect called `` life  .evolution , adaptation focus is the name of the game .when a person who is ambitious and an optimist tries doing something innovative he usually strikes or achieves a place where in not many people have achieved in life .today we thank people like thomas addison and james watt for their inventions .such things never came to their mind in second or two .it took them loads of restless work and patience and teh ability to cope with failure again and again to give us what we relish or enjoy in todays world a telephone or a steam engine .a mans horizon of thinkin should be very wide open .he should be well versed with his idea and should carry the potential for acheivin what he thought of doin .he should have a vision in short .a strong vision is half victory .people like bill gates never hesitated to put their vision on paper and his hard work , dedication , aim has given us a beautiful product called microsoft which is used by every one .his job never ended after he gave us `` windows  there were many other things that microsft had to give us and is still giving till date .u should try to be innovative in life trying to explore what all nature has to give us .risks are usually involved but i believe in the saying `` no pain no gain  everything comes at a price and u should be willing to pay a price .for example in india companies like reliance which practically run india where just a man s vision .ambani never ended his thirst for achieving till the time he passed away .they are till date trying to lay their hands on what all they can from clothes to elctricity to fuels to power the list is endless .according to me everybody lives in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that  i am different  and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it.  winners are not quitters  .life has kept a lot hidden there just needs to be a thirst for exploring new avenues and tryin out different things which can be only achieved by a good vision , aim and a very optimistic attitude .( go getter ) attitude
