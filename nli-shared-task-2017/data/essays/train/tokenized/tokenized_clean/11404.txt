at first , i want to say : i am agree with this statrment .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .this is a bid problem in the world .we must make a solution for this problem .we must do it now .why i say it is a big problem ?because if the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , that means they are lie .for example , one day i saw a ad in the tv which said somenthing about a kind of medicine .it said if you eat this medicine maybe one week you can be a real man .do nt worry about why you are too short , just eat this medicine , everything will be ok .you will not lose your beautiful wife , you will not lose your friends , and also you will not lose your work .then a friend of mine bought a box of that medicine , because he wanted to have a try .that medicine is very expensive , it cost about two thusand dollars .after a week , i went to my friends home and saw him whether he is changed or not .unbelieve he is really changed he is even bad before he ate this medicine .i was so sad for my friends because that medicine ca nt be used !at last my friend is ok because we took him to the hospital .there is another example , one day i saw a ad with a paper said there is a place sell tv and they are very cheap and used .my tv was just broken , so i wanted to have a look .i went there latter , the tv is very cheap you can only cost three fifth and then you can buy it .i was so happy so i bought one .i used it to play games and watch movies .and then after two weeks it was broken .i went to the company why it was broken .the boss said he had no idea !!i was so angry i ca nt say a word .these are what i want to say .everyone must look carefully about these ad most of them are not better than they really are .if you really want to buy one you must think a lot before you buy it .
