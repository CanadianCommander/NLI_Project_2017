i agree this statement ; sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .thhe successful people did this statment .i think they wanted to live more comfortable than before , so they are always difiant to every situation .most of peple do not try new things and take risks becuase they live contently thier own modern lives .i suggest two successful people who try new things and take risks that they wanted to develop human s life .first , right brothers who developed the planes as modern one .they already knew how to do well .but they took risks when they got experiment to fly the planes .they got obstacles to make or develop the planes because sometimes , the planes had fallen down on the ground .they gave their lives for developing more effiently the planes than previous planes .finally , they rewrot the history of planes .they were basical the inventors of modern planes .secondly , billgate who developed the computer program and something like that .billgate was genious guy when he attended the university , which is havard now .he wanted to make or develop the computer program because in that time , the computer program was so slowly and often did not opterate while the people use the computer .he got risks when he attended the university because sometimes , he got suspended from the university that he did not study at all .however , he developed computer programs that one of important program is windows now .he knew he did not make and computer program because people did not concern about the computer .however , billgate developed people s lives more comfortable than previos circumstance .most of people do not try new things and take risks becuase they do not want to be in dangerous situantion or circumstanse .but if you want to be successful person , you try to make new things and take risks .probably , you got failed much of times .however , do not be afraid that situation which can make that you will be successful person .the one proverb said the failing is mother of success .
