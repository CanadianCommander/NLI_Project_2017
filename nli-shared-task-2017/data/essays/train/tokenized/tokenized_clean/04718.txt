there are many movies about the future life which does not contain a type of transportation with cars .it is dispuatable how much they are reflecting correctly .but there are several reasonable matters which mean modern cars wo nt live forever .i meant that cars which run by petrolian by expression of ` modern car  .the biggest signature modern cars have to evolution is lacking amount of petrols all around world in near future .because , oil reserves are decreasing speedly .the main factor in innovation of modern machines wo nt be enough for future by today s consuming amounts .but there are another options to put in place of petrolian energy sources like water or any other material which can be ransformed into electrical energy .so cars  fuel type will be last , even it is changing now .so , in my opinion it wo nt be the main reason for there will be fewer cars in the world .as a second reason for there will be fewer cars in the world is huge improvements in sciences knowledge and technologies .technology will make car unnecessary or non prefered transportatioan vehicles or devices .according to this approach , there will be alternative transporation types for cars , like molecular transportation centers or flying objects ( flying cars ) .improvement in science and technology obviously show us there is no possibility to succeed the molecular transportation with today s knowledge .as a reason we do nt have a technology which transforms materials to photons and trasforming photons to materials .in addition to this , there are many research in modern physics which have to be accomplished for knowledge about transforming photons .in addition to this , we have never seen a flying car except jetsons  .as a result , i do nt agree with decreasing in number of cars in near future .because our historical experiments showed that human being is the most adaptable creature in the worls .so if we wo nt have enough petrolian  we will find another source .
