the fakethe world is globlazing every day and this make people to aware of everything that happen in casual .it is because of the communication through the television .firstly the television has a great place in people s life .when we come home from work , school or outside it is always in front of us and it affects us very deeply .by the television some advertisements can be seen .when something new was descovered that includes food drink or clothes its advertismenyts are always on the television and that makes people consider about buying that .it is clearly understood that people are more interested in the products that they see on the television .if the advertisement producers make the advertisement very successfully people starts to admire to those products .for instances when my family goes to shopping , they buy familiar things and those that they see on the television screen .i am definitely agree statement about the advertisements that product seem much better than they really are .even if the materials are poor for use the advertisements convince people to buy it and show them charming .for example last year there was an advertisement about shampoo .it was unknown and the its first year of the company .when i saw the shampoo on the television i really intented to buy it because it seems not only attractive but also popular beacuse it is known by everybody .unfortunately when i used it many times i concluded that it is only seen better in shape not in use .after that i shared that event with my friends and almost all of that agreed to me and now all of us are careful while shopping .all in all , as i explained that above , i agree the following statement .people normally cares the visuality but when they use it they understand their fault .to my mind people should be think two times when they buy something and they should not belive in attracted advertisements .
