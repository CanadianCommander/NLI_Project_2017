i agree with the statement that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .understanding ideas and concepts is important for students to acquire knowledge .once if the student gets idea of the concept he can easily understand the fact .let us take an example regaring this statement .suppose if a student has a brief idea of politics then he can understand what is going on in the present world and presenrt country .he can even describe how is it going on and what is wrong and right .i state that understanding concept is the main criteria of the subject or lecture .if a student understands a concept throughly he can score good marks and he never forgets that concept and ideas in his life time .this is the way of student to develop in his thinking and he can easily grasp the facts going around .ideas and concepts plays an important role in the present education system and present world .suppose if a person is having nill knowledge about politics it is difficult for him to understand the facts going around .if he dont know what is the concept of work and energy he cant understand the common day to day activities .let us take english if a student dont know the language and alphabets of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spellings .if a person has nill knowledge about a topic he cant write an essay .concepts and facts are very important in all acepts .if he just learn facts he gets half knowlege of the concept .he can understand only a part of the theory not totally and completely .so i conclude that ideas and concepts play important role in understanding facts .as great philospher said that half knowledge is always dangerous  .
