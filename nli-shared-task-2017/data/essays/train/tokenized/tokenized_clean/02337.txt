of couse , i am agree !because if someone undertand the conceps must undertand the facts .if a person only learn facts it will be only a dadta base , it will not have a logic reasoning or brain storming .in a part its important to learn all the facts about a subject .meanwhile you can describe it but , not analze it .this is extremly important to student , espacially for a investigation or a speech .cause undertanding a theme is the base of education , and science and many diciplines more .to undertand something , a person learn first the facts , them put on test ande theorize and finaly goes for a conclusion .this is learning exploring facts and deatails to make a comprenshion of a study object .for example the statement on my left view begings with a universal condition , than means that is a deductive ideal .the part saying undertand realiy means `` knowing everything  and the fact means `` knowing a few .`` it is more important to undertand ideas and concepts , than learn facts .the pasage cantains a view logic order , is almost undenailble to destroy it .not only that also express tan a student must visualize problems and solve them .in a conclusion the statement it s a invitation to kow eveything , to explore athe world of knolege .every student hope to achieve that in all clases and thinking of than i believe than i going righ way .
