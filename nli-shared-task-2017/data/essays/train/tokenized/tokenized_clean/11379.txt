i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i can not support this idea for two interesting reasons .first of all , young peole have less free time than old people do .think about the development stages of a human life chronically .when they are students , erery day is full of something to do mandatarily such as homeworks , tutorials , lessons .also young parents are so hectic almost everyday earning money , working house chores , taking care of chidrens and being social to survive the difficulties which come into their lives .just during the holidays they can relax and enjoy some time , then they have to struggle again after those certain times .it is hard even to think of themselves and their lives for a short time .on the contrary , old folks are quite often seen taking a walk , reading substantial books , playing golf , crusing on a beautiful ship and so on .second , young people have less money than old people do .actually young group make a lot more money than the other one .however , they have to spend a great portion of money they earned for a variety of purposes .for instance , a young couple with children have no chance to save their money at the bank .especially , lump sum of money is spent on their children such as child cares , foods .education stipends , clothes and so forth .there is scarecely a chance to use some portion of money to be used for the family vacation .that is the biggest opportunity to get away from daily mundane life and spend money to enjoy life including themselves .on the other hand , old generations are spending money usually for themselves .all the children are independent financilly , so they do not have to worry much about money as young generations do .most of old people eat out and make their lives even simpler .with extra money in their hands , they can invest to earn more money to use .i strongly can say that life is more beautiful when it is sunset due to the above reasons .
