today s youth is a busy and stressed one .too busy to interact with their communities and their surroundings .young people have responsibility such as school and afterschool activities as well as the desire to have a social life .it is because of these elements that i agree that young people nowadays to not give enough time to helping their communities .as a highschool 12th grader , i must admitt that the mayority of people my age to not have time to help their communities .school is a hectic responsability and homework is increased throughout the year .when i have time off , i need to work on future homework assignments or on organizing my time for the other responsabilities that i have prioritized as more important than my community .another element in young peoples lives that takes away from helping the community , is afterschool activities .as an avarage highschool student , i take swimming classes afterschool or help the student council set up school events .if i am not working for the school or for my physical being , than i am in town practising for my sats .i spend most of my weekdays worrying about my grades and my reponsabilities as a grade representative , than wondering what i could do to help the community .once school and afterschool events are over , i use my weekends to relax and go out with my friends .young people nowadays do nt really care about the community and rather worry about their own problems .if you ask young people what they find most important you will realize that their answer is selfish , in that it only thinks about themselves , because they only have time to worry about themselves .in conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities out but , it is only because we lack the time to do something about it .if our lives were more organized and less occuppied , perhaps an interest in helping our communities would surface .
