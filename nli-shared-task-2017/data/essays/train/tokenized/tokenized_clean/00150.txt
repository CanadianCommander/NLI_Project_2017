in general , i agree with the statement because i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more precious to people when it comes to their every daily life and surrounding acquaintances .in other words , i believe that a knowledge on several subjects gives people the possibility to better understand many matters which are facing every day like hystorical and political situations , foreign cultures and countries , scientific aspects and and physical facts .a broad knowledge can really help all of us in better understanding the world we live in and get used to that ; this is why , in my opinion , many primary and seconday schools tach basics of several academic subjects instead of reducing the range of taught matters and specializing students on some of them only .however , i also believe that , when it comes to work and business , this opinion is not longer applicable because specialization becomes a must .i think infact that a specialized worker has often to focus on few matters only and can not keep pursuing a broad knowledge on different subjects .being focused and specialized , workers can gain advantages in their jobs , become more competitive versus peers and colleagues , get more valuable to employers and deliver stronger and higher performances .an example is given by my personal experience .at the primary and seconday schools i have been studying several subjects from art to physics , from hystory to maths , etc. and so i received a very broad knowledge on many matters .after achieving my `` diploma  af the end of the secondary school , i specialized in mechanical engineering and then , after graduation , i started to work as mechanical engineer on some very focus matters , keep developing my skills over and over and , at the same time , specializing in some very narrow subjects .after 5 years of working experience and at the age of 30 , i can say that i chose the right way because i am very conscious of my everyday life and very rewarded and appreciated at work .
