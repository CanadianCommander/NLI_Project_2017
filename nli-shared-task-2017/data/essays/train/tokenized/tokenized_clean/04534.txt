the first cars were created by german factories at the end of the 19th century .this invention encountered a real success and , consequently , from this time , was spread all over the world .during the 20th century , the number of cars produced and bought increased considerably .however , since the end of the economic growth , thirty years after the second world war , and the first oil crisis , it goes without saying that the idea of reducing the number of cars have been taken into account .while it is certain that in a long-term way of thinking there will be fewer cars , it does not seem so accurate in a short-term one .some elements lead us to think that there may be less and less cars in a long-term perspective .first of all , i d like to underline that from the second half of the 21st century , there is a high probability that there will be no more oil .all known ressources are exploited and it is becoming more and more difficult to find oil .added to this , new kinds of transports are found and developed .to illustrate that idea , i can mention the new project of traveling in space .however , i d like to lay stress on that , to my mind , in twenty years , there wo nt be fewer cars .other locations from where we can extract oil are found .for instance , extraction of oil from under the ocean has started .in addition , the issue of the lack of oil is solved by the discovery of other sources that could replace oil , such as flower oil , with which a car can work .finally , i d like to emphazise the importance and the power of the car industry that lead me to think that there will be opposed to a decrease of the number of cars .for instance , the money spent on car advertisments illustrates their financial power , so that we can think that their opposition can be efficient .thus , in twenty year , there are many reasons to think that there will still be as much cars as today , maybe more if we consider the interest of people in cars innovations , through the success of the car saloon that took place recently .
