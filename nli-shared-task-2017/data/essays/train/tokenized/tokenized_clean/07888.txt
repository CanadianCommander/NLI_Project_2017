it is usually admited that young people enjoy life more than older people do .because of their youth , people enjoy life doing many things like travelling , going to night clubs , seeing friends .they often do not have health problem to deal with .they can make sport as much as they want .they believe that they have the whole life in front of them , that everything can be done .youth is the time of positive believes .contrary to this open state of mind , old people usually believe that they are too old for doing things they used to do when they were young .however , i believe that it is not because someone is young that he or she is going to enjoy life more than someone older .it depends on the people .we are all different and we all live our life the way we want to .as an example we can take an overwhelmed situation : a seventy year old person , who has many energy , who is open - minded and happy to live , eats well-balanced meals , who has always done sport in his or her life , can enjoy life more than a twenty year old one who spends his or her time in front of television as a couch potato , who has got neither friends nor job and feels unhappy .furthermore , an old person can have accumulate much more money than a young one .thus if money is important to live for both people , the older one would enjoy life much more than the younger one .finally , a sixty year old person does not have to work anymore contrary to the twenty year old one who , then , do not have the time to enjoy life as the first one does .as a conclusion we can say that it is not the age which makes life enjoyable or not , it is rather the people , their way of living , of thinking . ..in my opinion , every people in good health can enjoy life .last but not least , we all have different ways to enjoy life .
