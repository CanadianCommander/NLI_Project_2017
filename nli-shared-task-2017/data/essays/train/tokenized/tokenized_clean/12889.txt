it would be really difficult not to agree with this statement .everyone of us has , at least one time in his or her life , experienced a supermarket and bought something from it .it would be hardly the case not to have realized that a great part of the goods that we took home from that supermarket , showed to be much less satisfying or valuable than what we had been presented by advertisements .it would be too naive to ask ourselves why it happens .we all know the answer : producing companies stimulate and exploit our wishes and desires , about buying something nice , tastful or appealing , in order to elevate the selling figures and earn more .instinctively , one could say that it s an immoral behaviour and that it could also be defined as heavily cheating .the interesting fact , though , is that we perfectly know that it will happen and we are conscious what we will face , once confronted with the reality of the product we would buy .it s a sort of a theatral play , where every carachter has its place and role : the producing companies know that they will boost the qualities of their products in the advertisements , we know that we will have to reduce by half our expectations on the products we buy .so much for the raw , actual situation .but does this acknowledgement make any difference about the morality of this `` play  ?i do nt think so .i consider such a behaviour , by the producing companies , higly deprecable and , at least , a-moral , if not immoral .profit has the upper hand over trustfulness , and that should nt happen .but i consider myself pragmatic enough to live up with it .
