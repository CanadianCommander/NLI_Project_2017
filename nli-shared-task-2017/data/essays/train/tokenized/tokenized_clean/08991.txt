i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because for scientific work and for work in enterprises it is necessary to know much about specific topics .having a broad knowledge in different subjects is of course not bad and some basics about different topics should be known by everyone but it is not an ideal way of spending ones time to study many different subjects .when you know much about a single subject it can be astonishing because you will notice many things which you would not notice while only spending a little bit of time with the subject .specialize on a single subject means to get deep insight into the subject and not only learning some basics .this opens new possibilities for example in scientific work .to work scientifically on a topic more than some basic knowledge is necessary .deep insight into the subject and knowing the state of the art in science is needed to receive new scientific results .otherwise there would be a risk of receiving results which are already published , but this wo nt happen because people who do not know more than the basics in a subject do not get research positions .but special knowledge is necessary not only in scientific research but also in industrial fields .technology increased in the past decades to a large amount and specialized knowledge is needed to develope new products or technologies .the knowlege in technological concerns is so huge that it is impossible for single people to know everything and regarding to this having a broad knowledge in different fields means a lack of special knowledge about single topics .this means that is is impossible to work in developing products and technologies with a broad knowledge .a broad knowledge may have been favorable in the past but today it is necessary to have special knowledge in one specific subject .scientific research and developement of new products and technologies in enterprises are good examples for this .
