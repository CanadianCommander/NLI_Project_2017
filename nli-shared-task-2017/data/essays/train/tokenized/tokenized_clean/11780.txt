i have experienced both travel in a group led by a tour guide and travel by myself .some poeple think that travel in group with tour guide is better than travel without a tour guide .while , others have opposite idea .i agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a gruop led by a tour guide .because this is the most safe way and enjoyable way for travel .the first reason that i agree this statement is because we all want to have a safe travel .it is dengulous that you do not really understant the cultures or lendgrages where you travel .i read a news that some chinesses travel to malysia without leding by a tour guide , they have been sent to jail because they played ganbo in the hotel room .some things are not be a problem in our own controy does not means that is no problem in others either .therefore , i think that having a tour guide is the most safe way for travel .another reason that i think that travel in a group is better idea is because we do not have to worry about : has the hotel booking confirmed ?or where i can take bus for the place that i want to go ?all you have to do is just follow the tour guides .because of they ecperience , i believe that they know better than i do about the cities that i visit .like where have good shippingmalls or restaruants .i like to follow the tour guides and listen to them explain the history of the city or other interesting stories .this is also a advertage that you do not have by travel along .although there are some advertages of travel by along such as not time limite or no shchedule needs to follow .however , the advertages of travel in a group are more obvious than travel along .in conculsion , travel by follow some one who has experience is the best way for travel .expecially the place that you have never been .so than we can ttotally enjoy our vacation .
