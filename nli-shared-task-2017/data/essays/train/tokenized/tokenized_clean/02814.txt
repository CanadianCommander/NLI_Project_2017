advertisements can change consumer s mind about products .so , i think that most products excessively make use of their advertisements that are making products seem much better than they really are .for example , during past summer , i participated in western america which are lasvegas , arizona , and los angeles tour program for forigner .according to tour company s advertisements picture , we were supposed to accomodate in a luxury hotel that have a swimming pole , a casino , and diverse show programs but it was just picture .we were accomotated in like a motel .so , this is one of advertisements that are exggarated .when we watch tv advertisements , we propably can not find products that looks ugly and can not work well .however , when we use products , we can find the difference of the qualities .therefore , i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .although advertisements are very important to increase selling , consumers are not stupid .eventually , they will chose the really good products not by advertisements but qualliy .
