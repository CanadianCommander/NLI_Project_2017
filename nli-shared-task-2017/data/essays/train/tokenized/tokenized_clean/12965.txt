yeh , it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because it will help them to have a grip on the concept .studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student , the student knowledge develops only when he thinks on the topic .how he/she get that thinking ?once if they are having some grip or idea on the topic .the student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity .i am agreeing to the concept because i have a practical experience once up on a time .two students of my class attended to an exam with full of practise .i am explaining the practise module of both of the students , one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day with out breakage and also without any idea .and the other person who also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept .after they arrival after the exam one of the person who prepared whole night without any brakage told me that the question papper is very hard and i didnt understood the concept of the papper .but the other person told me that the question papper is very easiy to answer , i answered with in 1 hour out of 2hours .that much of easy the exam is ...he told like that i cant get first why they are telling like that , when asked both of them how u studied i got the answer for my question .on that day itself i understood that the instead of memorising the words we will go for understanding which will be very help full to the person to develop in any way .finally i conclude in such a way that people must understand the concept or idea , instead of studying that first we have to study and we have to understood , without that we ca nt achieve any thing .
