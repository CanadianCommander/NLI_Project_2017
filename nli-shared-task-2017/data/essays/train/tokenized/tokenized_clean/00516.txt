i think that are both important for the knowledge of the student .but exist different way to applicate them : for example for a kid at the primary schol , maybe it s better to understand ideas and concept , because he is at the start of his study career , so he need every strument to grow up well .with my personal experience , i think when you arrive at the university is important to understand ideas as well as learn facts .i m studing design , and how can i learn the topics of the projectation without testing on my skin how project work ?i m really convinced that theory without practise at university it s not so good , the same for practise without theory .i think like this because when you are graduate there is nt anything more between you and you work life , and work in general is more about facts thant theory .so if a law student will be an advocate , it s better for his career to star to comprend what the worker life will be .but at the same time students have possibility to learn ideas only at school , so itt really important to combine a good theory with a good practise .
