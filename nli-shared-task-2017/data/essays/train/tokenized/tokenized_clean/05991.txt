it is an old statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .in my opinion this is true for all the new old generations .always will be an old lady that looking at some guys going to disco will be agree with this statement .but , at the same time , i am totally sure that , when she was an athletic never-stopping girl , there was an old man telling the same to her .so things are !in my opinion , for the old generation , is a sort of criticism to the running time .it is quite understandable that an old person feel a little envy of the freedom and enjoyfull life s style of younger people .of course they have forgotten how amazing and enjoyfull was their life when they were twenty !on the other hand , we , the last young s generation , can not denay that times are changed and that our parents , or granparents , had much more resposabilities and no so many ways for enjoing their time .above all , nowadays the time to enjoy never stops : everyone of evry age can have a lot of funny .it does nt matter how old are you , if you are twenty or sixty .it is suitable for everyone travel all around the world , gain , or lost , in to the casino , do bujing-jumping , make news friends , go dancing , go to concerts or do all the crazy things you want .the age is no more a problem .so the statement , now , should be rewrite as : `` old people enjoy life more than younger people do  .supporting it , there are a lot of statistics afferming that old people are enjoyng a lot their retirement .
