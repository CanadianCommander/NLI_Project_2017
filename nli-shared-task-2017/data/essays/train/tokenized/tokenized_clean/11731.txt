i do agrre with the fact that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather that those who only do what they already know how to do well .first of all , the ability to try new things is a quality that allows you to learn new things all the time .by doing this , a person will certainly know many diverse things and develop open-mindness .compared to people who only use what they know and do well , a curious person will master many different things and be able to be really successful .for instance , steve jobbs , apple s ceo , mastered computers since he was very young .however , by trying new things , in his case selling his products he became one of the most successful man in today s world .i thus , strongly believe that this open-mindness was , appart of his genious , what made him successful .secondly , i think that taking risks is something harder than just trying new things .taking a risk has , by definition , good sides and bad sides .the bad sides are that you can take a risk beeing as enthousiastic as you want , you can fail .nevertheless , i think that risk-taking is a key to the success .indeed , taking a risk is the equivalent of betting on the future and i believe that someone who can not take this risk and think about the future wo nt be successful .of course , all of this is general speaking and each person have a different vision of what success is .however , at last but not least , i believe that knowing how to use what we already know and learn ing new things will make someone successful .
