i agree with the statement which tells that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .travelling with group is fun and having a leader make it much funner , because , usually , the leader is an expert in his area .travelling with a group led by a tour leader is better because you will be able to see more places , the tour will be well organized and you will not feel lonely and you will gain more informations .travelling with a leader give the treaveller a great opportunity to see all the tourism places .the leader will be specialist in that and will know the best places to go .for example , from my own experience , when i travelled first to london i knew hide park and nothing else .on the other hand , the next trip was with my uncle and he was our leader and guided us .he give me a chance to see the musuems , hide park - which i already have seen - , regent park and big ben .it was amazing trip and much better than the first one .for that reason , for the taveller to be with a leader make the trip much busier and let him or her see more places .also , having a leader saves the traveller more time and makes his or her trip much organized .by travelling with a leader , the travellers will notice that he or she always refers to a schedule .every tour will be prepared before tavelling .the times will be accurate and the whole period of the tour will be prepared to give the traveller an opportunity ti visit as much as possible of tourism places .as a result , to travel with a leader makes the trip more organized and more rememberable .when someone travels with a group which is leaded he or she will not feel lonely .he or she will be most of the time with the group dicovering new places as it is scheduled .also , another benefit is that he or she will get more information .usually , with groups , which are leaded , the leader gives some brief information about every new place they visit .that will let you as traveller to gain more knowledge .in conclusion , to travel with a leaded group is much better than travelling alone for some reasons .first , you will get better care , more organized trip and more knoweldge .also , that does not mean you will lose your privacy .certainly , you will have time to have a walk or go out walking .
