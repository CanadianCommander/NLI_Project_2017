in our daily life we encounter advertisement frequently .it starts by listening to the radio in the morning , continues on our way to school and does not end until we switch of the tv or computer at night .advertisment - that is so many things : billboards , tv spots , commercials and so on .and the reasons for it ?well there are two significant reasons : for one thing to inform about a product but first and foremost to attract customers to buy the product .in my opinion the majority of advertisements make their product seem prior to its actual status , but in our time of life it seems like it has to be like that .i am aware of the huge number of products there are for any purpose anyone could have .so therefore i can understand the marketing agents , when they try to get just a little attention for their product .suggerating an impossible result seems like a well-working marketing tool - if the buyers can take it with some humor .red bull for example : the drink is supposed to help you to be able to fly .obviously , consumers know that this promise is over the top , but when this drink first came to market i also thought this idea was funny and i tried the drink .or take the example of the snickers bar .in a recent tv spot the producers claimed that this chocolate bar would give anyone who ate it magical super powers .of course this is not true , but it is a humorous way to attract attention .the only time i think this kind of marketing strategy is not appropriate is for medical supplies .in my opinion medical supplies , like special technical appliances or medicine ( prescription drugs ) should only state the features of the product that it truly has .otherwise it would be life-threatning .to sum up i can say that most advertisements make their product seems better than it actually is .but in my opinion everyone should , if he or she is not sure of what the product is really about , get more information and get aware of possible hazards .
