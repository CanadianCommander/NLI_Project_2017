promotion has become one of the most common annoyance in the wealthy world .who has nt already been screaming against all theses numerous interruptions during his favorite tv-program ?many pruducts have been successfully supplied for ages .shampoos or detergents for instants .everey year you can monitor new features , new ingrediants and of course : new ads !i think ther are nt realy additional advantages for the consumer .laundry is as clean as it has been 10 years ago , is nt it .it s absolute the same procedure .moreover the variety of products increase dramatically .it s hard to keep an realistic overview when you go through the shelves in a grocery store for example .all the socalled improved recipies of e.g. yogurts .with colourful wrappings and slogans on it .does the most appealing advertisement really confirm a better and healthier dessert ?i think the answer is no .last but not least , an incredible compitition takes place in the western markets .everyone knows it .the most offered products particular according to our daily use are available at a sufficiant quantaty and - relevant in this context - at a outstanding quality .how can suppliers capture and enhance customers attention ?logically produtors are forced to emphasize the apperience and description of their suppy to attrack people s demand .i assume , to react at this methods is rediculous .in conclusion i ca nt agree with the statement , because most advertisements rely on a couple of reasons except for improvement of the qualitz .
