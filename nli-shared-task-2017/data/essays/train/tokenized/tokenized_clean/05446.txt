some old men usually say that with the daily universities guys know `` everything about nothing  .i think that this claim comes from this particular idea : courses at universities do not prepare people about a field of study but they want to direct students on a specific direction .in my opinion this is not true : courses often give a general knowledge ; i suppose that the first sentence could be true some years ago , but not today .however i agree with the statement in the above question .from my personal experience i can say that a broad knowledge , of any subject , is more useful than a specific one .a wide range of opinions , ideas or theories can allow a student to comprehend better a field of study .if you own most opinions about a topic , also you can build your personal idea and maybe you can also find a more peculiar interest afterwards .in this way , for a student it is easier to find his own goal .in addition i think that a guy , coming out the high-school , can not decide what he would like to do five o six years later .so the university gives him a possibility to make an idea .i met people who decided to change faculty after few months because , thank to this wide range of subject , they understand that the particular faculty they have choosen did not fit with their interests .nevertheless , after the university , this broad knowledge could be a `` skill  that factories or laboratories do not require , i am sure that they want people with experience , but here we are again , exeprience is something that you can achieve not suddenly in university , it is something that you can build working .a job can give to a student the necessary ability about a field that , of course , it is more specific than subjects that he has studied before .all in all , in my opinion it is right that universities provide a broad knowledge to their students and moreover i think that the specific skill must be acquired afterwards , maybe during a job experience .
