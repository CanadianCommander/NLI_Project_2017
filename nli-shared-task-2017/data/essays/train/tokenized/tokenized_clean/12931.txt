it may seem to be true that the use of the car will be decreased in some time .however , it does not seem to be right even in this moment .moreover , i strongly belive that people will take more cars in the future .first , there are possibilities that the rate of using cars will be decreasing .nowadays , the enviroment problem such as air pollution have become one of the most significant problem in our lives .where have such an pollution come from ?in general people mostly find the solution of the question from the largely increased use of artifacts , especially cars .therefore most governments considerably raise tuition for using a car or at least have plan to gradully increase it for reducing air pollution .besides such raised tuition , the restrictions using the car will be highly increasing as the concern of the environment increases .also , the fee for using cars will be larger since the amount of petrolium is significantly decreasingn .therefore , people might buy less cars to reduce such disadvantages .however , although such assertion is valid in today , number of people both who uses a car and wants to use a car is not decreased , rather than reduced .for example , according to chosunilbo , one of the most believable and popular journalism in korea , the rate of population using car has been even increased for ten years , and expertises also assert that this rate will not be decreased .how can it happen in spite of such a burden ?people are willing to have cars in several reasons above all such disadvantages such as high fees or tuition .first , cars are so convenient that people do not want to give up the car .it is clearly more rapid and free than bus or train .especially , moving in cars in such a huge country like united states is even necessary for almost all people .second , the car has become the symbol of wealth rather than just one of the most useful artifacts nowadays .more than sixty percent of people in the korea has their own cars , such that having a car becomes to be so normal .therefore the people eventually compare their cars so that there borns some rules rather than just tendency that the more welthy , the better car the people have becomes .such rules will continue in several years .therefore i strongly belive that there will be more cars in use than there are today .
