i agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do  because the young people will be more active , fast thinking , no tension about the family and the future and emerging of new cultures and technologies .firstly , young people will be more active and fast thinkers than old people because they will believe that `` time is precious  i.e .. , once the time and age is gone they cant get bact it to enjoy and correct the things according to them .but the old people will be very slow in taking decisions and theey will very superstitious .secondly , younger people will not have any tensions about the future and family problems because they will think that there will be lot of time to think about the family .but old people will think about the problems of the family members and they will take it as a responsilibity to solve the problems and giving good future to their family members .for example , if there is any financial problem then young people depends upon the old people to solve that financial problem and they will concentrate on other things which gives free from tensions .hence younger people gets more time to enjoy the life than older people .lastly , younger generation experiences different type of enertaining cultures and tecnological events to adapt to it and gaining pleasure and happiness from it .as the older people belongs to older generation they cant adapt the new cultures and they continue to live in the old manner .for example , younger people go to the different types of movies , functions and other entertainment technicques to make them enjoying the life and fell happy but older people cant show much interest on that events .so i conclude that younger people will enjoy the life than the older people do because of the interest shown by the older people , emerging of new cultures and using new technologies to lessen the burden , fast thinking and no tensions about the family problems .they also avoids problems by knowing the experiences of the older to people .
