tour operating is a developping and lucrative industry .a lot of people enjoy planned and guided travels for holidays because beeing discharged of logistics details , they enjoy even more their holidays .however i personnaly prefer to travel with some friends but not on guided trips for reasons involving flexibility , intense moments and rewarding experience .first and foremost , traveling in a group with a tour guide is not appealing to me because i fill deprived of my freedom to go where i want or to the most interesting place depending on the conditions .indeed , when you are traveling in a group , you have to follow an often tight or unintersting schedule that could makes you frustrated when you feel like there where breathtaking experiences , views or sites you missed .beeing in a group , walking with the group might also spoil your trip .there are some places like deserts , mountains summits , temples . ..where you want to be alone or only with close friends and share unusual atmosphere , silent or feeling that can be completely be disturbed by a noisy group of tourists .your holidays are a succes if you have been able to completely disconnect from your normal life , work problems . ..traveling in a group of people that have not the same goal during their holidays often prevent you from accessing the happiness of escapism .a last reason for planing and traveling by yourself lies into the rewardness of a successful trip you have been able to put together on your own .if you compare a trip for which your only input has been to pay and a trip for which you have been reading books , looking for information and then drawing a raw intinerary , the second one require more work but also ensure you that you will do exatly what you want depending on the uncertainties that are along your road .to summarize , beeing the responsible for your way rather than depending on a guide and beeing frustrated by all the limitations of a group , is the best way to travel .it enable you to live more rare experiences , discovering as much as you can without decreasing the quality of your experience .
