knowladge is eveythingi agree with this view .this view is it is better to have broad knowladge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .there are very unknow events in the world .it is believed that whatever scientist can find them .govermants are always support them .because if they find a solution for unknow events , humans will be well day by day .for instance , one of the most unknow events is space .we still do nt know aliens to be or not to be in our solar system .altough a lot of people such as scientist or resarchers try to find a solution for it , they can not a solution for it yet .also , the people who are scientist try to find a new energy source without petrol or electiric .they found h2 for cars or bus .cars or bus work well without petrol owing to h2 .in my opinion , one of the most important invention is that .in this way , envoriment is protected by people because h2 is nt harmful for nature .all in all , thera are a lot of unknow events in the world .scientist have to find a solution for them .if scientists or resarchers find something like a treatment for cancer or fliying car , people will be more healthy and people live easily .
