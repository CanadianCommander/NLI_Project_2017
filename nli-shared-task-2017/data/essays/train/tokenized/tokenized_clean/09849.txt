i agree that the opinion that young people nowaways d onot give enough time to helping thier communitues .i think there are two reasons .first of all , noaways , young people do not care about thier communities .the reason why is because , they do not think they receive a lot of benefits from thier communities .however , they receive a lot of benefits from communities .for example , they can go to the school , and can study because of communities .in addition , they are protected from the criminal because of policemen .therefore , they should cooperate with their communities .they should back what they received .second reason that they do not give enough time to helping communities is that it is increasing to communicate with prople .for example , there is a case that they do not know people who lives next to their house .in addition , recently cell phone is becomming very popular , so people can talk or communicate with people even if they met each other .therefore , their mind that helping each other is increasing .in conclusion , it is dangerous thing to increase the time to helping their communities .
