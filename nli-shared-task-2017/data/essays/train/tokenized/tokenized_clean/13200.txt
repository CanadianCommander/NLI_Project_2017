i think this is the main porpuse of the advertisements , make to believe people to adquiere their products because they are very useful , attractive or is going to solve most of the problems that are making you mad at the moment .but the real deal here , is that advertisements are a brain washer for everyone that sees them .in countries of the first world most of them , are very persuasive and make you buy that product .they use all the tools and all the media to get thru your eyes .the ads in the tv , are so colorful and so vivid that you realy like them and al last you finish buying what the ads was promotionig .the technology has become a real advantage for the human kind , and the big corporations use this , in their big companies to make this advertisements .everybody can see this on tv , hear then in the radio , they even stick big stickers in the buses , pul masive pictures in the big avenues , in the top of the buildings .in the bathroom you can do 2 things at the same time , while somene is doing they natural physiological needs the marketing is attacking you in the posters or even in the small tv screens tagged in the walls .getting out of the point just bit i believe the advertisements are a waesting of money , which only the big companies get benefits and none people that really need it i know that probably saying that sounds hilarious but it should be a law againt this masive weasting of money , we have to end the domination of this companies who ruled this world .is impossible that it happend but imagine if they save this quantity of money and with it give it to the persons who need it for real .they will help to build up a better world with better opportunities for every one .
