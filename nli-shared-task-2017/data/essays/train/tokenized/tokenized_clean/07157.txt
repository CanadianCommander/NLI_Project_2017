some people might say that it is great to have a mastery of a topic .i agree with them but i do nt think that being specialized in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reason .first , in my opinion , having broad knowledge of a lot of different subjects is very important .somebody can be very proud to have excellent an knowlege of biology , but is it really useful for today s life ?does he live better than his relatives ?i really do nt think so .i think that having a broad knowledge is important to live in a society .indeed , it s more than recomended to know about maths to look after the spendings , to know about politics when time is comed to elected a new president or to give an opinion concerning a new law . ..knowing about all these academic topics that pepole use to learn at school is then definitely more useful everydays than having a mastery of one particular topic .another important point is that some academic subjects are a guideline for people .for instance , history states the errors done in the past , and the persons who are aware of them are lickely to avoid them in the future ; generaly speaking , i would say that all the academic subjects help to live in a society .moreover , i wonder how can somebody evoluate , grow up with only studying one specific subject .all the topics we study in class enable us to create our personality .without them , it s impossible to decide what we like , what we dislike . ..for example , learning diferent topics definitely help teenagers to know what they want to do in the future .to sum up , to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than specialized in one specific subjects for several reasons : general knowledge is usefull to live in the world and it helps to create the personality .
