i did not agree with this statement .actually , i give more value to facts .i think without knowing facts , one can not analyze ideas or concepts .then you will only memory , not understand .if you really want to learn the ideas and concepts about sth , first you should learn all the facts about it .then you can be ready to understand and discuss both the given ideas and concepts .however , i understand the reasons behind this .as everybody , the students want get good marks without studying hard .that why we choose to learn only the things that will be asked to us .if they ask to write the ideas and concepts instead of let s say argue this concept or state whether you approve or disapprove this and that ideas , naturally a student pays no attention to learn the fact .obviously , he or she will prefer to memory the ideas and concepts about a subject and then he or she will get a good mark .that s what i have faced many times when i was at high school .this was the first reason actually .the second reason is that many resources do not cover enough facts , mostly they embraces the results or the consequences .there is not a chance to cover all of the facts .the students choose learn ideas and concept due to the education system .they teach us how to memory not to discuss .
