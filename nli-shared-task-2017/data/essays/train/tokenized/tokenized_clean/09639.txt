i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , even though many factors would suggest this position .even though for us the fact that cars exist is the most normal thing , we should not forget that they have actually not been around for such a long time yet .people started using cars in the early twentieth century , less than one hundred years ago .but what did they drive before cars were invented ?horse carriages of course .those have been used not for one hundred years , but for thousands of years !so how could we possibly expect driving something else than cars in twenty years already ?however , maybe there will not be a new invention in twenty years , but people will just use their cars less than they do now .perhaps some sort of revolutionary means of public transportation will be created in the near future , which will make the use of a car unnecessary .another possibility is that oil prices will rise incontrollably due to a lack of resources therefore causing people to think twice before using their cars or buying new cars .scientists and researchers expect the accessibility of crude oil to decrease rapidly in the coming decades , causing people to come up with alternate ways of transportation .some car producers try to build vehicles that can use a different source of energy than oil .so perhaps there might be fewer cars in twenty years due to a lack of resources .however , other scientists say that oil reserves constantly renew themselves , thus preventing their ceasing .in my opinion this theory sounds somewhat more accurate , causing me to reject the idea that the number of people using cars will decrease so rapidly .another reason for me to support this opinion is that people simply need and like their cars .some own cars for fun , but for some they are extremely important .for example , my brother lives in a suburban area of new jersey and has to drive at least fifteen minutes just to reach the next supermarket .this situation is not uncommon in the united states , where most people have living conditions similar to those of my brother .in big families , sometimes even more than one car is needed .perhaps the parents both need their own car to get to work and the children one to get to school with .in a time when families choose to live in suburban areas more and more , a decrease in the number cars used seems pretty utopian to me .some people also own cars because they like driving them .a friend of mine lives in a metropolitan area , which has an excellent means of public transportation , but nevertheless uses his car more often , because he enjoys driving .in conclusion , the possibility of a shrinking number of cars in use certainly exists , but in my opinion cars will stay popular and in use for a very long time , unless someone invents something completely new and better .
