look around you , there are so many successful people .they come in various `` shapes and forms  .the shapes and forms being , the circumstance ( let s face it , luck plays a `` minor  role ) , the personality of the person and what the individual is successful in .however , there is one common thing among all them successful folks , they are absolutely focused .they know what they want , and when they want it .they also take risks , something not all of us have the capability to do .they are no doubt good at what they do , however the risk is the key factor .people who are successful are inded very clever .they know what they want , they know how to get what they want .what makes them different from unseccessful people is the latter ; how they get what they want .risk taking is one of them .they are no doubt very good at what they do , this is what gives them the confidence to go ahead and take that risk .for instance , i play badminton , and the best player on our school team is successful at badminton .he is alos arrogant in his beliefs , however , it is his beliefs that have gotten him so far with the game .he takes risks while playing a match that is very hard core and intense .plaing with him is a very scary prospect because his stratergies to win are such .he let s the opponets gain a couple points , so that they become over confident and then systematically goes about gaining back point and eventually beating them .now , for an amateaur like me , this is anything but comforting .what if they become so confident that they actually are better than you are ?this question he never answers because he is convinced his theory will will work , no matter what .he is successful , i consider him so .he knows the game so well and he watches his oppensts so well that he can manipulate the attitude of his opponents .this could be an example of a successful person .it s his risks that make him part of what he is .
