i live in istanbul .it is a city that there are lots of energy due to young population .there are lots of bars , diskos etc .i mean , istanbul s social life athached with young population .this provides young person to an entertaning life .so , they love and enjoy the life more than older people .first of all , being young is a strange thing .you re slowly get in life , seeing lifes  good sides and bad sides .also you do nt have much experiences about life .so , you are following life , but you do nt know where it is going .in addition to that , nice and enjoying things are coming very nice to you .you are driving car for the first time , maybe you have your first sex experience etc .these are very beautiful experiments .you get exited when you do them all for the first time .these kind of examples makes person much life liker .at last but not least , older people also enjoying life .they are travelling world , trying to find new things and trying to find more exitement things .however , many of them can not finding what they are looking for because , whatever they are gonna find is familiar to them .this situation breaks their hope of course .in conclusion , young people loves to live .they are addicted to live .like a man says `` the more you enjoy , then you die  .i guess he is right , a man can not continue to get enjoy from everything in his life .
