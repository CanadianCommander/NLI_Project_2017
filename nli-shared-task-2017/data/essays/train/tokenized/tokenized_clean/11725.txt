the question if it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one particular subject is not easy to answer .first of all many academic fields need a specialisation to explore new developments that broaden the understanding of the related research field .this are especially the human sciences were processes become more and more complex and a particular researcher propably would not profit from knowledge in a field not related to his work .in contrast to that there are many academic fields were a broaden understanding of different sciences can help you enormously , as many field are interacting each other .the whole world is involved in the globalization process , so new commitments between people , countries or institutions are made , that had no ealier contact .business manager have to face new partners belonging to an other culture , that could lead to misunderstandings , if the people do not have the related cultural skills .from my personal point of view , i appreciate to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .studying european studies with a focus on political sciences , it is absolutely necessary to have skills in sociology to understand what societies as well as parts thereoff are thinking about various steps of political integration on the european level .this also includes skills in european law , as you are not able to archive your political goals without knowing the particular law system , this applies at east on functional democrcies .additionally , my economic skills are important as without their functionability the whole system would collapse , so you always have to take different positions of view into account , before making a particular decission from your own point of view .summarized i would say that it is dependent on your academic field to choose in favor or against a broad knowledge .on the one hand there are definitly experts needed to be sure that scientific process goes on , but on the other hand in many different occassions a broader understanding of different academic fields is useful to act securely in a world becoming more comprehensive .
