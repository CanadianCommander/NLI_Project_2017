today , we usually heard that young people are not interesting in helping their communities .i think that young people have a different vision of that .they help their communities , but in a different way than ten years ago .first , the structure of a family has changed .there are more divorces , parents and children can live kilometers far away from each other etc .i think this could explain why young people feel less concerned about old people for example .but we can see some experiences in france to reduce the gap between old persons and children .some schools have organised meeting , every week , where each child has a grandfather or a grandmother for the meeting .they play and make activities together .it is an interesting experience for children because lots of them have lost their grand parents or live far away from them .moreover , they learn to care for old people .in addition , youg people have different behaviours because they have different educations .if the parents teach their children to help other people , i think they would follow this lesson later .if they see parents helping a neighbour or someome of the family for example .another point is that the current society and parents ask a lot from young people .there is a lot of competition between parents because they want to show that their children are `` better  than others in school , sport , music , etc .this mean that children have lots of activites during the week and the week end so they have less time to spend for their communities .finally , i think that young people help their communities but they could give more time for it .parents have to teach children that family and community are important and that they have to take care of each other .
