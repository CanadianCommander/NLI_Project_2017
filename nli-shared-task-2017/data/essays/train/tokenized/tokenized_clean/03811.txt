yes i do agree with the statement above that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisement was created whenever business was first developed .to be able to sell a product , first of all , a salesman must show you an exceptional image that pairs with the product .for instance , a brand of make-up product commercial on tv would have the most beautiful model you have ever seen just to attract your attention , the point is to brainwash people s minds and make them believe that buying this product would make them look exactly like the models on the advertisement .secondly , a salesman must show you how good the product is , for another example , a type of fast food company would show you how big and juicy their burger is by making one abnormal large size of burger to appeal on the advertisement to send a message to people that the majority of their burgers  size are just like that .finally comes to the joke-type advertisement .most people fall for funny commercials , humors make a different in people s opinion about the product .just like there are two guys , one is funny , one is dull , which one would you be friends with ?advertisement took the advantage and tried to make their commercial funny so it attracts people .they no longer need to lie , no longer need to make fake images or pay top models , all they need to come up with is a funny idea and apply it into a commercial , such as the body spray company .it smells good , fact .it attracts women , semi-fact .all they need to do now is to make it funny and attract most young adults to buy their product .they are getting better at advertising every year , but the truth is , advertisements will always make products seem much better than they really are ,
