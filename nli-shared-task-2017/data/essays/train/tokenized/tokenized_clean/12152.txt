being an experienced person is always good , not only will it help you in life but it also proves that you are not an ignorant .having a broad knowledge over many topics is necesary in a world like today ; this is why we have many subjects to be studied both in school and university .though this is not enough in a society like today s .to be succesful it is necessary for people to specialize on a certain topic of their choice .without majoring and becoming a profesional on a subject your chances of having a good life now a day is scarce .people consider that studying is one of the most essential parts in life which is necessary for having a good and secure future .personally agreeing in the matter i am experiencing something similar .as a high school senior applications is something that you must do to continue with your education .being accepted into college is wonderful and necessary to secure a good future not only for yourself but for your upcoming family .what is difficult is to decide what you want to study , as the world becomes more competitve , you also want to study something you like .everyone knows that in a university you will not only study the subject of your choice but you will also be taking many other basic courses .having a broad knowledge over things is necessary and that is why colleges and universities obligate you to learn other material .emphazising on your specific major is also a must and that is why most colleges and universities recommend declaring a major as soon as possible .being a profesional in a world like today is something we have learned to look forward to .increasing your knowledge is what most people really want but to do this one must study .sadly having an extensive knowledge isnt enough to prosper in this world and that is why one must also specialize in a determined subject .
