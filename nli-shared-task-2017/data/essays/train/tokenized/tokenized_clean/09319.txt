many people believe that succeeding in a specific subject will result to the success in one s career .this is not the case , however .i believe it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to succeed in life .knowledge is crucial , so knowing more is always better .examples of my opinion can be found in everyday situations .first of all , in school , all-round students get better grades overall than students who do well in one subject and not so well in the rest .in fact , schools promote that students should be aware of all subjects .the students will then use the concepts they learn in school for real-life purposes .gaining more knowledge from different academic subjects results in a better understanding of different perspectives .for example , if a student plans to go into business , he or she must learn the mandatory courses such as marketing and economics .however , mastering in those courses does not guarantee that the student will become a successful businessman or businesswoman .if the student has a broad knowledge of other academic subjects such as psychology or mathematics , he or she will know more about why a business succeeds or not and how to prevent a business from failing .though these courses are very different , knowing the general concepts will aid the student as it gives him or her different approaches and perspectives .another example is if a student wants to become a doctor .finishing medical school is just one step in becoming successful .if the student does nt know the basic concepts of how to set up a clinic , then how will he or she perform his or her practices ?again , business and medicine are very different subjects , but knowing both results to better success .in conclusion , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .students are lucky to study many subjects in school because not only will they be aware of more perspectives , they can utilize all concepts in real life situations .more knowledge leads to more success .
