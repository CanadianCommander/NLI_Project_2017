all days we take car to go at work , take train to transfer from a city to another , buy various type of electronic machine , on all of this actions we can watch a million of danger situations !on the train we can read uppon the window that is very danderous put out the head or put out bottles , during drive car we can watch many traffic signals that remember the maximum speed permitted , or finally when we buy a washing-machine we can read the book where are write all instruction to what do and what do not .this are the advertisements that daily we can find in the life .just when we are child , parents show what is dangerous for us , `` do not touch this  is the mainly phrase that it is said .during the grow each child decide what is right for him and , sometime to follow the fashion , make bad decision for himself like smoching cigarettes and joints , or go around with not very good people .sometimes an advertisement could seem very eccessive , like how do not put a cat in the microwaves , but not all people are able to think what is right and what is not .i think that it is impossible know whether a person is able to choose the true way to make somethingh , and so it is better if other write sample instructions for him  her .finally i definitely disagree the statement because we can not know when and what is really dangerous for us , and so i think that is better follow the instruction .
