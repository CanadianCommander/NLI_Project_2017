i do not think that it is always the case that young people enjoy life more than older people do .for example teenagers live at that age a very traumatic period of their lives and normally they hate themselves , hate others , hate their lives , hate everything !so i definitely do not thing that they enjoy life more than others do .young people take risks , i think that is the difference , they want to explore , know , achieve things and sometimes they take their lives for granted .yes , sometimes it is true that young people know how to have more fun unlike some older individuals but it does not mean that it is always like that .older people have experience , know more about some things , about how life is and i think that the more you know , the more you have experienced life , the more you value things , you stop taking things for granted and give them the right value , you appreciate more because it has taken a lot of effort in order for you to have what you have .they can enjoy life more simply because they have more memories , either happy or sad but they have them , memories that enrich their everyday life , they have more people to love , more stories to tell , they have lived more .how would you enjoy life at the most if you have not lived enough ?if you do not really know how life is ?of course there are cases in which older people are bitter , angry at life because they have suffered a lot but that does not mean that more experienced people can not enjoy their lives as much or even more than unexperienced persons .it all depends on the way of life you have , how grateful you are , how much love you have given and received , what you have learned in life , etc .it is definitely not a matter of age , it is more likely , i think , a matter of personality and the circumstances that surround or have surrounded your life .
