in the world , there is so many people who is successful .i believe that they succeed becuse they tryed todo new things and take risk is makes people to succeed .first , if peolple do only what they already know how to well , they will not improve .we have to make an effort and charenge new things to improve .there is so many people who know how to do well the things .it means there is so many people who have same ability as them .therefore , people without challensing are same as others and they will not success .second , to try new things and to take risk make us to know how to solve the problems .as people try to start new things , they will expect the problems that will be happend .since people know what problem will be happened , they can prepare to have the problems and find how to make it better before problem happen .if people do only what they already know , they will not think about faillur .so if some problems occurs to them , it is hard to solve the problems .also once they gat some problems , they will depress more easily than those who expected what problems will be able to occure .becauser of these reasons , i belive that to try new things and take risks are more important than to do what they already know how to do well for success .
