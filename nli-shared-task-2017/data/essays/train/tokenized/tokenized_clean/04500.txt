i agree that to have broad knowlege of many academic is better than to specialize in one specific subject .i have two reason why i agree this opinion : the goal of education and feature of modern society .first of all , the goal of education makes a good person who is adapted the society .to make a good person , the school teaches many academic subjects .because the person must study the many academic subjects , he would be adapted the society .for example , two high schools in korea had another curiculums .the one had many academic subject in curiculum , and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum .which high school s students were succeeded ?answer is the former .also , the modern society wants to multipalyer who performs various tasks .as one might expected , to specilize in one specific skill is better than to have broad skill of various field .however , this society make a multiplayer .in my experience , i work my company which has many tasks .because i do nt have no various academic knowledge , i can not promote the manger first time .it is commly belived that to specilize in specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .but , this opnion is not available nowadays .to know many things is allowed to victory the competitions .
