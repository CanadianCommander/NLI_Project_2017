this question is complex and appears very frequently in the world of education .this essay will consider why it is necessary to have broad knowledges and why experts in some subjects are also very important .firstly , lots of academics subjects required knowledges to be well udestood .for example , how can you learn physics if you are not very good in mathematics .therefore , you always need to learn a broad range of academic .moreover , studying those subject is often not enough , you need to practise them .for example , let s assumed that a student works in a biological laboratory , he will of course use some chemical methots .how can he cope wtih that if does not have basic knowledge in chemistery ?secondly , lots of current domain are between two subjects .i m thinking about biochemistry for example .to learn such a bject , basic chemistry and biology are required .however , it is obvious that nobody is able to know everything .even one academic subject is too broad and is divided in different parts .for example , chemistery includes organic chemistry , biochemistry , ...because of the amount of knowledge , sometimes , it is important to choose .it is impossible to become an expert in every academic subjects .therefore , to make research in any subject , we need some experts .to continue with my scientific examples , how can a scientist be at the cutting-edge if he is not specialized .to conclude , i think that learning should be divided in two steps .the first step would give knowledgs in a lots of topics and the second step would concentrate in one specific subject .
