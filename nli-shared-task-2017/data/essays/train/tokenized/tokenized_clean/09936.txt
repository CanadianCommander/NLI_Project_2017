in this era of modernisation , where man has reached space , developed nuclear arms and made other tremendous progress , the time is more in favour of a specialist .though a general knowledge about basic subjects is essential the indepth knowledge of specific subject is mostly required .the curriculum of a school is so devised as to teach the growing child the basic subjects like english , science , mathematics , social studies , moral education and so on .as the child grows a stage comes when he has to choose the subject he would like to specialize .in college the students are required to opt for a subject as their major area of study .he has to choose his career .nobody would disagree that there is not much of use of literature and economics if a person wishes to be a doctor or other science major .similarly the persons opting for business need not care about studying biology .being a medical graduate i understand that today the world is in favour of specialist .a person if he has contracted a disease goes first to his general practitioner who tries to manage the case but if the case is not recovering with his treatment he refers it to a specialist .thus the specialist looks into the problem and treats effectively .the specialist sometimes may face problem as he has to deal with a case who has disease in many organ systems thus he has to take the help of other specialists .the need of broad knowledge about many subjects may help in securin good positions in quiz , exams .there are some jobs , that require knowledge in many subject , like teaching school children , taking care of librariesetc .but on the whole most of the jobs require the knowledge of a specific subject .in conclusion i believe that it is better to have indepth knowledge of a specific subject than broader about many subject as one should not be `` jack of all trades but master of none  .
