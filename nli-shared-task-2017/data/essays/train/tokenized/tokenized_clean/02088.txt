in my opinion i can not really agree or disagree with the statement `` succesful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well .for example , it is always necessary to do things which i really know are good and how i have to do them .i can not open a design agency if i do not know how to work with colours , arts , signs or types .that are necessary and elemantary topics for a designer .but if my agency works good , i could try some risks .for example , i could try to achieve new goals .this does not work without some risks .when i first only coloured books and invented new corporate designs for other firms , and now i want to offer a new part of design , the imagefilm , it includes a lot of risks .i have to ask me some things : `` do i have enough money for the new equipment ?am i able to handle with the new topic ?  or  will i have people wanting pay me for my work ?this are all risks and the topic is a new thing for me .but i could really be succesfull , maybe i have a great talent in making film .and new ideas are going to be searched .it could be , that i have not many limits in my mind about this topic and i could try mostly everything .this would be a new way for me and my agency .and if colouring books and making new corporate designs are things which worked good before , they are the basis for new things and risks .and i can be sure that i have things which are able to allow me the new risks .that is why , i think you need both to be succesfull , first you should have knowledge which you already know to handle and then you can try new things amd take risks .this would be a very good combination for beeing a succesfull people .
