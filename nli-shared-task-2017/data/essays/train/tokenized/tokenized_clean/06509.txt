as the maxim stands `` nothing succeeds like success  , holds true in either case , whether an individual takes risk and becomes successful or he does not take risk and still turns out out to be successful .in my opinion , success is about taking risks and rather than only doing what they already know .thus , i agree to the given statement .in my opinion people do become successful even when they adopt the old opinion but by doing that , ther are not the leaders in the society but followers .for example , a company x opened chain resturants and decided to franchise its resturants .the company x was successfull .company y decides to follow the the foot prints of company x and did not try anything different .company y may be successful in the long run but may not a leader while as company x is a leader and other organisations will follow him .same is true with the individuals .secondly , by not taking risks , people always live in shells .they lack creativity to do some thing different and their potential as an individual is not absolutely harnassed .take the example of director steven speilsberg .when he was working on his movie `` titanic  , most people though he was doing impossible and would not succeed .we all know what happened after that .changes in any field are inevitable .an individual who is stuck to his old thoughts and do only that what he / she knows , may not respond in an optimum way when changes warrant different .the individual may not be able to cope to the changes and thus may turn out to be a failure .last but not the least , the success involved in trying new things and taking risk is fast .an individual may be successful in trying only what they already know but it may involve lot of time .if the individual wants the output to be positive and quick , he may need to take risk at any stage of life .to conclude , risk taking ability is an essential quality of an individual to succeed .howver , he or she should not get carried away with the amount of risk one is taking .they should measure the risk benefit ratio before taking risk and thus finally decide if it is worth it to take the risk to be successful .
