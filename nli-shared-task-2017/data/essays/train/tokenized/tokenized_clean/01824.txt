yes , i agree from the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .there is a saying that `` practise makes man perfect  .practise is donbe mainly by understanding the ideas and the concepts .by learning facts we will just know about the fact .but by clearly undersatnding the main idea and the concept of that fact we will remember it for a longer time so that whenever we will come upon the fact we can clearly answer that question .but by listening the fact we may foreget the fact .students are the people who will make the world .todays students are tomorrows future  .in simple language we can clearly explain it by theory and practical .by theory we just get the information about a fact or about some information .but by doing the practical we get a clear view of that information .by doing reseach on that fact or by getting information on that fact by different sources we can clearly grab the information into our mind .by clearly undersatnding the idea about the concept we get the full knowledge about that fact and we can easily explain that information top othe people also .by practising or by doing any research on that fact gives us a lot of information on that fact .by doing that research we not only gain information not only on that fact but we will gain knowledge about some of the interesting things related to that fact .understanding the idea will remain in the mind .it s not that learning will not be in the mind but understanding the idea gives both practical and theoratical knowledge .thus understanding the ideas and concepts is more important for the students rather than learning .
