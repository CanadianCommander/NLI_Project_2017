it is hard to imagine the facts with concepts .they are both interrelated .i agree that students should concentrate more on understanding the ideas and concepts because it is difficult to understand the facts without knowing the concepts behind it .it is easy to clear the concepts and understand the ideas while studying because we have the help at hand and our teachers and mentors are there to correct us .for example if i see a patient with a swelling and without any history and clinical examination i can not tell what swellingit is and how i am going to manage it .to reach the diagnosis i need to clear my concepts to take a proper history and to examine this swelling .then i need to know the common sweelings found in the specific area and the pathology .i should know how to investigate this swelling and than i will be able to reach the correct diagnosis and would be able to treat this efficiently .as i am in the learning phase and during my training i have been able to learn these basic concepts with the help of my trainers and mentors .therefore before jumping to know the facts we should know the basic concepts first as i go through the basic things befor reaching the diagnosis .another example when a child grows up he speaks only few words initially and does not start speaking the complete sentences fluently because he tries to learn the basic things before he can speak and perform like adults .in conclusion i would like to say that learning the ideas and basic concepts first is very important and if we do not follow this principle then we will only know the facts not the concepts behind them .if it happens our knowledge and study will have no meaning because the main purpose of the education uisto make us aware of the concepts .
