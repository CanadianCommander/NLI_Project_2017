unlike past , we are living in an era where tons of informations are going around every single moment though books , the internet and other means of communications .the world is more complicated and complexed .to survive from these kind of environments , i believe , it is very important to have various knowledge of many academic subjects .first of all , having borad knowledge is very helpful to make social connections .if you are at a party , you meet various people .to be successful in social life , it is important to make conversations and meet people at social gathering .people now days have all various interests .to communicate with others and continue conversations , you need to know what others are interested in not just know details of mathmatics for instance .that s how people make friends and become social these days .also having various knowledge will help you getting a better job .these days , companies are requring new face who have comprehensive ideas .recently i had job interview .the question i got was solving problem of seoul s environment with historical knowledge and stastics which are totally two differnt academic fields .as i were similar to both of the subject not detaily but enough to answer the questions , i was hired at the position .and i am not the only example at nowdays job market .in addition , things are more complicated these days .so as the problems we are facing everyday life .to solve those problems , most times details of one special academic subject does nt give us solutions .therefore i storongly believe , acheiving comprehensive knowledge of many different academic subjects are much better than specializing in one specific subject as for those living in modern life .
