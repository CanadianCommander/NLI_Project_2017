ever since the advent of cars they have become an integral part of human life .the production of cars has seen a considerable rise over the years and this trend shows no signs of slowing down .i personally disagree with the statement that twenty years down the line we will see fewer cars on the road than we do today .a host of factors are responsible for me holding this opinion .these include improved production practices , fierce market competition , increased buying power of the consumers and a desire to push knowledge beyond the existing boundaries .the production practices involved in car manufacturing has come a long way .in the early years of car production the process was entirely manual .orders for cars had to be made years in advance .as silly as it may sound it is all true .but today car maufacturing is an automated process .it takes onl a few hours to assemble together all parts in the car .another interesting feature of the production system is that cars today are mass produced , not made induvidually .this reduces maufacturing time .once a customer places an order it is just a matter of a few days before he sees the car on his doorstep .this enhanced mass production sstem ensures that cars are delivered as fast as possible , and this is like an added incentive to the buyers .so the production system has contributed significantly to increasing the number of cars on the road .and with better manufacturing practices being implemented it only points to a greater number of vehicles on the road in the near future .the market for automobiles is a very competetive one .there are man plaers in the market ; this is a reference to te automobil compaies producing cars .it is not like the old days where there were only one or two compaies coming out with cars .there are a host of compaies producing cars in various segments .there are price wars on between cars in a particular segment .as soon as a company comes out with a price for a particular model his rival would come out with a slashed price of an equivalent model .all these market wars lead to slashed prices which is music to the consumers ears .these reduced prices so to speak contribute greatly to the increae in the number of cars sold .times have been changing and the automobile market is not restricted only to a privileged few any more .the purchasing power of the consumers has gone up manifold .more people can afford to buy cars now and today owing a car has socila reavace as wl .ars are produced b mafaturers in ma segments to cater to te needs of the people that fall under the particular segment .with this increasd purchasing power of the consumers the car sales have gone up and will continue to do so in the near future .finally enginners are alwas pushing the limits in search of newer pastures .the motivation amongst the engineering community will always results in the production of newer vehicles , beter production techniques etc .all these will certain cotribute to an increase i sales of the cars .considering all these factors mentioned above i feel that twenty years hence we will be looking at a world with more cars , though thats not essentially how we want it to be ...happy driving !!!!
