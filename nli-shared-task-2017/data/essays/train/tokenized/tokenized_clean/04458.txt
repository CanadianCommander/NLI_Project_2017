there are certains considerations or factors which everyone takes into account the issue .different people have different opinion due to their respective experience .on the one hand , some people assert that young people nowadays should volunteer help their communities .on the other hand , others believe that young people do nt have to help their communities because they do nt have enough time so far .in my opinion , i agree the fact that young people nowadays so not give enough time to helping their communities .in the following discussions , i would like to present the reasons to support my viewpoints .first of all , most young people are too busy concerning fashionable information such as stars information , friendships , and so on .it usually makes them do nt have enough time to help their communities .in other words , they usually concern about themselves more than others .for example , if you talk about that what happened to the famous star recently , they will have stronger interests in that issue such as wearing fashionable clothes , and attractive in their appearances .there are so many accractive things to worth them to pay attention to .second , most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do nt understand how their communities work .they have few contact with their communities .as a result , they do nt know get a whole understandings with their communites .at the same time , most young people are becoming more and more strange with their communities gradually , even unfriendly .fianlly , most young people prefer to spend more time making their own life and concerning their relationships .that is to say , in the repid development of society , there are full of pressures in our life , most of them focus on the incoming befenits which they earned as soon as possible .they do nt want to give more .most young people want to be lead a luxirous life and pursue for the dreams what they really want to in the future .they become more selfish .to sum up , given the reasons above discussion , i agree that most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .because they are educated more selfish , most of them concerned themselves more than others .in addition , they prefer to the other noticeable things to make their life more exciting and interesting .meanwhile , they do nt have enough opportunities to get in touch with their communities .they lack the connections and interactions between families , schools and communities .and that s the reasons .
