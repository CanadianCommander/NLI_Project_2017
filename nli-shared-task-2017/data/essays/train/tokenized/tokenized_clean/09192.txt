it is a matter of fact that doing only what you already know how to do it s a safe ground to moove on .most people prefer to live a quiet life , without risks , and troubles , while trying new things implies a certain degree of uncertainty .at the same time it is true that the contemporary world is extremely competitive and being a successfull person is everything but easy .to be successfull you need someone who notices you , and gives you the opportunity to show what you can do .specially at the very beginning , it is hard to be noticed among all the others .trying new things is a good way to avoid easy comparisons .how can someone judge you on something which is completely new ?on the basis of which criteria you can be considered either better or worse han someone else ?sometimes competing on a complitely new groud has a lot of adavnatges .i am deeply convinced that being successfull everyday means basically being able to be different , without fear of being far away from the avarage .a successfull person needs to be brave , in order to dare more than the rest of his competitors .you need to have a great self confidence in order to take the risk to fail .i think someone reaches the real success when he has no more fear to make mistakes .everyone learns from mistakes , it is a kind of natural rule .most mistakes provide you with the right answer to another question , and this is the way life goes on .in addition , i think doing only things that you already know how to do is an acceptable way of living for oldish people .sometimes , when you get old , you are scared by all the new challenges of the world around you .old peole most times are weak .illness can affect the general mental condition of people , pushing them to be scared by everything around them .the problem is that the same attitude is generally widespread among young people as well .it is probably coming from modern culture , and the contemporary view of waht life is .the main issue shoul be what life could be , instead .i do nt understand why most young people living in big towns always seem to be so bored of living .thet do nt even try to be successfull people .they simply accept to live an ordinary life , avoiding the risk to fail .
