i agree with the opinion that having the knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have deeper knowledge in one major subject .it is more important for the undergraduate students to have the basic knowledge in the fields like biology , history , chemistry , archeology etc .the students should be able to know the basics of the various subjects before taking the major subject .for example , if the student dont have the basic knowledge in the biology subject then he may not know the various organs of his body and their functions .then the student may not know the kind of food he must take for the proper function of the particular organ .he need to face so many problems if he doesnt know about the functioning of his own body .one more example is that , student can be able to know about the origin of the his culture and tradition if he has a basic knowledge of the subject ` history  .he can know about the different places in the world and he know better about the world map .the students should also be perfect in the general knowledge .he should know what is happening around him and also should know the changes in the political affairs .then only he could judge the things in a better way .he must know the current affairs .the university is the major source from which the students gain the basic knowledge in the different fields .they should provide a good environment for the students so that they can have the overall development .for the student the overall development is very much important to compete with outside world in the future .before choosing their major field the students must have a basic knowledge in the other subjects also then only they can compete with the outside world .
