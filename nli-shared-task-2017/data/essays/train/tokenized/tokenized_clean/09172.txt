i don-t totally agree with the statement .my opinion is definitely different from that .if we go to take a look at the past years we can only see a costant increase in the use of cars and i think it will constantly keep on growing up .there are a lot of reasons supporting my opinion .the first is the constant research for alternative energy also to be used in the cars .in fact a wider and wider area of the planet is under the threaten of pollution caused mostly by gas emissions in the air .even if this bad aspect exixts from a lot of years nobody has still found a solution and the result is an always much more polluted world .another reason why we-ll never stop to use cars is because we are totally dipendent on them .we can-t live without them .for example if i have to go out for an holiday , not abroad , but in my country , i would take my car and not other transport means like train .why ?because i should stay at its hour schedule and it-s not so seldom that it comes on late .in my personal opinion a modest advice i can give is to improve the transportation system in the country .as a student that has to take the train and the bus more than 5 times a week i noticed a big mess in every means .they are not only often on late but there are also strikes that cause a lot of problems to peole who have to go to work and should arrive on time .if we don-t try to solve these problems before , we-ll never stop to use our cars .i think we should take a look at some other countries where these aspects function better than here .for example i went to helsinki two years ago and i never waited more than two minutes for a bus , a taxi or for a train .every means was on time and in fact there were much fewer cars in streets !here in italy it-s quite impossible go around our city and don-t get trapped in the traffic !it-s terrible and sometimes a lot of people don-t have enough patience to wait and they start to scream or do very dangerours things .but every year nothing is done to improve the situation .how long still do we wait ???
