alwasy sucucessful pepole do new things that other pepole do not wwant to try .charanging new things has a risks .many pepole do not want to have risks .however , doing same things do not bring new oportunitys to get a sucesess .i strongly agree this statement .when i worked in japan as a nurse , there are a lot of nurses in a hospital .half of them have worked in the same hospital for a long time .half of them are nurses who have changed many times to work place .nurese who work same place for a ling time tend to have consabative ideas .they do not change new way of care style .of course , keeping traditional styles is important , but sometimes it is old fashion .nowadays , medical skills are improving and also needs of patients are chanigng ; therefore nurses need change the way of care style or the way of thinking .nurses who work in different hospital have a lot of experences for patients and the wat of careing for patients .their ideas are very useful and adovantage .many nurese think changing work place make them nurvas and hard to adjust new circumstances .however , it is good poprtunity to get now knowledges to have new experiences .in japan .many pepole tend to work same place and do not want to change their job because its style is very traditional .japanese pepole think changing or starting new things is not good and keeping same things is good things .however , many pepole are not surtisfid their job and they always complain about their job .consequently , a person who be sucsessful always charenge new things even tyhough they do not succeed soon .doing new things give us a lot of oportunities and new experiences .
