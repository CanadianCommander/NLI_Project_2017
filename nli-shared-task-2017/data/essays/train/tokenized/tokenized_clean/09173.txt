travelling is the greatest opportunity one can have .it opens up new horizons , exposes you to different cultures and opens you to a realm of exciting possibilities , all necessary to make you more open minded and a better human being .some say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i strongly disagree with this way of travelling .though it has the advantage of making the planning of the trip easier , as well as showing you the major attractions of an area in a short period of time , its negative points are too great to be ignored .travelling in a group means that you have to follow a planned schedule .now we all know that different people have various interests , and this limits you in experiencing and seeing what you are really interested in .also , travelling is not suppose to be routine , you should be able to decide where you want to go and when , and be able to change your intinerary according to how you are feeling that day , or depending on the weather , etc .it is true that you do get to see the main attractions of an area when travelling in a group , but you do nt get to experience the culture of the country your are visiting .being surrounded by a group of people who roughly share your culture and social status does nt leave a lot of room to meet locals , be immersed in a different language , explore spots that are nt major tourist attractions , discover the cuisine of the country or it s every day traditions .having traveled a lot , i believe that the best way to travel is without an itinary or a plan , being flexible and deciding your schedule according to who you meet along the way , your discussions with locals , your interests and your feelings .is nt that what travelling is all about , discovering a new area and culture and learning more about yourself along the way ?
