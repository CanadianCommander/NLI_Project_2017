what is advantage of decreasing the number of cars ?is it reducing the air pollution ?is it a sollution of the green house effect ?there are some people who agree with reducing the number of cars and they believed that the time will really come sometime in twenty years .however , i do nt agree that the time when the number of cars will be lower than now , and i think that it will be higher in the future .the car industry is too big to reduce the number of cars in the corrent world .some contries rely on their domestic industry for their economy .there are many employees who work for the car industry .if an idea of reducing the number of cars cames up , so many demos and strikes would are held all over the world .human being is very selfish creature .how many people prefer to loose their convenience `` foot  that takes them wherever they want to go without getting tired .some people work hard for buying their own nice car , other have many cars for changing a car for tpo like clothes .there are so many car manias and they would never allowed the movement of reducing the number of cars .these days , tabacco companies try not to show the advertisement too much because there are some movements to reduce the number of smokers .smoking is recongnized as bad for human health .however , if the movement of reducing the number of cars came up sometime in the future , it would be difficult to succeed because the advantage seems like only for the environment of the earth , but not for individuals .it will save the life of people at the end .however , i think that making the mind of people to move is really difficult unless the advantage directly looks to associate with the benefit of people lives .
