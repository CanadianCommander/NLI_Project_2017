i dont personally believe that after twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .there can be many claims supporting it .the world is progressing fast and making advancement in each and every field .the major advancements are in the field of science and technology .there has been continuous attempts to improve and develop newer and more cars .time is very precious for every individual .suppose you have to attend a very important meeting and ypu plan to take a bus or a metro , if you are lucky you get the conveyance the moment you reach , but wat if you just missed the bus .then , to your utter dissappointment you will have to wait for the next bus , which obviously means that you ll reach late at the meeting or will have to miss the meeting , if it happens that that day there all the buses n other conveyance are stopped .either of it will put a bad impression on the other staff .cars , though not the fastest but are most efficient and easy mode of travel if a person has to travel a short distance .now about the long journey like the cross country journey , obviously its not very feasible to use a car for it .as it will amount to a large petrol consumption and will often be more expensive .but some people who are nature lover , and enjoy watching nature and greenary prefer using car .for long distance travel , the flight being cancelled and late can cause a delay and also various other inconvenience to the passengers .to cater to these needs of a person and most importantly to save time , the demands of the cars are increasing , and thus its number is increasing .though we have many efficient and comfortable conveyance like aeroplane , metro train , but at times they may take up more time than cars .and as the world s becoming fast day-by-day , our need to save time and thus our need of car is increasing day by day .the technological development being made also favors and increase to increase profi
