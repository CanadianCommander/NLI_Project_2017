i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .being in a group and visiting a new city that i do nt know much about with a tour guide will assure me that i will not leave this city that i am visiting for the first time without missing out on any of the important features .for example , all the historical areas in the place , landmarks , important musiums , and famous art galleries or even nice restaurants .the tour guide will also be very informative and educating .they will be able to tell us about the history of each piece of art work that is found in a the famous art galleries and answer any question that might rise in my head or that i am curious about wich will make the trip more beneficial .additionally , being led by a tour guide will help me in managing my time since all tour guides willl have a set or a planned schedule from the begining of the trip and until the last day in order for the visitors to get the most of their trip .along with that , the feeling of being part of a group will eliminate lazyness from some individuals as they will feel obligated to attend the tour everyday .another benefit to having a tour guide is minimizing the chance of getting lost espicially if it s a new city that i am not familiar with .i have heard about many stories of people getting lost in new cities that they are visiting for the first time while trying to get back to their hotels .lastly , being with a tour guide will help me save financially since i will have a designated bus with a driver that will aid me in traveling for one site to another without having to worry about the cost of renting taxies for every trip .
