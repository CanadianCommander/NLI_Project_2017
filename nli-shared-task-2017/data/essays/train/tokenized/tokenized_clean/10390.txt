there are many examples in history which prove that risktakers who tried out new things often were exceptionally successful .on the other hand many stories prove the opposite and too much risk caused great dispair .within the following text two men shall underline these examples : henry ford and napoleon .with a short summary of what made out their live a conclusion with my own opinion finishes the essay .henry ford had a vision and ideas to let this vision come true .he wanted to achieve such a cheap car , that it becomes affordable to everyone .he knew how to minimize costs of production and calculated very well before starting the business .one can say that he had a dream but was not a dreamer and estimated the amount of risk very well .also in the aftermath , the success did not ruin his sense of reality .ford continued being realistic and careful .an opposite example is napoleon .he especially loved to be rich and successful and therefore accepted almost each risk .he invaded countries and was the biggest warrier of his time .but as he became too mighty , he lost his natural given angst .he became unconcius of obvious dangers .within his wish of never ending glory he lost everything and had to life in exile .consequently , i agree with part of the statement above .successfull people defenitely achieve innovations or do unknown things .but to be successcful for a long time , it is neccessary to never lose control about a business and never forget about realistic risks .and conditions .often , those who reach high aims become blind for their environment and are only driven by the willingness of achieving even more .i think it is absolutely important to carefully estimate the own talents and gifts and to be true to oneself .
