i totally agree with the statement for it is the very purpose of advertisements to raise the sales of the particular product .in a capitalistic society , it is a general rule that nobody would pay for anything he does not expect to get a benefit out of .companies place advertisements , `` commercials  for their products with the only purpose of selling them .this will generate profit , their benefit .competition drives them to discover the most efficient ways to do so .the most simple and basic form of advertising a product would be a neutral statement of its features .this is seldomly done , for there are provenly better ways to motivate potential customers to buy .even if it were true that all products that are advertised would have - from a neutral standpoint - features that would make them worth buying , this is not what the consumer asks for .it has been discovered that emotions are the key to human motivation .this very broad realization is being directly utilized by advertisements .i will illustrate with the automobile as an example .it is no secret that cars are very important for peoples  prestige : `` tell me what you drive and i tell you who you are  .therefore , a wide variety of different cars for different types of `` lifestyles  exists .commercials try to appeal to people that lead a certain lifestyle and to convey emotions that relate to it .in an ideal scenario , a customers  decision is entirely based on that he thinks owning the car will invoke the certain emotion that was displayed in the advertisement which again relates to his lifestyle .factors such as quality and price are totally neglected .as a natural result , in most cases , the car was made to look much better than it actually was .that is , when you judge from a natural standpoint , neglecting the `` emotional  quality of owning such a car .with the `` emotional  method proven to work as an effective means to raise product sales , it is consequentially applied by most companies for a wide variety of products .without trying to say that all products seem better in the advertisements than they actually are , it can well be generalized onto the vast majority of them .
