is our young generation egoistic ?the question is always the same , i think .before i will wrote my answer to this statement , i will ask : had parents the same meaning about the young generation in the 1950s ?i think yes .it is not the time , which make such things .it is the generation , which make , or here which not make , things in their communities .it was so and it will be in future .the young generation is not egoistic , it is their lifestyle .if somebody is young , he or she have to meet new people and make new experiences .they do nt want to stay at home or in their village .they have to go in the world to see new things .it is important and so they ca nt help their communities , their first and right choice is to help themselves .the right choice i think .but when the young people come back , in their village or in their family , they want to help .in my environment , there is a friendly partnership between the old and young people in my small village .almost all people in my village go to the church on sunday .it is a nice day for everybody and i do nt want to miss it .latest surveys show the increase of family values in the last ten years .for most people the family is holy .they defeat them against all .in a communitiy there is the same situation .either they fight against people who want to hurt somebody in the communitiy or they will stand together if somebody is ill .i do nt know how is the situation in south asia , for example , but in my environment the world in complete .here is this statement completly wrong and everybody around me would agree .the sports club , the church club and every other single club in my village have enough people to help .the statement is in my eyes only a typical prejudice of old people .
