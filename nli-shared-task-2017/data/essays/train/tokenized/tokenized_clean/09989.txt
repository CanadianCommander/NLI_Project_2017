there are many ways or system for education .some system prefer to educate as teaching idea and concepts , and some systems are teaching the facts .i strongly agree and support the idea that learning facts is always the most important thing in an education .lecturers and teachers mus encourage their students to face the facts instead of living in a dream world .in our days there are many researchs about physicoligacal condition of young people .big percentage of the young people involved in these researches are unhappy and complaining for their lives .the reason for this is , they are not at the position they demanded to be .because they were living in a dream world when they were teenagers .nobody told them the trues and the facts of the life .on the other hand if you tell a student always about any ancient greek hero or scholar lived in a historical time and always support the ideas that the hero stated , the student will begin to thing with the character you presented .but the student can not seperate and understand the conflicts between the ideas of this character and the facts of our decade , due to his  her young age .the other problem is our life is different than before .when you make a mistake , the result has worse impact than before .that result may lead a terrible effect to the student future life .the best idea to avoid these bad results , teachers must perform the meeting of the students with the facts as soon as they can .the worst thing is any bad experience that is impossiple to correct .
