i think that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts but i think that it is also important that studenst learn facts because this two learning strategies have advantages and disadvantages .one advantage if students understand ideas and concepts is that they do not need so much time to learn for an exam because if you have understand the facts the teacher has said in the lecture you can remerber easier to the facts .in addition to that you do not forget things so early because you know a lot of backgrounds so you will be a very clever person in the future and because of this you will have more success in your job because you are a well informed person .but the drawback lies in the fact that you have to afford more time to undersand ideas and concepts so if you have an exam and you do not have begin learning early it is not good for you to follow this learning strategy because you need to much time to prepare for your exam .on the contrary there are some advantages if you only learn facts .the first advantage i want to point out is that if you have to learn a big amount of something you are not able to understand all ideas and concepts because it is to much to remember for you for example in an exam .furthermore if you only learn facts you have more freetime for instace to meet friends , go to the cinema or relax in the sun because if you only learn facts the amount of learning material will be reduced and so you will be able to finish learning ealier .but there are also some disadvantages about learning facts .one disadvantage i want to mention is that if you only learn facts you will not have a good grand in your exam because you can not answer the questions which are asked in the exam very good because you don not know some backgrounds about the theme you have learned .if i compare the both learning strategies i think the advantages from the strategy to understand ideas and concepts predominate because in my opinion it is more imortant for a person to be very good informed and have some backgrounds .so you can see that it is a very clerver person and have succees in his or her job .
