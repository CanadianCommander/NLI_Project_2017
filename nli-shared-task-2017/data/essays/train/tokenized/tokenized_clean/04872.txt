in general , people prefer to do or participate in something that they already masterise , but taking the opportunnity to start something new can be more relevant .that s what i am going to discuss in the first part .currently studying at a university in paris specialized in information technologies and electronics , i agree that it can be very enriching to take the opportunnity in starting something you never did .i got this policy for a long time since i entered in this university .i always try to be aware of the news technologies related in computer science and , then to start using it .for instance , i am working on big project for one month now .this project can be summarize by creating a software used by agricultor in order to help them to organise their productivity .thought i use the java langage of programmation , i take the initiative to learn by myself a new language called ajax .i never learned it before but i think that it could increase the numbers of the fonctions for the software .thus , i rather take a risk in learning this language because i do nt have a lot of time to learn and use it correctly .moreover , as a student in fourth years , i do nt have a lot of time for other extra scholar activities .even if i know that working for a company at the same time of studying will be difficult i do it .for instance , the next month , i will develop the new website for a company and develop another one for an organisation .i accepted to work on these project in order to make of course some money to pay my scholarship but also to learn new things .everytime i take the opportunity to enter in a new project and participating very well i always learn more .no only on the technical field as programming but also on the human interactivity as communicaton for example .in conclusion , i approve tis statement and use to encourage my friends in doing itm even i know that i might probably help them .
