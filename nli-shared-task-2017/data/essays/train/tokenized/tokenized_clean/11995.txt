this summer i was in usa and faced with the fact that how cars became an important part of our lives .the transportation system was much more different than we used to have in turkey which caused me to get in trouble many times .then i started to think about the importance of cars and how they will be one of our obligatory needs like water or food in the next future .i believe that in twenty years time there will be more cars in use than are today .there are mainly two important reasons that i can see to support that idea .the first reason is the increasing world population .when we think 20 years before today , we will notice that the traffic problem was not as serious as today .by the increasing population the number of cars are increasing as well .people start to settle the areas that are not occupied before .this means new living areas appear that travelling long distances become obligatory .as i had mentioned previously , my usa experience had really showed me that obligation after seeing people travelling more than one hour to go to their works and schools every day .the second reason of why i believe there will be more cars in use is the technology and the things that it brings to our lives .with the new improvements in our technology we realize that our lives become much more easier .it is a fact that people follow the technology as they want to use their times much more efficiently .i believe nobody would like to spend half an hour or more by waiting in bus stops or standing in the crowded busses .another fact is that cars become cheaper and available as the technology develops the novel ones wich are more expensive .it seems that it is not very far to observe that cars will be an obligatory part of our lives that all the family members have their own cars by considering the increasing world population and the developing technology .
