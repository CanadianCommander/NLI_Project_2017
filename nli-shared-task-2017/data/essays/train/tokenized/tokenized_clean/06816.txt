i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .in my opinion , this is because of the change and developement of our sosiety .in the past , a lot of people had done agricultural industries , which need a lot of help and group works .farmers need to help each other to gather the crops and raise thgem .however , as our industires develop , a lot of people started to have service industries or manufacture .which requires less helps , and more competition among the individuals .because of these , a lot of young people seems to forget about the importance of helping their comminities and care only about themselves .these industrial change also changed young people s opinions .long times ago , many people thought that it s their duty to help each others .however , many young people now a day thinks it is waste of time and money to give even little helps to their community with out reward .for example , long times ago , if we had poor neighbore who is having a hard time , a lot of people tried to help them with out expecting the reward .however , lots of poors in our community suffer because no one voluntear to help them .because of the change of the opinion , a lot of young people are neglecting to do even small acts to help ous community .urbanization had a lot of things in our community , including the opinion of the people .as our society started to require more and more competition to survive , a lots of people thinks that the most important thing for them is to care about themselves and success .because there s to many people who do not even practice simple acts to help our society , i sometime feels like no one is caring about our community .
