the issue at hand is whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .this issue is important because it discusses the mentality of successful people and what they did to earn their success .i agree that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already know because that is the basic theme of sucess .according to me succes many a times means to be just different-a class apart .many scientists would have not succeded if they would have not thought differently than others .many businessmen would have not succeded had they adopted the same production and marketing policies .because of the above mentioned point i think successful people do new things .secondly doing new things also helps different other people who were not helped before , making the initiator succesful .for example , mahatma gandhi tried a new thing called satyagraha and and non-voilence and helped indians to come out of the clucthes of the british regime .he became successful because he tried a new practice in the history of indian independeence instead of watching in silence , a thing which an ordinary person would have done .hence at times helping people in a new way also makes a person successful .lastly a person who takes risks and tries new things gets an immense sense of fulfilment .in this way he becomes successful in his own eyes .doing things which already one knows makes him bored and the job monotonous .sometimes one tends to lose interests in everyday routine work , so trying new things or new methods would often make even a lay man successful in his own small way .in conclusion i would again assert that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .this is because only doing new and better things help them become succesful and different from others .
