i disagree with this statement .i strongly believe that in 20 years there will be more cars in use .first .why do people buy cars ?because they want to get an easy access to everywhere .they can go to wherever they want .though the mordern transportation has provided a fairly convenient ways for people to travel less time .can a plain directly take you to a beautiful rural village ?no !however if you own a car with gprs .you can go to every corner on the world .second .what kind of people buy private cars in our country ?the answer is wealthy people .now the number of the rich mushrooms , and these riches eagerly want to buy a car when they were in a poor status .becuase they thinks a car especially a high-ranked car can show their status .in the common estate where i am living .when i was very young , i could see few cars paking in the estate .as i grow up , i can see more and more cars begin to park below my building .now the parking area has been fulled with cars .what does that means ?that means the living standards in my estate can show the whole cities living stantard is growing .with rapid economic growth in our country , i hold that in our country there will be more and more cars , and so does it in the world .third .though a lot of people are complaining about the fact that car s emission will cause the green house effect and traffic jams during the rush hours during the day , i believe these problem will be solved in the near future , because the car manufacterers are inventing new-concept cars which cover less areas and without any carbon dioxide emission .these cars will definetely attacts more people to buy .fourth .pocessing a private car can have more privacies which a lot of people concern about .in the public transportation , your behavior is limited .to all of these factors , cars have a lot pf advantages , people in the future will more likely to choose their own car rather than taking the public transportation .so i believe that there will be more cars in use than there are today .of course , i will buy a car for my self in the near future .
