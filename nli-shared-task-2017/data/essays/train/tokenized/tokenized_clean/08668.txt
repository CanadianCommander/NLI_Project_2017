i strongly agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the society rapidly changes , facts will be someday outdated and not important when other facts show up .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is the best method to help student think abstractly and creatively .for example , in the car show , people would like to preform their ideal concept cars to give new insights to companies and customers the trend of the society flow .no matter the reliability and feature of the car , people have to think critically how the next step will be .if people just follow the stopped fact , people would not have new ideas to create and the society will not easily grow .fact is just let people know that people need to be aware without making the same mistakes and errors .in childhood , students have to learn art , math , music , and science subjects to help students increase insights and be abstract .understanding ideas and concepts can be used permanently , but facts is not .in some conditions , facts is more important when students make mistakes .teacher gives either reinforcement and punishment to stop students  behavior and help them create thoughts .in the fast-paced society , people everyday is struggling the meaning of life .for instances , money , realionship , culture , and safety are all meanful in human beings .this is a fixed fact .however , anything that gives meaning to human beings before fact would be ideas and concepts .students will not know what love and money means until the day they learn and experience , and then one day become their own fact .as a result , in the twentieth century , to go a step further , people have to understand ideas and concepts and ignore the previous fact in oder to create new insights to contribute the modern society
