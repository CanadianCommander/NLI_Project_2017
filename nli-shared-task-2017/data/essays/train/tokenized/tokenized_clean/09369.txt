in this essay i will write about my opinion of a risky attitute of a person , if it is rather good or bad .in my opinion the way of being successful is parted into two parts .one part is that a person , who wants to be successful , has to risk something , or , try something new .without that , the person will always stay on one point and will not move on .the person will not get any further on the persons privacy , nor at work .the person shows that he really wants to achieve somthing by risking something that is really important for him .as an example someone , who has his job as journalist for a newspaper since 20 years and always wirtes about the weather .he has a new idea which could mean to lose his job and still presents it to his boss .he risks his own job , but he could also get further in his carrier .by being risky , the person get something special , because not everyone does something new , which no one tried before .on the other hand the boss for an example has to count on you .so if you try something new and you faile , you can lose your job or do not get the chance to move on in your carrier .to be successful means also teamwork .when a person tries to be special and does not work with the others , because he tries to be better than them , than his success will stop at the point , when he needs his colleagues .to conclude , a risky person has to know where he has to stop and when he has to work with his colleagues .when he follows those points ( which i mentioned before ) he has the ability to be successful .
