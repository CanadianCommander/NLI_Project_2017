i think that younger people do indeed enjoy life more than older people .in my opinion younger people are supposed to have more fun because they have less responsabilities and do not have to worry as much about problems that come with adulthood , such as money , jobs and family .i am 17 and i can remember just a few years back when i was 15 , how different my life was .i did nt have to work , my school works was much less of a burden and i did nt have to worry as much about my future .now , only a few years later i realized that my life has changed completly because i now work and at the same time i need to keep my gradees up so that i can get into college .i realize that from 15 to 17 is not really growing up , and that being a 17 year old is not considerd being an elder , but what im trying to say that with age comes more and more responsibilty .now that i m older i see how much time and effort my mom puts in to making my sister and i happy .my mom constantly looks for work , so that she can make money .she always has to make sure that my sister s and my every need is being taken care of .sometimes i feel like she might forget about herself .as my mother works hard like this day after day all i worry about is my school work , my job and what im going to do next friday .all i worry about is things for me , while my mom worries about my sister , myself , my animals , my home , her job , her self and many other things .she has got to make sure that everything is running smoothly .i cant imagine being her and having to do all those things .i sometimes wonder , does she ever have fun ?does she ever go out ?the reality is that she does but when she tells me stories about when she was younger she always syas `` ahhh . ..those were the good times .each time she says that i realize that being an adult can be hard work .because i m still young i still get to do many fun things , but as i get older peopel around me expect more and more from me and those expectations mean , to act mature and be responsible .surely , as i get older i have noticed that my priorities have changed .i look at my sister , who is a freshman in high school , and see how different we are .she worries very much about what she wares and what she looks like , while ide rather worry about getting to school or passing my physics test .i asked my mom if i was like that and she said `` we all go through it , we all mature . ..its part of adulthood .we all at some point of our lives stop having the same fun as we had as a child .look at babies all they do is sleep and eat , while parents wish they could get some sleep or even loose a couple of pounds .in the end i trully believe that younger people enjoy life much more than older people because they have less ressponsibilities and less things to worry about .although throughout your life you are longer an adult than you are a child , you will always remember `` those good old days  because they are a reminder of when you where care-free and had nothing to worry about .
