party and company is a game i play with my family and friends every time we want to share , have fun , and relax from the rutine of the week .the objective of the game is to accumulate the greatest amount of points in order to win the first place .participants have to apply their knowledge of many academic subjects while playing this game .once , i had the opportunity to play this game with one of my sister s best friend , alesia .alesia is studying international relations in a very well known university in the united states .she is very smart and demostrated , while playing party and company , that she has a broad knowledge of many academic and importat subjects .after experiencing how alesia won this game and left us amazed , i can say that i agree with this statement .because she demostrated the importance of having knowledge of many subjects .alesia chose a major in internatinal relations .by studying this major , she has the opportunity to learn about many subjects like politics , religion , economics , law , and cultures .specializing in one subject can be postive but it is better to know about many things that influence our society .in order to succeed and make a difference in our society , people should be prepare and should know how to deal with different topics .today s world is asking for persons who are very well prepared .for example , the world needs women who not only are the base of their families , but also who can debate and state their point of view with concrete bases in the profesional context .i would like to state that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , only if this knowledge is clear , concize and determined .because , it is not worth it to know about many topics if the ideas in which they are based , are vague .alesia is for me the best example of how this statement is true and i agree with it .because while playing this simple game , she demostrated to us how she knew about history , politics , nature , religion , culture , economics and supported his ideas with clear bases leading her group to win the first place .
