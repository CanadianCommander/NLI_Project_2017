do you agree or disagree that successful people try new things and thak risks rather than only doing what they already how to do well .as far as i am concerned , i agree that successful people only try new things and taks risks .in my opinion that successful people must have some kinds of the special capacibilitis that normal people do nt have .these are my opinions in the following reasons .first of all , i wander that what kind of people will have a lots of guts to become successful ?they must obtain a greatness dream to stimulate them keep moving on .for example , if they want to finish this hard work that boss ask for them to do , they must work on harder and harder , even no time to eat .this target is one they want to achieve and want to get the boss s praise , so they take the risk may become unhealth to conqure the goal .secondly , no pain , no gain .i indicate the people who are willing to take the risk must have the scene of confidance .for stance , there ca nt be complete the whole thing without confidance .however , the successful people show their confidance in when they are find the way to deal with the problems and figure out the tough issues .moreover , the hard-wroking people represence the most confidance when they have no ways to do , they can utilize their individual ability to overcome the problems .to sum up , i utter that the successful peopole that try new thing and take risks make them become success .in the end , i will conclude my opinions by emphasizing .people need to have the creatibility to think the new methods to deal with problems , espesially when they get stuck in the awful way .
