in my opinion one must rather specialize in a specific topic , rather then have broad knowledge on various fields .it is also a lot easier to gain knowledge on a variety of topics superficially .while this may give us a lot of information , it will not be helpful in getting answers .in the past , it was perhaps more beneficail to have a wider range of information .however , as we continue to advance in all walks of life , it is going to become increasingly difficult to obtain new information unless we dig deeper and deeper in the topics at hand .this will require a us to specialize in specific areas of study .we will have to tackle problems at even more minute levels .we can consider the exapmle of biotechnology .this field traditionally included the subjects of molecular and cell biology , and the basics of biochemistry and physiology .today however , biotechnology spans areas such as particle physics , high speed computing and even biomechanical engineering .it would be virtually impossible to have information about all these branches .moreover , the only way to excel at these topics would be to specialize in them .the need of the hour is collaboration between individuals in specialized fields .with a high level of specialized knowledge .on a more personal front , i feel than a persons self worth is perhaps elevated when he/she masters their field of interest .it seems rather easy to gain broad basic knowledge as it is so readily available .with tools such as the mass media and specially the internet , it will be even simpler to do so .however , specialized knowledge will push us to think in newer directions .collaborative efforts between specialists in different fields will help us decipher several vexing problems which currently have no answer .overall , it will give rise to newer and beneficial technologies .an only through specialized study can we be a part of this revolution .
