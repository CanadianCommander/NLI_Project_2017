in the past , scientists used to specialize in a specific subject and keep going deeper and deeper in this subject .nowadays many scientist try to learn more than one subject .for example , biologests try to learn more physics and chemistry .i totally agree with this .science has many branches and these branches may interact with each other very often .if a chemist wanted to make a new midicine he has to know something in biology .otherwise , he will not be able to make this midicine .the same thing goes with physics and biology .by studying more than one subject and trying to apply one subject in another one , scientists can make big devolopments in different field of science .new branches of science has been discovered by combining to or more branches of scinece together .biochemistry is an example of those new branches .biochemistry is giving a big contribution in the frield of midicine .moreover , making new midical devices and artificial organs need knowledge in biology and physics together .specializing in on subject only will , definitly , narrow the contribution of the scientist to the society .contributing as much as they can to the society is the scientists goal .thef can have better chances of reaching their goals if the combined the knowledge of different fields of science .i also think that a scientist can speacialize in one subject and he can also learn something from the other branches of science .if this scientist worked with another scientist who has another field of speciality , they together can make larger contributions to the scociety .working in groups and uniting the knowledge is very helpful in devoloping the different feilds of science .
