i agree with this statement for the following three reasons .first of all , i do think learning the basic ideas of the concepts or the lessons are more important than knowing the facts .take the math class for example .in most math classes , the students are taught the facts of the theories .and there are some basic ways for them to calculate the math questions .but it is not useful for students to understand the meaning for the question .they always try to momorize the way how to calculate them instead of truly understand the meaning of the questions or the reason they use the way to solve them .it makes students easy to forget the way how they calculate them as long as they do not try to keep them in mind often .it fails to teach students the real meanings of education .second , if all the students only try to know and remember the facts instead of understanding the concepts and ideas , it is such a pity for students to know the valuable treasure that our ancestors left for us .take history for example .we did have a lot of famous wars or events in history and they all have their special meanings at that time .why they were fighting ?what factors made them do this ?and what the results were made after these war or great events ?if the generations such as the students only know the facts that who wins and lost in this war instead of trying to understand the meaning of the history , they will not gain what the ancestors left for us and what they really want us to learn from these experiences .finally , if the students can learn the ideas and concepts instead of being told the results , they will learn how to think and judge things by themselves .we do not want our students to be the learning machines .it is so sad if students get used to receiving information instead of thinking them and responsing them .if that happens , there is no interaction between the teachers and students .we should discipline our students to think and judge things .they will have their own thoughts if they learn the ideas or concepts , they will have quetions and responses to them .that is the way that we should educate our students .in conclusion , as an old saying `` we should teach students how to fish instead of giving them fish directly .teachers and the educational system should put more emphasis on educating students the basic ideas and concepts .
