method of studying is always different from student to student .many people hold their perspective to undestand ideas and concept while other prefer to learn facts .i too beileve that it is more important for student to understand concept and ideas than to learn facts .the reason , i think this way is because understanding ideas and concept clearity increase the creativity of student and it gives better knowledge for further growth .concept clearity and clear ideas provide better foundation for future education of student .one reason , i believe that concept clearity and clear ideas give better foundation to a student is because if we understand ideas and concept then we never forget the subject .take my own example , when i was student i always preferred to concept clearity .i still remember the concept of newton s laws ; because my physics teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about this subject .therefore it is always better to clear the concept and ideas so that we will never forget the same .another reason , i believe that concept clearity and understanding ideas is important is that it increase the creativity of student .when we understand the concept of any theory then we feel more innovative to discover some more things .in fact every scientific discovery was started from fifferent ideas .for example , when adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then only he could concluded that electrons can be used to flow electricity .this is how understanding concept about atom lead to the discovery of electricty .all these are not to say that to learn facts are all use less .facts are related to generally past which is also important .but advantages of learning facts can not surpass the advantages of clearing concept and understanding ideas .in short , in this scientific world , student with capability of learning ideas and with clear concept has better future than those who learn fact only
