when i first came to sri lanka , in 1993 , there were hardly any cars .instead , buses , trains and tuk-tuks were ideal modes of transport at that time .there were lots of bikers in the streets as well where some would be selling icecreams or simply be on his way to work .after living five years , my father had taken few years off his work .together as a family , we emigrated to edinburgh for couple of years .i was around 15 , when i was back in sri lanka .everthing was different .yes , i could still see the tuk-tuks and the buses in the streets .however , bikers where some used to sell icecream or bread , had completely disappeared .instead , there were millions of cars .known for having wild driving style in sri lanka , moments spent on the road were nt very safe as it used to be .more traffic , more accidents .currently , the situation has gotten much worse .where it used to be just 15 minutes from school to home , it is now 45 .of course , it varies on different time of the day , but however the fact is that the number of cars have certainly increased .i can not see why that will not be the case 20 years from today .the situation will only be changed , if there were an alternative mode of transport which will offer the same advantages offered by a car .for example , convinience , availabilty and comfort .trains , nor buses can neither fully satisfy the demands of the people .unless there is a superior advancement in transport , i believe cars will hold dominance over all other modes .
