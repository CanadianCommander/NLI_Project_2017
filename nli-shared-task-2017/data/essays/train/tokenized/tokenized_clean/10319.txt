it is a common belief that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , and for this reason they help making them look more desiderable .in my opinion this belief is true , and this is why a lot of investments are made on advertising .the first fact that makes products more desiderable is the way they are presented .if the description underlines the positive aspects of the products , and if it hides negative aspects of them , it is likely to happen that people would appreciate them .for example a beer may be advertised describing its flavour and its colour in a very positive way .besides to make it desiderable it should be presented not mentioning problems of alchoolism and driving accidents .the second think that help advertisment to make its products better is the association of them with positive aspects of life .for example , when you advertise a kind of beer you can present it as the one drunk by very important people , or you can take a photo of a beautifull naked woman with your beer in her hands .the positivity of the persons linked with the product is automaticaly transfered to the product itself by the receiver of the message .another aspect related to this subject is the absence of the product .when you are looking at an advertising image or a tv program it is probable that you have not that product nearby .when you see it , presented in a positive light , associated with a positive event , you want it .the absence increases desire .the desire of the product makes it better simply because it is not present .for example if you see a beer on the television in a hot day , presented as a very fresh drink , by a beautifull young woman , you desire it .the desire makes the beer much better than it really is .
