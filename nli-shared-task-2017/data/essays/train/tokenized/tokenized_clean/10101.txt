although people specialized in one specific subject have often a better knowledge of it as i do , i prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic sujects for two main reasons .firstly , i believe that a good knowledge on several topics will help me to find more jobs in very different areas .indeed , i am doing engineering studies and i like both the automotive and the aeronautic industries .in order to start my first job in one of these industries and to have the possibility to switch to the other one after a few years , it is crucial for me to keep a broad knowledge in both two fields .secondly , a broad academic knowledge will help me to better understand the world around me .indeed , even if a strong knowledge would allow me to understand a specific subject more in details , i think that a broad knowledge will allow me to understand many more subjects with a sufficient comprehension of them .a good example can also be taken from my studies .i learned fluid mechanics in details and i only had a short introduction to other subjects such as turbomachinery or acousitc .nevertheless , my basics in acoustics were more than sufficient to understand the most common acoustic phenomenon that surronds me in my day-to-day life .i can now easily understand how a speaker or a microphone is working and explain the basic principles to my friends , even if i do not know all the theory in details .in conclusion , although some students prefer to specialize in one specific subject , i definitely prefer to acquire a broad knowledge on many academic subjects .it will help both in my professional life as well as in my life out of the office .
