accoding to the adage `` in the middle of risk s there will be a success  success ful people will try new things and take risks .when we call a person is successful ?if a person achieves his goals , tagets , destity by overcomming all the problems , risks , difficulties that he had face then we call that person as a successful person .trying new things is the common characteristic of a successful person .as an instance mahatma gandhi who is called father of the nation is a big successfull man .he is the person who achieved his goal of getting independence for country between lot of risks .one will be surprised by knowing him how he faught for the country .he had done many new things during the freedom fight for the country .another instance is mr.murthy who is the founder of company `` infosys  he is the successful person who achieved his goal of establishing the multinational company , which had changed the structure of the indian market , and had given chance to evolve the computer industry in india .with out doing any risks , or with out trying any new things he would not achieved this status .success is always with risks , if any one who wants to get success in life he should definitely do some kind of risk .in the modren world we are having many sophiticated technology which would not happen with out doing any risk .innovation is another key for the success .trying new things will give the person a chance to open in that field and create a new thing which can change the life .by trying new things one can experince a lot more in the life and also will become forerunner for others .we all achieved this modren world by trying new things for instance advent of internet had changed the world , i think no one would not expected this drastic change because of the internet .finally , in my opinion successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
