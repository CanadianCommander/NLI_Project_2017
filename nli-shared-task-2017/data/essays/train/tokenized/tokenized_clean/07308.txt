i disagree with the statement .i think there will be a increasing needs to own cars around the world majorly due to ( i ) worldwide population growth and ( ii ) industrialization of under or less developed countries .even though the rate of increase seems to modify , the global population is still in increase , thereby creating basic grounds for the need of new car .as you may easily imagine , the more people live in the earth , the more personal vehicles they will need , and certainly no other personal vehicles ever invented will outbeat the cars in the foreseeable future .the industrialization of under or less developed countries , such as those in africa or asia , will also create new need for the cars .looking back the history of 20th century , it is reasonable to think that there will be many under or less developed countries will grow to be more industrialized in 20 years .the industrialization will stimulate the construction of the infrastructure , such as the road and increase the level of income of each people .when two things combined , the massive need for the new cars will be created .taking for example , korea , my home country , there were not many cars in 1980 s .however , together with the rapid industrialization , a number of cars used in korea has increased dramatically .one may argue that as the people grows older , they tend not to drive a car and as the average life of people around the world gets longer and longer , it will cuts the number of cars used in the future .i agree , in part , to such argument , but in my view , when people gets older , they normally do not buy new cars when their cars get outdated , rather than immediately dispose of the cars that they owned .therefore , such an impact , even though it may be real , will not be huge .putting such factors into consideration , i trust that the cars which will be in use after 20 years will outnumber the be
