`` who wants to be a millionaire ?  is a tv show produced and broadcasted in many different countries .everybody who regularly watches this show will recognize that people winning high amounts of money in this show have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects .many people claim that it might be better to have such a broad knowledge of different fields than to be specialized in only one given field .nonetheless i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .the first point to support this opinion is the rapid growth of knowledge .man s knowledge doubles every three to five years .several hundred years ago it was possible to study theology , astrology , astronomy and medicine and then claim to be a man having the whole knowledge of the whole world , being extensively educated in any known field of science .with the huge amount of knowledge we have gathered today this is no more possible .thus there is a certain need to reside in one specific subject .a second point is that one has to adapt to a certain grade to what industry and society needs .industry is looking for highly trained specialists , engineers , physicians and phycisists .but not for someone who tells them he knows everything , but only to quite small extents .with this knowledge you might be an interesting candidate for `` who wants to be a millionaire ?  , but not for a good job in industry .third , i think it might be quite a boost for your self-confidence to be able to see yourself as a real expert on a given topic .last year there was a certain awareness concerning avian flu , and there was no single day without the news reporting about it .in most of those articles and shows there were citations of experts on the topic of virology , highly trained specialists who really knew how to fight flu .but there was no single citation of anyone claiming to be the one to know little about flu , but also about every other topic .to have a chance as an expert , you need to be a specialist in this subject , and this will only leave you little time to gather broad knowledge of other subjects .what we need today is the expert highly specialized in one specific subject .to address different issues it might be necessary to combine experts and build teams , but in a world facing such a rapid growth of knowledge specialization is according to my opinion definitely the best and only effective way to go .
