students in schools take their courses with either their choice or what they were preffered to take .high schoolers are required to take general classes and students in colleges narrows down their subject to their major subject .even though students will be deciding their major , they should have knowledge from several academic subjects .at first , students are supposed to take courses accourding to their interests .taking courses of what they are intersted in make them work harder and it will keep the students  motivation for studying .even though they are choosing from their interests , their knowledge still should not be based only on one specific subject .as the students study only from one subject , their knowledge will be narrowed down .even though it is possible , it is hard to live the world and live in this society as one worker with only knowledge from specified subject .getting knowledge from many academic subjects will build the basic knowledge for the students to go out to the society and work .without broad knowledge , people could often mislead their ways and decisions .even if the students learn from specific subject , they need to have broad knowledge .their knowledge from other subjects will help them to learn more for their major subject because there are always connections between each subjects or basic thought in the subjects .nowadays , it is hard to live in the society only with knowledge from one specific subject .the students will not know if their one specific subject is right for them or it really interests them .it can be hard to change their ways without having any broad knowledge afterwards .no one knows if their one specific specialized subject will support the students through whole life .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be life support even in their jobs .for example , becoming a business man will not be accomplished only with studying marketing .as they survive in the business world , they need accounting , various languages , and psychology .these three subject will support the business man fully .to have broad knowledge from many academic subjects , people will have less trouble and more fun to live their life through .people will need basic knowledge because everything is connected in the modern society .
