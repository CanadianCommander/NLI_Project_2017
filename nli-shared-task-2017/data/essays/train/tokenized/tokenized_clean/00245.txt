i agree with the statement saying that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .it is more interesting to understand concepts , because it will be a base you can use , modify or widen , whereas if you learn facts , you ca nt go further .let s take examples .to a student studying history it is very important to learn the facts , which is part of his knowledge .on the other sid , if he understands the logical connexions between various historical events : what led to them , which are the consequences and how they got resolved ?he will be more conscious of the subject , and thus will be able to explain it .in architecture for example , it is important to know some facts , that are milestones in the history of architecture , but what is more convincing , is not the application of facts , but the accurance of you concept when you will present your project .to me , there is a big difference between `` understanding  and `` learning  .if you learn something , you are only a `` recipient  that is able to contain and to restitute information .you will not be able to talk about the subject , once you have quit the sphere of your knowledge .whereas if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectual limit anymore which are consequences of ignorance .nevertheless you can widen your knowledge and go beyond the limits once you have understood the ideas and concepts .in my opinion , both of them are complementary .you ca nt have a solid base if you do nt know facts , but in the same time , if you undestand ideas and concept , it will help you to learn facts .but it i had to choose , i would rather understand concepts than being limited by what i have learned .
