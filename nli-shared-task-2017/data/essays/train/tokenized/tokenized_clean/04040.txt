i do not agree to the statement .in my opinion successful people do nt do new or different things .but they do things in a different maner than others which gives them success .there are a lot of areas that a person can explore in his life .he dreams to be someone in life that will take him to new heights and new horizons .however in this process he undergoes various adaptations , learns new principles .what matters success is the method in which it is attained .for birth of a new thing its not always trying something new will give success .it is the perseverence with which it is done .not all inventions are successful at the first time .for example thomas edison invented the bulb on his hundredth attempt of his experiment .so in this process no doubt he did invent the bulb which was a great invention in that time .but at the same time he never gave up on his plans and attempt by attempt he rediscovered his theory behind the electric bulb .there are many scientists , archelogist , poets wo were not given the recognition they deserved on their inventions .many times they were discouraged by the society to bring about changes .so society also molds life of a person .so in my opinion a person has to leave behind all the blocks that try to hinder his performance .positive attitude also plays a major role in anyones success .there are many negative elements in the society which always brings the marale of a person down .for success to happen a person has to be dedicated in his aim .he should act accordingly to attain his objectives .moreover trying new things does not alone bring success .the circumstances in which a person attains his plans of life also play a major role .there is always a difference between a man that is self made and a man who has readily got an establishment from his forefathers .the self made man with his motivation will try to evolve into something he always wanted to be .he has his goals set and in the least favoring conditions he will move ahead with his goals .however a man who has a readymade establishment will try to continue in the same status .he would not try to move ahead with the given foundation .hence only a man who knows the techniques behind say business management or technical principles will be successful .hence just trying out new things and taking risk need not always bring success .instead a man can be significantly sucessful if he tries to do things he already knows in a different maner .for example for a ball bearing manufacturer who has a fixed clientele can try to expand his business by setting up additional manufacturing plants and increase his clientele and the applications where the balll bearings are used .there is a saying in the business management world that `` not taking a risk is also a risk  .the timing should be adequate and the should be calculated earlier .hence according to me trying out new things should be on the mind of every individual but it should be accompanied by various qualities as described above to make it a big success .
