nowadays young people give not enough time to helping their communities .but there are several points to consider before judging them .firstly the expectations to the young people are high .school requires a lot of learning and working on homework .the same tasks are maintained at the university level .that means that `` work  not always ends in regular time patterns and its hard to reserve a certain time of the week for community work .also they might participate in several additional courses of the university , like sports , choir or art projects , which is also a time-intensive hobby .and therefore , are they not helping a community with these hobbies - they are helping the university community .furthermore it is important to register , that many young people do not life in one community and are asking themselves what is `` their  community .for examples students might spend a lot of time in university and at home .in the most cases this are two different communities .therefore they can not identify enough with either community and it is hard to convice somebody to sacrifice a lot of otherwise free time to something that he does not consider himself part of or responsible for .another aspect is that nowadays maturity and the developement into an adult takes more time .many young people still play a lot of computer games and have rather childish hobbies at an age , in which they would be expect to have a work an be more independent from their parents .and the sozial attitude to help others is rather found in adultsfinally there is the point about family .the family is also an community and it should be the most important one .the most young people marry at the age of twenty-six or even older .so can you expect somebody who is still busy settling his most important , personal community right accuse for spending too less time for others communities ?so in the end , on first sight many young people may not enough or even no community work .but if one considers the circumstances of our lifestyle and the expectations of the modern , many young people do enough for their communities despite all their other challenges .
