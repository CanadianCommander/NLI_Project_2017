in my opinion it is more important to understand the main ideas and principles of what you are supposed to learn than to learn some facts by heart .if you only learn some procedures or facts by heart , you wo nt be able to tailor your knowledge to a new task .and i think you will forget this knowledge very soon .for example i have learned very much for the final exam in history by heart , but after that exam i have forgotten all these facts very rapidly .but on the other hand i have tried to understand everything in maths and i still can rememder most of the knowledge i needed for the final exam .and the grade in maths was by far better than the grade in history .that is the main point why i think understanding the ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts by heart .nevertheless , there are some things you have to learn by heart , because without some key facts you can not understand some ideas .one example is that you can not calculate a maximum of a function , that is to illustrate profit figures , without having learned what the definition of profit is and without knowing how to find out where the maximum is .as one can see from the examples given in my text , learning facts by heart has a very limited usability for new problems but there are some occasions in which one can not avoid learning key facts by heart , because otherwise one can not understand certain concepts .nevertheless , i think it is clear that understanding the principles and ideas is superior to stupidly learning facts by heart .another important advantage of understanding the ideas behind a certain fact is that you can easily find a perfect solution for problems that are based on the same ideas in notably shorter time and that you do not have to learn every scenario by heart , because you can derive it from a `` basic  scenario .so you have to keep less in mind .
