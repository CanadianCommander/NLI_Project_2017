in this statement of choosing if will be fewer cars use than there are today , i think my answer is there will be fewer cars in some places in the world and some other places staying the same of even increase the car using .the following points are my reasons for my opinion .the first reason is different countries require different uses of cars .we know that in the world today , there are different levels of countries .what i mean is there are developed countries and developing countries or even poor countries .different countries require differents uses of cars like china .china is such a big country and it definitely require lots of cars as it got the biggest population in the world .some small countries like tailand or canada , they got maybe just one ten of the populations as china , therefore they might have less uses of cars all the time long .the second reason i think is because cars make too much polutions .there are millions or even billions of cars in the world .everyday we see cars driving on anywhere as a city living people .in some big cases like hongkong , beijing , newyork , these are major cities in the world and certainly as too much cars inside there will be more poluted gas coming out .people can easily get sick by those gas as it originally come by oil .also the plants out in the nature and all kinds of enviroment .as people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment , i think that some countries will reduce the uses of cars in the following years .besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car uses , these countries might keep their numbers of uses of cars .the last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology .today we can almost see computers anywhere in the world , we can see many differents kinds of inventions coming out .these new things are invented for helping human beings to live better .i surely to say that it will do same on the cars .in many developed countries like america and england , german .there are always new productions coming out , there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water !the resource is something we can get easily .anyway , my opinion is that as some powerful countries can do very good on inventing , they must reduce the old type of cars before .in a word , cars are still important in some of the places in the world and some of the places are getting rid of them .it depends on how you want to use cars and the most important thing related to it , which is the environment .
