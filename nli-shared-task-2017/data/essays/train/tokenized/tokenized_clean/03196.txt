overall , i agree with the statement .progress of individuals and of society as a whole has always been based on taking risks and exploring new options .not only would the known world not include america , had christopher columbus not taken the risk of sailing thousands of miles in a frail little boat , we would also still be traveling on foot instead of using cars , planes and submarines .while trodden paths can tak us through everyday situations , success requires us to see and , more importantly , use oppotunities .however , the key to success is not taking every possible risk , but to recognize and take those risks that one can benefit from most .a successful manager will not avoid risks , but rather weigh them against their potential benefit and then decide to his best knowledge .a successful general will not seek to avoid confrontations but choose a battlefield that gives him advantage over his enemy .on the other hand , someone driving at night at a high speed without headlights takes a considerable risk without apparent peronal benefit and might be called a stupid rather than a successful person .taken together , i think that an intelligent balance between risk and benefit distinguishes a successful person from the average or outright dumb .simply taking risks does not .
