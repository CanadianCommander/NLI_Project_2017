in korea , students who are before entering a university should memorize most of evrrything to prepare the test of university .why should hey do memorize everything ?i think understanding those and experiance are more important than just learnig .there are some reasons .first of all , if students just memorize idea and comcepts fot theit goals such as entering a university , getting a job , and graduation , will they remember it long time ?i think the answer is `` no  .because thier ultimate goals are not learnig and understanding for themselves .thus , they just have studied to enter a university and if they enter a university , they will forget it eaily because they got thier goal yet .second , if student do nt understand ideas and concepts , those will be furtile .it is because although they study those , they did nt try to understand ideas .if they did nt understand , will they use the knowleadge ?and then can we call that is `` knowleadge  ?the learnig that is not be understanded is just waste .i think rather that not to know those better than it .finally , in korea , there are a few exentric school now .those are same other school to learn .however , the style of study is different .it is that their lessons are focused by understanding study .so , sometimes they go out to learn in class time .they experiance and understand everything so accumulate those .as a result , the students of the school enter a university easier than ordinary school .this tell us that understand is more imprin conclusion , if students try to understand ideas and concepts , actually they should spend time long .however , the effort of them will appear clrealy and develop themselves more .
