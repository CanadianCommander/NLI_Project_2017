being young people imply to have more physical and psichological energy to enjoy of life , however the experience on life and the years acumulated could lead in give more energy to older people to enyoy their existencie .years give more knowledge to take more advantage of their life in different areas .an old person enjoy more of the simple things as the nature , people and experiences , due to they have different phylopsophy of life .the mature people during their life acumulate different kinds experiences and memories that probably link to relate every new event with their past .moreover , these have double satisfaction for them experimenting a new experience and joining with the past events .for example my grandmother , 76 years old , she always enjoyed more when we go to visit the national park in my country because she could remember the times before that she came , and at the same time her new experience with her grandchildren make her feel so happy when she has the opportunity to tell her stories related with that visit .simple thinks like that visit and bring their back memories enjoy more the old people that probably any joung people could enjoy .older people have incorporated inside the clock of life is running faster for them for that reason every moment is taking as a last .with this thinking probably they can see the world different than the young people who are always busy in their studies or jobs .old people have more time to enjoy because at this age they dont work .they can feel with more intensity the relief of stress of no being working .the experience of the years teach them to appreciate the nature of the world and enjoy of it , they take more attention at the beauty of the a flower instead of being worry the trivials problems as a young people is involved .
