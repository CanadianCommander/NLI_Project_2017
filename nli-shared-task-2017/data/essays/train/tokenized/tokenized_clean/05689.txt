young people nowadays tend to play more than to work for their communities in almost developing nations like south korea , because they live under their parents  roof .i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .firstly , they have to spend a lot of time studying , and secondly , are more irresponsible than before .first of all , in universities or colleges , the period of professional course require more time .for example , in order to be a doctor , you have to spend four years in univiersity , another four years in graduate school , and last two years for a degree .for men who have to go to army in certain country like in south korea , men take a lot of time to be a fully finished doctor .because the required time had increased , young people can not help their communities until they finish their education .furthermore , young people these days are more irresponsible than before .i do not have rights to say that young people are not responsible because i am still in middle school .however , i can still see many problems resulting among the young people .they tend to play more than work or study their professions , and that is the reason why there is so many un-employed college students .my cousin sister said to me , for example , that majority of students in universities play around on weekends , when they can use that time doing useful things , such as community service program .because they just tend to play around , they do not get to be helping with their communities .for these reasons , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .however , i do not mean that it is their entire fault , yet they have to fix their behavior to play instead of to study or to help their communities .because of the requirement of men going to army , men have to sacrifise their preciouse time of youth .i think that the south korean and other countries that requires to force men in to armies have to make the policy voluntary instead of involuntary .then , i think the young people will give enough time to help their communities .thus , i think it would involve a lot of changes to let the young people to give enough time to help their communities .
