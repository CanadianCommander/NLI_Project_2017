i truly convinced that the relation between `` ideas  and `` facts  is so strict that it does not make sense to discuss wheter it is more important for students to understand concepts or facts .i am engineer and during my own experience i can provide some example to explain better what i think about this issue .one of the most difficult course is optical communication , there are thousand equations to explain the trasmission of an optical signal from one point to another , i read the book and payed attention to all the lessons but althought all the mathematical implications were cleared to me , i was not able to apply them and in that semester i failed to pass the exam , i did not understand the reason for my failure after all i knew all the concepts .i decided to ask my problems to the professor who took me immidiatly to the communication lab , showing all the applications of what i supposed to know .thought that experience , learning `` facts  i deeply understand the main points of the course and passed exam in a relative simply way .in this case the concepts could not provide me all the necessary information to a full understanding .sometimes could happen the countrary , we can start from theory to understand a fact .everyone knows the story of newton , one red apple on his head represents and important fact : newton learnt this facts and starting from that he introduced the concept of `` gravitation  settin up ideas and concepts in order to explain that facts .galileo galilei , one of the most famous scientist in the history , deals with the importance to support ideas and concepts with facts and experiments that could be replicated several times in order to very and prove the validity of a theory .in conclusion i think that ideas and facts are two aspects of the same `` world  and one can not claim that one aspect is more important than the other , but indeed they live toghter .in my opinion a good student has to pay attention to both of these two aspects if he or she wants to have a full understant of an event .
