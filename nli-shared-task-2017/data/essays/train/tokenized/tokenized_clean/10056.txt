some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .however , in my opinion , traveling alone is a better idea .because i can manage my time by myself and save money .first , i do not want to be controlled my traveling schdule by other people .by traveling alone , i can make my own time schedule for my plan .for example , last year , i went to paris in a group led by a tour guide .first time , i thought it was the best choice for me because i did nt need to book tickets , check the time and look for locations by a map .but after a few days .i realized that i was not the person who just like to follow other people and schedule led by a tour guide .i really wanted to see paintings more in ruvere museum , since there were my favorite master piece such as monarisa .but a tour guide did nt want to spent much time at there .she guided the master peice and gave me only 10 minute .i was so upset and embrassed , as i always eagered to see the work .after the travel , i decided not to go traveling in a group led by a tour guide .in addition , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more expensive that traveiling alone .i compared two cases by a calculate and found that traveling alone is a cheaper choice .i traveled around spain two months ago by myself , then made a chart of spending money .i figured out that by traveling alone i could save more than three hundreds dollars compare to traveling in a group led by a tour guide with the same situation such as traveling same days and visiting same places .if i travel with them , i have to pay for a tour guide and the travel agency .in conclusion , i firmly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best idea .if i have a chance to choose traveling in a group or not , i will choose the last one .as i can controll my plan and my habits and save money .
