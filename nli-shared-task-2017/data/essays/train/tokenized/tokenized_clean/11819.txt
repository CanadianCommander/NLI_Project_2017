most people like doing what they are used to , what they have learned from their family and society over the passed years .this is a good way of living to avoid making any mistakes , and to keep things the traditional way .but the trueth is , only a few people are the ones that take risks in life and make a difference .people openminded , who enjoy exploring and trying new things are the ones who take risks , encourage themselves to try uncommon things and see things in another perspective .this kind of people most of the time find success ; however , some find may it after their death .an example of this would be the famous artist vincent van vough .he was a pioneer in a new painting technique ; he was a great paintor whose work did not have much importance when he was alive .but it was after his death that his work rechead the value it had hidden , and it became famous .an example of a successful person who had reccodmission while alive was the pope john paul ii .he was a brilliant man , that accomplished to do many activities that were not tipically done by a pope .he was the first one that have ever gone to almost every country in the world and he spoke several languages that helped him through all his trips .his charisma was unique , and because of this characteristic he could stablish a sense of brotherhood between catholics and other religions members .successful people are also good role models , not only for young people but to adults too .they show another way of living , probably a more difficult one , but its results are not represeable .i believe that not all humans are destinated to have success , but everybody can try new things .it just needs determination and hard work .
