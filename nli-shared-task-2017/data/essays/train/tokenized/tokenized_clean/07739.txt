i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars for many reasons .the reasons are : the life status would be more expensive , the overcrowding population and the development of new transportation .the first reason is that the life status would be very expensive .as we know when we move on with time life becomes much more expensive .the prices of gas would be higher .in many counties the prices these days are unbelievable .in the next twenty years less people would use cars .they would be aware from the high expenses .the second reason is the overcrowding population .in the future there will be more people .due to this overcrowding , people wont be able to transportate from one place to another easly .less people would have cars and less people would drive because of this over crowding .along with overcrowding .the people will develop and agressive style of driving , it results to that fewer people would use their cars .the third reason is the development of new transportation .scientists are trying to find new methods for transportation .probably in the next twenty years there will be highly advanced transportation that would make people less interested in cars and it would let them get to their destenations faster than cars .there for , due to the reasons i have explaned .people would be less intrested in using cars .the expensive life status , overcrowding population and the development of new transportation would make people try to find other ways to transportate .
