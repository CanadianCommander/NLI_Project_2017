i agree about the saying that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today , because there is more and more pollution in the air and because , in twenty years , new transportation vehicules will be invented .nowadays , there is more and more pollution in the air .in fact , governments and ecologists do their best to eliminate that problem .because cars are one of the biggest problems about pollution s creation that damage our environment , it will be forbidden in the next future to drive cars .pollution destroys our earth and kills about 100 species of animals everyday .moreover , the climate on the earth change dramatically , as a result , our flora and fauna are destroyed .here are some reasons that shows that in twenty years , cars wo nt exist anymore , because of this problem of pollution creation .another reason is that before twenty years , new methods of transportation will be invented .as stated in the first paragraph , cars produce too much pollution .in fact , some people will create an revolutionary method of transportation with an engine consumming water or sunlight , instead of gaz .creating that new accommodation of transportation , its inventor will become rich .as a result , it will encourages people to develop and create something new and special , that will keep the air clean and that wo nt destroy our planet .in conclusion , because of the fact that cars are a major problem of pollution , it will be replaced by a revolutionary method of transportation that will purify the air , as we know it before .we ca nt continue to live as we live today , we have to make a change for letting our children see what a beauty is the earth .we have to stop the killing .
