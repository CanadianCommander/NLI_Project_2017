different people have various opinions about education problems .studying facts has its advantages for students .for example , students can study a lot of thing within short time .studying formulas is the best example .if we study how to soluve problems by certain formulas , we could utlize many problems especially math .however , i strongly agree with the statement .there are more advantages to study concepts for students .the best example , which illustrate my point of view is studying science .when i was a child , my parents encouraged me to have curriousities .they made me to think why the rainbow is coorful and why shapes of the moon is different , and so on .then i tried to figure out the sturucture and elements of them by myself .sometimes i went to library to research and asked professonal people .from this process , i trained an ability of how to soluve problems .this is really important studying for childlen .in spite of this , if students just study facts , they regard the facts without doubtful .as many students study only facts , the new idea and concepts will not be produced .even new technology will not progress at all .and when students encounter problems without abilities of how to soluve the problems , they can not do anything .the my primary consideration with respect to education is studying thinking process and concepts are more inportant than learning facts .
