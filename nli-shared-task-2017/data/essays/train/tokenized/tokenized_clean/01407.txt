the paasage reads that it is the best to travel with conducted group tour led by a guide rather than travel alone .obviouslly , traveling in guided tour can be amusing and safer than single tour especially for those who do not have travel much and do not want take any risks in travelling .nevertheless , i have different ideas to this .first , i believe travel ifself is a teacher of our life .as , during the travel , we get to see lots of differnt people and living enviornments we may have thinking back and forth of our lives in the place we are living and to the people we are interacting about future and the past .thus , it can help grow our thoughts to more delegate and mature to which often group guided tour can not teach as we may spend much of our times with other people in the group and listen to guider all the way of travel .second , travelling alone can have more open chance of unique experience to which group guided tour may not have such as talking with native residents and experiencing unique cultures and foods to which most group tours miss as they tend to focus on what mass tourists like and hear in shallow .for me , while i travelled europe alone in the early 1990s , i got to experience all the newest unique things which nobody did tell me before .it was absolutely unforgettable experiences i have until now .finally , as tour-guide led travel does not require lots of information and tolls we are travelling , even after travel , we become forgetting easily and do not know much about country we had been putting aside of more money it cost as group tour more focus on spendig the money .on the contrary , travel alone does require lots of pre-information , studying , and planning ahead of travel .however once we are back , the outcome we have thourought travel can not be the same of group guided tour .as above , for me travel should not be necessary accompanied by group of people nor amusement should follow .just being alone can match great journey as being good traveller .so , i disagree to the sentenace of favoring guided group tour .
