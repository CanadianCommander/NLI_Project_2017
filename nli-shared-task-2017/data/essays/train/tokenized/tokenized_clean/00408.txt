there is no denying that travelling in group led by a tour guide has become controversal , not only for the professonals but for the public as a whole .some people prefer the travelling that is in group and is led by a guide , and would like to put an end to it , while others do not think this is the best way .as far as i am concerned , i contends that the travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .the reasons supporting my assertion will be shown bleow .first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is funnier .both common sense and our experience have informed us that if many people stay together , they will be happier and can make more funs .for example , when we travel in a group , we can share our funny stories , chat with one anothe , and even play some interesting games .all these activities help us to spend the boring time on the bus or the train .and also , the guide can tell us some interesting local customs which enjoy us .in addition , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer .it is well known that the thieves usually attact the people alone , which situation is eaier for them .while if the tourists are in group , we can look after one another , and also can take care of the belongs when some people go to the washroom .and also , there are some dangers in some resorts , which the guide knows well .in this situation , the guide will remind us to being careful .moreover , travelling in a group led by a tour guide makes us know more about the local culture .we know that the gudie is professional and gets good training about the resorts that we visit .at each resort , the guide will explain the history of it , and even gives some information we can not get from the guide book .thus the explaination made by the guide make our tourist more efficiently .notwithstanding the fact that travelling in a group led by a guide is noisier , this demerit can be compesiated by the many merits associated with the group travelling .beyond the doubt , when the facts are examined , its advantages and disadvantages weighed , and biased opinions casted away , it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that to travel in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel .given the practical realities of the modern society , in fact , not only i prefer the safety , fun , and knowledge brought about by the group travelling , but also i hope that the group members can be quiet some time when some people are tired .
