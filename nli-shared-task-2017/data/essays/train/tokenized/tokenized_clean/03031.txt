i disagree with the statement , that , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the four reasons in support to my view , are discussed below .the first reason , is that young people , are spending more time on various fields of education like medicine and technology .it is with their persistent efforts in these fields that , latest inventions and developments like mobiles , internet , vehicles , vaccines , medicines etc. are being made possible .this , in turn makes the life of the communities more comfortable and happier .the second reason , being the involvement of youth in charity programmes and protests .young people , are have the energy and potent , and thus using it to do some part time activities like stage shows , marketing exhibitions etc .the money that would be collected in these activities , is being diverted to the poor and the needy people in the community .this way the young people are utilizing their leisure time for helping the community .also , the youth are involving in protests , against unjust laws of the government , like reservations for backward classes , improper municipality conditions etc .this way they are representing the problems in the community and protesting for its amelioration .the third , is that the young people organize several get togethers and public functions like new year function , christmas , anniversaries etc , which helps bring the people of a community together .this , not only helps in improving social contacts , but also improves cordial relations among people of the community , so that each of them can help the others , in time of need .the fourth , is that the young people play many kinds of sports .the talented palyers from a particular community , are selected , and they represent the community , in inter-community sports competetions .this way they represent the community and hold up the prestige of their community by playing well and leading the team towards success .thus , the youth do spend time to help their commmunities .
