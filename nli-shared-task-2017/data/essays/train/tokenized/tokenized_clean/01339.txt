i prefer to travel in agroup led by a tour guide .as you know , evrybody can enjyoy a trip evrywhere in this global society , so there are many choices for their own .especially , its deponds on people what kinds of the style they like it .i want to show why i choice the opinion .firsty , it is very convinient if we had a guide .we do nt need to plan ourselves where we go .it sometimes make us stressful and kill a time .the guide know where we want to go and can explain about it perfectly .we can enjoy the trip without worrying .the last time i travel in korea by myself made me so nervous .i could nt speak and read their language , so communication is so important .if i had had a guide , the travel would have changed well .second , if we are a group led by a tour guide , we can exchange information of the travel .the travel will meke up a lot of wonderful excitement .it will be happy if we could share the impression with a group .inaddition this , the guide can show best possition to look at the building if we want to go to the a favorite sites .following the reasons , i agree with the opinion that the best way to travel os on a group led by a tour guide .travel sould enjoy with many people .from my experience , i want to go many travel and talk to friends sharing the memory .that strory lead me another trip .
