there are many impressive advertisements in every countries to make their products look nice .however , i sometimes dissapoint its value when i buy , because it is really different from they are .that s the method of atracting people to buy their goods and that s the only way that people know about the products .in my oppinion , it is important to make goods look nice for sellers because they have to sell products as much as possible because they spend a lot of money for the advertisements .for example , one company which sells goods cheaper than othere companies in japan .they do nt use big advertisements .their goods are worth of the price but it s not atractive at all .for getting customers and improving their quality , it is important to have a advertisements .competition is good for customers , too .it is difficult to know about products without any advertisements because that s the only way to let people get across .it has to be catchy and impressive .if there are same kind of products at the same time , it s difficult to decide which one to buy .i think it is also an important ability to show the products nice for the companies .in conclusion , for these reasons that i mentioned , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it s neccesary for the modern society s competition .
