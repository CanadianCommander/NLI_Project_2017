i think that young people would enjoy more than old .i didnot want to stick upon it .older people are once young only , so they have enoy their teenage life .young ones have no responsibility about the family .they will have no tensions .older ones have family tensions and they are now aged , so they donot have that zeal anymore .for young ones they will try to do everything new and which is intersting .the examples for such situations are they just take part in rock climbing and they participitate on having a roadies show .they are many things student or young ones perform in day to day life .enjoying life does seem to participitate in cultural activities .some may prefer having as many as girlfriends as a meaningful one to their position etc .the older ones will get so much tired and they probably have several health problems .taking guidance to their children about stiudies and different persecptives of them and to look about their health .they probably will have no time in doing other activites othe than these which are enjoyable .young ones have no certain problems in it .but they have to study as well as enjoying .the family responsibilities would depend on him so much .by experience i noticed t older ones also enjoy , but to a little extent rather than young ones .
