i totally agree with this statement .we are in an incredible period of time that technology is growing too fast .this brings some consequences and influences in all things .the vehicles , especially cars are one of those things .firstly , i think the use of the public tansportation will get higher .the high technology provides us to improve the qualifications of the vehicles that we are already used .for example , because of the speed of the trains , subways and plains , people prefer to use this kind of vehicles .they will not want to take the risk of being late for anything .secondly , the high rate of the accident of cars will lead people to invent some solutions about that .using the high technology , they will create some other vehicles other than those we use recently .for example ; the vehicles which will be used for the transportation through the air or under see and which are more safe than using a car .these situations cause people to reach anywhere more fast and more safely .lastly , dispite of the high technology , people may prefer basic vehicles for transportation like bycels .the arrangement of the roads and bridges will be better completed
