i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to help their communities .first , with the pressure increasing , some students focus on their studies most of the time .for example , in our country , we have to get up around 6 oclock and go to school at 7 .and most of us will go to cram school after school .the time that we arrive home is around 10p.m.we also have a lot of work to do at home .so we do nt have enough time for sleeping , needless to say helping our community .besides , most of young people now are more care about themselves .they work part-time jobs very hard to earn money to make themselves prettier or buy more things they like .they even do nt care about their parents .what their communities become is not a big deal .it is common to see that someone calling help on the street but no one gives a hand .also , most young people just know how to play computer games or watch tv .they do nt know how to clean their bedroom , pick up trashes on the street or take care of others .if they have free time , they will plan to hang out with their friends instead of helping their communities .however , they do nt know that by helpning communities can make them learn more .communities are just like a small scociety .helping each others , especially in your neighborhood , can earn a lot of precious experiences that may use in the future .there is no doubt that teenagers do nt give enough time to help their communities .this may become a serious problem that need more concerns of our scociety .
