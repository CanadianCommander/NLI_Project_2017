do i agree or disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?is it widely known that prograss of technology is astonishing immensely ?as far as i am concerned , i believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are now .in addition , i will argue over the case with the following reasons .first of all , i think that there will be more and more high-tech cars which will be invented in the future .for example , when i was a child , my father always put a map in the car .every time we visited certain strange place , my mother would check the map , and pointed the correct direction for my father .now , almost every cars have a electric map .it will automatically tell us how to arrive the place which we want to arrive .i think that the more high-tech service cars have , the more cars people will buy .secondly , i find that there will be more and more roads which will be build in the future .there are still many place without appropriate roads for cars .however , i believe that this problem will be solve in a few years .for instance , there are still a lot of place which chinese government does nt develope .but i believe that chinese government will develope them as soon as possible .the reasons are not only they want to decrease the disparity of wealth , but also they want to develpe their tourism .because there will be more and more roads will be build well , there will be more and more cars which people will want to have .to sum up , i believe that after twenty years there will be more cars than nowaday .because there will be many high-tech cars will be produced , and there will be more roads will be constructed well in the future .in the end , i will conclude my decision by emphasizing that there will be more high-tech cars which will dirve us to arrive more strange place in the future .
