i definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , rather then specialising in one specific subject .firstly , in my opi it is necessary to have a broad view on a variety of subjects in order to understand our increasingly complex world .secondly , innovation , whether in the fields of science , business or politics , is often lead by people who have a cross-funtional view .to begin with , the primary purpose of education is to prepare students to face the world with the right skills and knowledge .the world we live in , it turns out , is increasingly complex .in order to succeed in this world , it is necessary to have a broad understanding of several subjects .for example , an engineer can not rely only on its engineering skills but should also communicate on what he is doing , as most of the great technical achievements of our times rely on a team rather then a single person .then , a lot of innovations result from applying a principle or idea taken from one field and applying it to another , which can only be achieved by people who have a broad understanding of several fields .the post-it is a good illustration .it has become a popular and useful item in offices but it actually results from the invention of a glue that did not fix well enough to be used in a traditional way !another striking example is the bridge that was created between computer science and biology in the invention of neuronal programming .neuronal programming simulates the mechanisms of the nervous cells of the brain , enabling the programme to learn .as a conclusion , i think that students benefit from having a broad knowledge of several subjects , because it helps them to tackle with the challenges of our modern world , whether as leaders or as innovators .of course , this should not prevent them from acquiring more extensive knowledge in a specific field .
