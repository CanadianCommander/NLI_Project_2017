transportation has been one of the most important factor in human civilization .according to the history book , roman empire became so powerful and managed to rule a large land because they created road .later , european countries could create many colonies because they rule the world s ocean with great ships .now , in this modern era car is the most important transportation .we still use ships and airplains which are far more advanced than vehicles , but they can not be owned easily by many people because of high prices .for now , car is the main transportation system in the world .will there be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years ?for now , it is not possible because there is no reason for us to change our current transportation .only problem with current transportation system is `` fuel  .it needs gas , but gas is limited .but last decade , researchers have developed new types of fuels for car such as sun light , water , and electricity , and these new inventions are starting to replace old cars that run with gas , and we do not use as much gas as we used to compard to the past .there is no way that number of cars will be decreased in twenty years .only way to decrease the number of cars that are owned by people , is an involvement of government .first , government can increase tax .in many nations , one family owns more than one car based on statistics .by increasing tax rate , families wo nt be able to keep as many cars as today .second , if government supports the local transportation companies financially or perhaps creates government owned transportation companies , it might lower the numbers of cars that are owned by individuals by giving them more choice of transportation .many nations around the world have a great transporation system , but there are still some countries that do not have enough finance power to s from my perspective , there wo nt be fewer cars in use than today unless the government get involved with transporation system in the societyy .
