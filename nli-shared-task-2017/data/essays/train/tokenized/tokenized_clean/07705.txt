it may depend on what kind of field or job these successuful people are involved in .if they are involved in a business industy that requires rapid update and application of creative ideas such as computer or car industry , i agree that sucessful people tend to try new things and take risk rather than doing what they alreayd know how to do well .successful people in these fields make a lot of money from successful business .for example , bill gates is known to be very rich person in the world as a founder of microsoft company .but his company is consistently trying to update the existing computer system or invent innovative new system , rather than staying as they are .it may apply to most of the big companies that produce brand name products , including vehicles and electronics .they spend large amount of money for research for the new and better product .this kind of investment can be considered as taking risks .because they may not come up with better product as a result of research and may take a lot longer time to generate better product than they planned .however , there is a chance to produce product with much more improved quality and this may lead to more successful business .on the other hand , people that are considered as successful as working in traditionally respected professions , such as doctors or professors , they may not have to take much risks to stay successful .becasue their means of making money-treating patients or teaching students-do nt change fast .although they may have to keep up with a new trend of field needing to modify their methods .therefore , it may depend on the profession or business where they are involved inwhether they have a tendency to take a risk or not .
