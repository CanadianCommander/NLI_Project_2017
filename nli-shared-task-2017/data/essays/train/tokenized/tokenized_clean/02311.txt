advertising , effective marketing are the big buzz words which everyone in the field of business talk about .but in reality how good are these products , is the big question that needs to be answered .the mantra for any advertising is to make a product sell and increase sales , in this process some of the ethical issues remain unanswered .for example , lot of the food products which are advertised do not specify the contents in them .some ingredients may be harmful for children .this ineffective and hidden advertising is harmful and in the long run does more damage than gain to the company .with the advent of advertising on televison , the way the product is perceived has been totally changed .with newer technology in the media industry , it is questionable if the product we get is what we see !in a lot of occassions , food products have been made to look lot more appealing to the eye , this kind of visual stimulus in deed sells product , but is it really right ?i really dont think so , this this just an illusion which has been created and camoflauges the actual product and deceives the consumer .another major thing and the big talk of the present day is obesity and it s harmful effects .a lot of commercials from exercise equipment to health foods have been exploiting this concept .the socailites and other personalities emdorse the products and sometimes are paid hefty for these endorsements .there have been talks about celebrities overeating and then on a diet with an endorsed product just to promote it .this kind of wrong advertising causes more harm to the public who try to follow and rely on this information .hidden facts is another way which ads make the products seem larger , this is esp seen again with health equipment .the exact duration of performing the exercises and the assocaited diet modifications are seldom mentioned .this when seen by the public is perceived big and hence the result is the same health status iof the indivudual or even worsening .another example of this would be the fuel efficiency in cars , which is advertised as very efficient and the best milage on testing road conditons , but in reality with the bad roads and stops at traffic lights , this efficiency is never achieved !another wrong concept of advertising is the comparing of the rival products and degrading them in comparison with theirs .the customer should be given the choices and make his decision , rather than imposing the ideas .publically or through media showing comparison of their company product another is always wrong .it is obvious that to promote their product the harmful effects of it , or the drawbacks are never mentioned .this is unethical and not acceptable in advertising .the comparison should always be left to unbiased bodies , who would be better judges .advertising is the biggest way an economy can be influenced , it would be more beneficient if it is done more positively .this would benefit the public using the products and the company which makes them and in turn would finally build up the economy .
