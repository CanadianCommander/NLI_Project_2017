there are studenst in the world .they want to learn something from their teachers or their families to become success .if a student want to resolve the situation to become sucess , he/she must know the idea .understanding ideas is more important than learning facts for students because of the features and the usages .students want to know the specialities of the idea and concepts .specialities show where the topic comes from .for example turks are living in a democratic city .if they do not know their past they can not know the importance of that democracy .for this reason people learn their past and their history .if people can not know their past and they live in domocratic country .they can not discuss or protest something is oppsed to their country .they must know how they become in this situation and they can use it if it is necessary .knowing specialities means that knowinf ideas and concepts .understanding what the idea is about is necessary for learning something .if a student start to learn something first of all she/he must know the name of the idea and than the information about the idea for using it .if she do not know anything about that she/he can not realise the facts .facts can only demonstrate the results but to understanding well it is not enough .for example there is oss in turkey and the students study oss for getting a chance to pass a good university .i studied too and i learned the idea and concepts .if i learn only the facts i can forget the facts during the oss .understanding facts means memorizing because we can not know the idea .we can only know the fact and this is not enough .for this reason teachers explain the topics with their concepts and ideas .so the students can know the fact whenever they want because understanding ideas pass the people to the facts .to summerize understanding ideas is important for remember and using ideas .
