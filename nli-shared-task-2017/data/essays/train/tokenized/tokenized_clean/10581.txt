while some people may believe that most advertisements can make products seem much more attractive than the really are , i feel that some cases can be made for the other opinion against that augument .in short , i disagree with the statement .it is true that some advertisement can do it .for example , the enegy drink in japn is typical product .the ingredients of those dirnks are usually only sweet water with some caffein .but people are made to believe that they can get energetic by drinking them via advertisements .by contrasts , there are also opposite case to the effect of advertisements .as a matter of fact , i can reffer to the case of pocali sweat which is the most famous sports drink in japan .for japanese people , pocali sweat sounds fresh , healthy , and sporty .the advertisements of the drink emphisized these image on tv and so on .however , when the maker of this drink expanded the market to outside japan , the company was obliged to recognized the problem .because the word `` sweat  does not sound good for english speakers , the maker has failed to advertise the product successufully , what is worse , the advertisement has harmed its image .as another example , i have personal experience regarding advertisement .in my school days , i opened the food stand and sold ethnic meals in the festeval .then , i have just emphisezed the ethnic trait of the meals , but have failed to convey the image of deliciousness .to sum up , because the fact mentioned above , i do not think most advertisements are always effective to make products seem much better than they really are .
