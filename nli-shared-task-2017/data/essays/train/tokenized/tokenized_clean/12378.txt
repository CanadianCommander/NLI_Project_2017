there are various methods that could be used in order for a student to learn new informations .some students would choose to deeply understand ideas and concepts while others would choose to learn facts withoud a deep understanding of them .personnaly , i would definitely choose the first method which is a deep understanding of ideas and concepts .i truly think that it is much more benificial to understand rather than to learn .first , i would say that this method is a very intersting one because when you understand something , you get intersted and fascinated about it and about the way it works .let s take the example of a physics course .i think that a student would be much more intersted by understanding a physic concept for example the way cellphone works rather than learning by heart some facts or conlusion .in addition , i am highly convinced that when you learn things by heart without really understanding them , you tend to forget them very fast , so you would have studied these facts for nothing .it would have simply been a loss of time .futher more i would add that understanding ideas could be very beneficial for the daily life .let s take another physic example which is electricty .when you learn how elctricity works you are then able to deal with any electrical problem that you could face while you are at home , and would nt be using the help of an electrician .however if a person has just learned some facts about electricity , it would then be difficult for her to soplve her problem without the help of someone else .finally , i think that the more you understand a subject , the more professionnal you become in this domain .and this is how we ll be able to evolve , and make new discoveries that could be very beneficial for evryone .in conclusion , i would say that it is way important for students to understand ideas and concept than it for them to simply learn facts .a deep understanding of a subject could be much more beneficial than a simple learning of facts .
