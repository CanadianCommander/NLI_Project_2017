i agree with this statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .there are two reasons to support .first of all , it will be boring for them to learn only the fact .if the student just only learn the fact , they will be satisfied with their knowledge and wo nt try to think any more .thinking is a important process to improve their knowledge .if they just learn the fact , they do nt need to think why it happened or how it happened .they will just know the answer right away without thinking .in fact , thinking is exciting .when they learn an idea , they will try to use it in many situations .for example , when students learn about static electricity , they will try to make electirical shocks by rubbing objects and find out which objects makes the most electricity .they are thinking and also enjoying the method .but if they know the fact , they will just chose the right object and done .that is very boring .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts are very important .from my experience , i really think so .when i was playing basketball in middle school , i just did as the coach said to me during practice .i did nt really think about why are we doing this practice and just did as we were told to do .but as time goes by , our team became weaker and weaker .we searched for the reason .finally we found out the reason .every practice we did had a meaning .we were nt just running , we were running as if we are in the game .we were nt just shooting , we were shooting as if there are opponents blocking .we were just doing the fact that the coach said but we should have understand the idea and concepts of the practice .after we noticed the fact , we started to work hard and we became the second place in the competition .i was really happy and thanked the coach for teaching us for not telling the answer and made us think by ourseves .from this experience , i learned that understanding ideas and concepts are far more important that learning facts .this is why i agree with this statement .
