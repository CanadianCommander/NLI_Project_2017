very a lot of sucessful , or better called rich , persons try new things and risks because the need or want a new opportiunity to get more money or respect than other people .the people who dont want to change anything in their life are happy with their life now .but the sucessful persons want to rise up her personal abilities .so thez want to get ore money , a higher social life or a development of their own personality .but in the most cases the biggest role plays the money .people want to get always more of it .for example , at the big boom of the financial trade papers before ca .5 years a lot of people want to buy and to trade with this papers and give a lot of their money to many different tade papers .so many people made much money with this deals but also some people had loosen everything .and therefore the population registrates the sucessful people because they have much money and common people are interested in those people because they want to know , for example , what the rich persons will do with this money and they think also that richer people are more happy than `` normal  people who have not so much money as the rich ones .but in the financial paper case there were a lot of people who loose a lot of their money or sometimes everything .but nobody knows something about them because they do not get much puplicity or stand in the newspapers or in the internet or somewhere else .so you think that when you take risks on you you will more sucessfully than other people but it can also go in the wrong way and you will not be sucessful .so you have to think well about the solutions of the risks and you should not handle to the opinion of another person because it is your money or something else .
