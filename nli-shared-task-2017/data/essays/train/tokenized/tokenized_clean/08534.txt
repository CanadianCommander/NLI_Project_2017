for some reasons i totally agree with the statement , although sometimes risk can destroy a people , it is a part that people must go trough to get succeed .first , if someone wants to be succeed , he or she must try to do something new , something others never did before , it is just like invention , new things are always the things people focus on , that is why people are interest on new cell phones and computers but not regular phones and calculators , the future successful people has to find something that can interest people , but as an addition , there are always risks while introducing a new product or working in a new field , but if people want to recieve , they have to give , people who want to be succeed must give up doing the thing they already know how to do well , but learn to do a new thing , for most times , there are nt even books to introduce how to do the new thing , but once one people finds out how to do and does it well , he or she may be secceed throughtout one night .many people surround me are worrying about their jobs , some because they ca nt find a job , some worries about how far they can go in their career , for those who want to be more excellent than others , who are looking forward to be successful people , wo nt only try to do better than others in the same thing , because as people always say ` what you can do , others can do  , take bill gates for example , when he was determind to found a software company he was only an college student , bravely , he did nt scared by the risk but went out from the college to the true world to discover new things , to chase new goals , at the time he had a friend who ahd the same major as bill did , rejected the invetion of bill gates to found a new company together , may be he thought it is more unrisky to continue his study , or maybe he still thinks so now , but after years , bill gates becomes , we can say a legent of success , every body admire him , and seeking for ways to be as successful as him , and his classmate at college i ve mentioned before , is now a college proffessor , i m not saying that being a proffesor is not successful , it is also a marvolous job , but in most people s opinion , being best one in the world , is cooler , and a people like bill gates , is the most successful one .it may depends on that kind of life people want , but if people want to bu really successful , i think the best way is to face the risks and do new things others never did before , there sure will be failures , but if he or she succeed , it will be a huge pride .
