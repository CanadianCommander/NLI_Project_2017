the most common idea of marketing is `` to sell the product at any cost  .and as advertisement , as well as in tv as in newspapers , is a way of marketing , the goal is also pretty clear .they want to show their product from its best side .who would buy a burger if it looks like crap .for example an advertisement from burger king , to continue with the `` burger business  .the company is now marketing its newest burger , the cheesy bacon xxl .you see their advertisement and absolutely want to eat that burger immediately .but why is that so ?because they will show you a situation of complete satisfaction .everybody is happy and everybody eats that burger that looks so good .maybe they are also singing a song which is easy to remember and hard to forget , so that you will keep that advertisement in mind , for a very long time .but after a while , you are thinking about that burger again , but the only things you remember , are the happy people , who are singing this song , and that makes you feel good .you probably think you will be as happy as the people in the commercial if you eat that burger .another example is definitely the car companies .there is probably no other branch , which is paying so much money for their marketing .but the principles are the same as it is with burger king .you have to attract people and show your product from it s best side , thats all what matters primarily .lets just have a look at the new mercedes-benz e-class .somehow they say its the now model but there are only some small differences between the new and the old one .but even though , the commercial is so good , that i love that car .because they had maybe some special effects or a cool music in the background .these are the things that matter .if the product is really awsome does nt really matter in an good advertisement .so the quote is true , that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .but there are so many indepedent sources which will give you clear information about a product , that it does nt really matter .
