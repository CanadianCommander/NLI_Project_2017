i agree with the statement wich deals with the importance for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .since students chilhood , teachers teach in a way of developing students brains and so their own ideas .the behavior of teachers is to push students to develop their own analysis about different subject more or less important .but the aim is to increase some capability to think by themselves and not discuss about a subject only in telling the facts he or she learns before witout any construction in their comment or their way of thinking .if a student studies scientific subjects for instance , he or she needs to have a certain knowledge that is to say , he or she needs to learn theories and history of the subject .he or she can not have a right thinking before learning how to understand ideas and concepts .a student can not talk about facts without having a minimum of knowledge .he or she would be lost .this example is also available when a student has to comment current events about news on televison .if news deals with politics and the role of the government or the whole political organization , the student has to understand ideas and concepts of different parties of the government for instance , in order to understand better and to be able to learn more easily the facts of the society and understand why the society react in this way .if students would be more encouraged to learn facts first of all , it could be a little bit `` dangerous  for them because their own way of critic could be affected whatever the subject is .finally learning is in gerenal more based on knowledge that teachers can give to their students in order to improve and develop their critical analysis .
