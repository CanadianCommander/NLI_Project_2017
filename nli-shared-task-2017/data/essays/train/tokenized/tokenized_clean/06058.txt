my personal thought is that it depends on the situations of the students to understand the ideas of a topic or just learn some facts about it .i have some good examples for both of the thoughts which explains why i think that this statement depends on situations .i have several reasons to thin that a student needs to understand a topic completely .my first reason to think like this because of the kinds of the topics .there are different kinds of topics .some are not important for any parts in our life ; some are the base of the complex topics and some are significant topics which will come up in your life .the students need to understand the topics that are base of some complex and significant topics in order to understand the upcoming main topics .the reason is clear in my opinion .if you understand the base of a topic clearly ; you will not have any trouble in understanding the complex and important things about that topic and will not have hard times about some simple things in hard and complex topics .a student needs to understand the significant and hard topics too in the sense of being succesful as both a student and a bussinesman .when you are a student ; you need to understand the topics inorder to do well in the exams about the hard topics .so the student will not have any problems when he is working professionaly in a company when a task about that topic comes up .on the other hand ; i would suggest the students to learn the facts only if the topics do not have any importance at all .by this way , the student will succeed the exam because he knows the basic facts of the topic , but will not lose some important time by understanding the topic .in conclusion ; i can say that my opinion is in the way that a student should understand the topics except than the ones that do not have any importance in life and only for the period of classtime in the school .
