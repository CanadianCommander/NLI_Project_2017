i totally disagree we as the youth give our time to help out the communitiey .well people might seem like they do nt care but they do novadays people think that caring and feeling strongly about something is a sing of weakness well i beg to differ .there are tons of great examples of how the young people misbehave but remember although they might be young they are referred to as ` people  therefore they should be threated as such .as you might remember just a couple of years ago there was this huge concert held in couple of diffrent places called ` live 8  just just like angels from above these thousands of selfless youngsters came from all around the world not to see their favourite singers , bands and etc. to perform but to give the less fortunate ones another chance to ` make poverty history  what day said .that is a perfect example of how much young people care about their surroundings .i for an example do charity on a regular basis for example not because i want to but because i should i sometimes go out with less pretty girls it doesnt make me more popular but it helps girls feel confident of them selves .now if that is not caring and helping i do nt know what is .once a great man said ` we are the world we are the children  as much as i dispise the man who said it i have to agree children are our future and if people have problems with the way they behave remember it s becasue of how your generation effected our s .to sum up young people know are as caring to their surroundings as you are because thats what they learned from you and that is exactly how you learned from your fathers and mothers .but we will break the chain thus once againg prooving my point that we are infact caring and helping .
