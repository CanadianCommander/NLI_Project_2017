i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is group tourings led by a guide .of course , group touring can give several benefits : proving some good informations , making friends with peopel with different background , etc .but as far as i am concerned , i believe that it is best to travel alone or travel with a few friends .first of all , i like organizing tour schedule and preparing for travels .i search good informations about my touring in the web sites .we can have a lot of valuable information about cheap price hotels , affordable rent cars , or wonderful sightseeings .in contrast , a group tour ususally makes me be very passive .i do nt like being passive .secondly , i feel more free and comfortable when i prepare for my own travel .group travel ususally provides rigid time schedul and travel itinery .but i enjoying freely choosing our schedul and places to visit .our schedul always can be adjusted based on our situations .thridly , i love driving my car when i make a trip to historical sites , parks and mountaints with beautifual scenary , or cutting-edgy cities such as new york , l.a .in contrast , i can not drive cars when i become a member of group tour guided by a tour guide .driving cars , especially in the highways , makes me feel relax and happy .finally , i do nt think that group touring provide cheap prices .it usually need a lot of money to participate in group travel .i believe , preparing our own travel can help us save a lot of money .to sum up , group touring is not best option for me because it makes me feel more passive , less freee , and very often the price is so expensive .i prefer traveling based on my own schedul and plan .
