is it better to know a little bit of everything or to know everything about a special subject ?certainly many students have already given this question a fair amount of thought .but maybe there is no need for an either / or decision as both approaches to knowledge have their advantage in academic life .to advance academic research , you need specialized knowledge in your specific research area .before you can for instance tackle new approaches to cancer treatment , you need to know all there is available on your specific subject as a starting point of tought and to form a new and sound hypothesis .many processes are highly detailed and not easy to grasp quickly and therefore need an intense effort on the researchers  side .you do also need broad knowledge of many other academic subjects in order to function well in the everyday academic life .in order to communicate with other researchers , you need to know at least the concepts of their research subjects .broad knowledge also hepls when it comes to making your research results understandable to an audience who is not familiar with your specific topic .and lastly , broader knowledge helps you seeing the overall picture and patterns that you would miss when you only concentrated on your specific subject .a balance of in-depth knowledge and broad overview is certainly a good basis for meaningful and sustainable research .broad knowledge helps you to discovering the general patterns and also communicating with your peers .specialiced knowledge helps you to penetrate the problem more profoundly .
