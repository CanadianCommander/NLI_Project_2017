successful people are really try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .we live in an amazing world .things change , people change .how could be successful if you just go along the road that all the people already know how to do well .yes , it s true that some things and rules are still right .people need to eat everyday , so i open a resteraunt .so how could not i make money .but when others run it too , how could you make sure that you can still make money .so you need to change , you need to try new things , you need to take risks , or others will change , and then , you just destroy yourselves .who knows that computers will become extremely popular several decades ago .and people just thought that the bill gates person was so stupid .what if he go and see and do some law things his fathers just wished rather than trying new things and take the big risks to go on with his computer and softwares .well we may ca nt fly into the sky some years ago , but after the brothers used their lives to take the risk , you see what we can do now .no risks , no win .that s our chinese old words .without the risks , how could we see the new country in the north ameria land .maybe some works do not change , but the way we do them must be changed .if there are no the new things , how could the world develop itself .all the things are still same as a couple of years ago , the shop is still the shop , the stuffs you can buy are still them , i can not imagine that .
