in twenty years , the world will have evoluated .the transports will be more developed and high tech .nevertheless , we can ask us if the car will be also important than today or more .nowadays , the car enables to see the social level of someone even if some people spend more money than they have .but , the car is more and more crticized for many reasons : there are too many cars in the towns , that polluates the environment and it kills a lot of people .indeed , this year , observators have seen than people were nt ready to spend a lot of money in the car .it shows that mentalities move .on the other part , the common transports are more and more efficiency .lot of efforts are done for citizens circulate more easily and more quickly , in the best conditions .a town like bordeaux , for example , has discreased the number of the streets for the cars to enable the construction of the tramway .all is done to reduce the circulation in the towns .there is also the fact that families prefer spend their money to buy something for their house .the confort at home is more important than before .people are more ofte in their house and want to have what is the best for their confort .it s for these reasons i think in twenty years there will be less cars than there are today .people will use common transports and will have alone one car , and not two cars as we can see it in few families .
