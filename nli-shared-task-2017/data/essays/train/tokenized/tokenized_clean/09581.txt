for an estudent , it s important to learn facts and also to undestand ideas and concept .but , i totaly agree with the statement that is more important to students to understand the concepts , than is for the to learn the facts .i think this way , mainly because by understanting the concepts and ideas , you are really getting the basis of knowlege ( you can go to the deeps of it ) .it s the only way to go to the bottom on the issues .if you just learn a memorize the facts ( and leave the undestanding of concepts behind ) , you wo nt be able to innovate .i think facts are the starting point .by revising and questioning those facts and working based on them , knowing their cause and effect is the key .the only way to do this , is by the understanting of the ideas and concepts that lead to those facts .in other words , if you just learn the facts and do nt know where the came from , you wo nt be a complete all-arround student , just memorizing machine .the great human minds over the course of history , have been well knowned for understanding the ideas they worked on .albert einstein once said : `` you realy do nt know something , until you re able to explaining it to your grandmother ...  , meaning that the only way teach something in a way anyone can follow , is putting it in simple form .the way to achive this , is by dominating the concepts and ideas well ( knowing where they come from , so you can put it in different words ) .try to picture einstin explaning to his grandmother one of his teories , just giving her the facts . ..in resume , undestanding the ideas and concepts ( what they really mean , where they come from , ect . )is by far more important tha just learning the facts .facts are important , but no
