there is no denying that whether young people enjoy their lives more than the older people do has become controversial , not only to professionals , but also to the public as a whole .it takes all sorts to make the world .some believe that young people enjoy their lives more than the older , and would like to put an end to it , while others who think older people enjoy their lives more maintain the disagreement to it .as far as i am concerned , i vote for the latter .there are numerous reasons why i choose to disagree with the given statement , and i would in here explain a few of the most important ones .in the first place , it is easily observed in modern society , young people have to endure more pressure and competition that older people do .both common sense and our knowledge can inform us that most young people have to deal with peer-pressure .what s more , in order to survive later in their lives , they are facing enormous competition with other youngsters .an illustrative example that can be easily found .high school students have to worry and struggle for their marks in order to acquire an considerablely good education .in contrast , old people just need to go to community centres and enjoy their lives .after all things considerred , i think the most important reason for stating older people enjoy their lives more is that they are respected by younger people .in other words , their lives are more appreaciated and high-classed emotionally and psychologically .an example that accompnies this point is that a senior with a family can be respected by his/her children or even grandchildren .according to a recent survey by statistic canada , 80 % people whose ages are below 30 believe that older people should be respected and 90 % of those who are older think they are happy and appreaciative about the respect they get from young people .nevertheless , young people s lives can be more enjoyable to some extent , such as a higher energy level they obtain in their daily lives , but this merit is speculative .after considerring the bigger picture , you will think believing older people have better lives is a wise option .after understanding all the reasoning above , it is now safe to say that stating older people s lives are more enjoyable is a more sagacious and wise action .
