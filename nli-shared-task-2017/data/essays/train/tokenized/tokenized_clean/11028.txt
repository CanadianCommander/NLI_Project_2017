`` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in the present day there are too many cars too less parking spaces and the roads are being crowded because of this reason .to avoid such disruptions one possible way is to have fewer cars in use after twenty years than there are today .the main disadvantage of too many cars is pollution both air and noise .another problem is accidents involving cars especially have increased over the past few years .the declining of the fossil fuels and petroleum produst might be another reason for decreasing the number of cars .decreasing the number of cars would decrease trafic and people would be able to travel easily .in future it would enable us to reduce pollution caused by cars mainly air pollution .this is because air pollution is one of the causes for ozone depletion resulting global warming .many trees are cut for increasing parking spaces or making new roads which increases global warming .but if there are fewer cars more trees can be planted .noise pollution will reduce automatically with the use of fewer cars and may infact not exist any more .car accidents are increasing because of reckless driving or driving the car under influence of alcohol or drugs .people who own cars do not feel resposible to anyone and hence some of them do not follw trafic rules such as wearing the seat belts .not only the person commiting the mistake is paying but also other people who are on the same road as the person commiting the mistake .most of the time these accidents are due to teenagers or students who just got their license ( some may drive without a license ) .all such things could be avoided if there were fewer cars which belonged only to responsible people .fossil fuels and petroleum products have been depleting very rapidly over the past few years in the western countries and it has become very costly to buy it from middle-eastern countries .hence limited number of cars would help in saving the remaining fossil fuels and also avert many other disasters caused because of cars .
