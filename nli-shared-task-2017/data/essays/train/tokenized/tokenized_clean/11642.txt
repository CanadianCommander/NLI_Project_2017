i believe that it is better for people to have broad understanding of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because a wide scope of knowledge in various academic subjects is required for multi-tasking , for maturing into a knowledgeful person , and for conducting specific tasks efficiently .firstly , due to the changes in the business enviornment , employees are required to carry out various tasks at which they may not have specialized .for instance , a business manager is required to facilitate stratergy formations which requires an understanding of various subjects such as finance , accounts , operations and human resource .secondly , knowledge is a vital component for a person to mature .maturity does not come only from age and wisdom but also from an understanding of various topics that may not be necessary for fulfilling the tasks in a job description .for instance , a person needs to have an understanding of biology and chemistry to either consume over-the-counter medicines or prescribe them to thier relatives .the very same person could be working as a receptionist at an hotel where no information on chemistry or biology would be required to fulfill the tasks in the job description .lastly , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help an inidivual to conduct a specific task more efficiently .for example , a marketing manager will be required to be knowledgeable about technology , finance , and accounts in order to form marketing plans and budgets .without the knowledge about these subjects , the marketing manager will not be able to complete his or her task efficiently .in conclusion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because broad knowledge will enable a person to multi-task , to develop into a more wise and mature individual , and to conduct various tasks with ease and efficiency .
