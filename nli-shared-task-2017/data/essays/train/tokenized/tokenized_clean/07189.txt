traveling around the world should be a great experience because it is the time to meet people and to discover a new country .i definately disagree with the idea of traveling in group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .regarding to my experience , i am sure that the best way to travel is with people that you love and visit the places which are not all the time indicated .first of all , every time i have traveled in a foreign contry , i was with my friends or with my family and i have appreciated my trip better , because i was with people who i love to share my time with .when you travel with a group you do not know the people with who you are , and this situation can be the appropriate time to have new friends , but for me , having a friend is a long story which can be counted in years .in my opinion spend my money to visit a new place is the time to share very good moment in a new atmosphere with my family and friends who know me .when i went to italy it was with my best friend and i could appreciate much better this wonderful place .last but not least , when you travel with a tour guide you have to follow their rules whom is exactly what i dislike to do during my vacation because i must follow the rules all the time during my daily life .tour guide has already a planning and personaly i love the idea to do not know what i am going to do the day after .this sensation is a wonderful sensation of freedom .furthermor , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to miss the best places because i am sure that every countries have is spirit , which can be discovered only if you spend your time with the population and visit with their own eyes .in conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way for me to visit a new place , because you have to follow their rules and because you do not know people of the group .
