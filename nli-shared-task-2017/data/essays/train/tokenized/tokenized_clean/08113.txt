i personally disagree with the given statement .in my opinion there is only a different way to enjoy the life between yougers and olders .young people are in the beginning of their life and they have still so much to try that they are attracted to the more exstavagant things to do .also substained by their young age and lower experience they can afford more risk and try situations that make their adrenalin level to the top .but all of this is only giuded by their desire to become experienced about life , this is not a real more enjoyng way of life .the older part of the society does not spend a sad life .they have tried all that emotions in the past and now they can enjoy through others experiences .with many resposabilities to take care of , they can now get their enjoyment from what they have built , their families , their social relationship lasted many years , their jobs and so on .i do not think this is boring or less enjoying .may be the difference that many underlines is in the impact of the two kinds of enjoyment .it is clear that what a boy do is spectacularly enjoying , i do not want to say it is not , but also the style of living fo an adult can offer a real enjoyment , just a different kind and perhaps more deeper in the soul .in conclusion we can not do a garduatory about what gives us more enjoyment but , in a easier way of thinking , i want to say that every age has its own enjoyment , the problem is only how to catch it .
