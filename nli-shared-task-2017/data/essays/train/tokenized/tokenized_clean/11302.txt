in fact , i do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .what is the reason to support my point ?in the point of the company , the purpose of advertisements is to promote their products .of course they will advertise their products perfect to attract more customers to purchase them .only in that way , they could gain more benifit to their company .so here comes the trickness .instead of telling the weakness of thier products to the customers , the company just repeats the goodness of them .after all , the expence of the advertisements and marketing is extremely high .for instance , the cost of advertisement in tv is charged per second .in order to reach the best profit , absolutely they must make the products the best .therefore , it would not hard to understand that why products seem so wonderful in the advertisement .in other way , customers chose what they are going to buy by the introduction of advertisement .as what we mentions about the company s concern , it is a huge difference between what customer needs and what company wants !so what is the best way for both customers and companies ?it would be better if customers could check the detailed more deeply before buying the products and the company should tell us more during theadvitisement
