i do not agree with the statement that ` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts` .i dont think that you can understand ideas or concepts of something when you do not learn the facts .facts are more important than ideas .they should both know the facts and concepts about something so they can analyse the situation themselves .they can not know something by not learning the facts .they can not be completely concious about a subject if they do not know the fact .the only thing they know is the ideas about it .i also think that just understanding concept and not learning fact , do not encourage students to observe or investigate .we all just learn to understand others  ideas .maybe i would not agree with those ideas if i had known more about it .you can not ask questions about things that you dont know what the facts is .hence just understanding ideas will not let us asking questions .mostly in history lesson we only understand ideas or concepts about lots of things that we can never be sure if it is the truth or not .also i know it is hard to know all facts about history but i just wish i could .beside all those above by thinking as the meanings .fact means something totally objective and can not be changed .however idea is opinions of other people and mostly are subjective .the facts are always objective .so it is more reliable .to put it in a nutshell for being more objective , asking more questions about and making the situation more understanable for ourselves we should learn the facts .
