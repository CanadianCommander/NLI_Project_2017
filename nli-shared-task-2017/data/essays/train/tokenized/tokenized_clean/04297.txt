the topic given has its own intricacies , and to justify and convinced with a thought , we have to comprehend the rudiments of learning process .i agree with the point presented that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning the facts .to understand a subject , one should have strong basics about the idea and concept behind it .for instace , if we take physics class , students should be well aware of principle of aerodynamics before they learn the facts about a rocket or an aeroplane mechanism .nevertheless , argument can be made that learning the ideas and concepts are the gradual steps of learning process and coming to facts .learning is a process where an individual has to go through certain steps to master the subject .understanding concepts and ideas leads to actual fact .subject can be learn in numerous way , if we just know the facts without understanding the actual concept and ideas behind it , it wouldnt master you in subject and knowledge would nt persist for a long .therefore , i personally advocate the process of understanding concepts and facts throughly before you come to actual fact .this way of learning will be efficient for students to learn the subject with a perfection .approaching the process of learning is this manner will get depth knowledge which may endure .
