young people are often said to mostly have themselves in mind .this thesis might arise from decreasing numbers of young people that are actively participating some sort of communities .but is this true ?in my opinion this theory is too simple and the topic needs to be viewed from several aspects .what kind of communities are we talking about ?churches , sects , clubs or online communities ?in case of the first two i believe it may be alright .young people would like to be free in mind and not spend their life being afraid of an evil lord who will smack them down unless they serve certain people .turning their backs to religion for me is the right choice .but on the contrary i believe that private and online communities are not lacking motivated and caring young people .a lot of communities have been formed - or should i say boomed ?- during the past few years .the word itsself is probably one of the most frequently used ones among young people .their active participation helps these communities and , as it is the idea behind it , it also helps themselves gathering social contacts exchanging information and opinions .but yes , some children certainly spend too much time playing video games or watching tv instead of making something that is more productive or creative .they waste their time they sit in front of their monitors seeking short-term satisfaction .of course they are wrong but their are not the ones that tell themselves what is right and what is wrong .they also will not find a way to communities themselves .it is their parents that are responsible for them so it is them that need to be harmed if young kids some day lack social skills .they determine where their children go , what media they are confronted with and what social activities their children are part of .but the parents are not solely responsible .teachers play a role and have to provide a kind of ethical education , too .to conclude i would like to say that this sentence is full of prejudice but maybe totally nonsense .it is true that society forces most people to take care of their own as there are less and less rewards given for sacial actions .
