i disagree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .facts have more verious phononems and interested for students to understand .it is more interesting to see the facts than just memorize the ideas and the concepts .people are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book .for example , in a chemistry class , if the teachers intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do ?they prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the students to image .it is the easiler way to show the process of the reaction , like the colors , sounds , smell .also , it has the variaty of the facts which can attract the students attention .if a teacher do not use the facts in class , the students maight feel tedious and boring to listen .at that time , they will move their attetion to another things .thay will cause bad effects to undetstand the knowledge .in conclusion , it is interesting to use facts more than memorize .it is also a good way to help the student to remember the mathod by prove it through the facts .sometimes people maight not understand what the teacher are talking about in class .they need a better inprovement to improve them understand .for example , the students may not understand what is the wave like .because of wave is not seen by people , it do not have the color , smelt and sound .at this time , if the teacher use a fact which is like put the method into a experiment .the teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like .that is why the facts have the better way to make the students understand .in conslusion , using more facts are not only interested but more easier to help the students to understand than just read ideas and concepts .
