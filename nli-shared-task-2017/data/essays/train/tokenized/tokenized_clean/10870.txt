i disagree with the opion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .although to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help people know different fields acknowledges , we only can know the surface knowledge about each subjects .so i prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject .to begin with , our time is limit .we can not study every subject well .we can not acquire the true knowledge and tecnical if we sperate our time into many subjects .for instance , if a students learned arts , psychology , math and drawing in his colledge life .i think he may know a lot of things .however it is difficult to him have a good mark in every fields .on the other hand , if we pay most of our time in one field .we can know a lot in this fields than others .for example , a student whose subject is psychology pay most of his time in the psychology .maybe he can know this field well .he can write papers about this fields and find job in this fields .in summary , i think it is better to have a specailize broad knowledge in one subject than to broad knowledge in many subjects .it is good for person and the whole society .
