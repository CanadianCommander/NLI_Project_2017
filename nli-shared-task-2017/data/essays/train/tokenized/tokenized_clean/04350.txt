the word knowledge is a verry big word , it has a lost of importance in aour daily lifes , and we are eforsing it since we start learning .knowledge is soetihing everybody have , in a diferent way but they got .it is very usfull to have a little bit of knowledge of everything .for my personal opinion it depends on what you want to focuse , because if you are good in one material .you shouk dedicate yourselve to that , but it is not bad to know a little bit of everything .what you rather to have a conversation with a person that for examples only talks to you about history , everything you talk with him will always tell you somthin of history or talks to a person that coul talk to you about everythin , what ever you ask him he will response you .people that will like to concentrate in one academy subject , it will be easier to them , the good think is that they will know it eveything a il be an exelent profesional .and knowledge could take ypu to become crazy just like einstein he was soo brilliant that turn up crazy .knowledge is the key for succces .and of corse you have to belve in your self and it could be one or a million of subject , you could have the best teachers of the world and if you do not cooperate you will be knowone .
