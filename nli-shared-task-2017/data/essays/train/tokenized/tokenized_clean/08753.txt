i like travel and i have been many different citys , counties .if the travel group have an amazing tour guide , it will be wonderful experiments .because maybe i can make many new friends during the trip , and learn about the history and knowledge of the place where we stay , and greatly my short life will highlight by the memrable trip .however , what is the best way to travel ?it could be great plans and cue guys or else other .and what kinds of tour guide is an amazing tour guide ?it is funny and rock question , 100 people must have 120 various anwear .we can not solve the problem to the rates , because the anwear is not we expecting and controling .if we want to have a best travel , firse we must make a completely plan , which contents the time we will spend and the place we will get and the money we have to prepare for .second , you will considerd the traveler with you .if you like travel alone , we have no many idea to discuss travel in a group .so , you have to considerd how many people in the group and decide wheter join in the group .in my opinion , the people in the travel group are my friends .we can give hands to others when he/she is in the trouble .we can work together , live together , share the beautiful views together and have some parts of memory together .actually , after preparing period , the people in the group can find each other s excellent point .and learn to others .finally , i belive it is a good way to travel that in a group had a good tour guide .it will be you , will be me .just we can make the travel to be a great experience .
