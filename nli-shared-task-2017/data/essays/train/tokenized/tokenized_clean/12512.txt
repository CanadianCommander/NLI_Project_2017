in our time , young people definitely have a real disrepute .they are thought to be violent , drug-addicted . ..all of them would tell you that cliches are completely wrong .do young people give enough time in their communities ?we will first see that some young people are completely out of their communities .on the contrary we will see that most of them seem to get involved in their society .that is true some young people are in a total disagreement with their community or society .that is why they do not want to be involved in other s life .so they stay with their only friends and live in a total different world than their parents and their relatives .but they are not examples for the whole  young people community  ...actually , most of them are really involved in other s life .and i can highlight lots of examples : in my highschool there are three or four groups [ of twenty people ] who organize some shows to get some funds to eventually help some destitute people who live in opalling conditions .i am able to cite another examples : in my girlfriend s school , people are giving money to the students to help them to organize a travel into the rwanda to lead this country to go back on a better way than ever [ education , food . .. ] .even if i live in a rich social class [ i am conscient about it ]i do not let the needy people in their dreadful conditions and lots of my friends share the same fancy of helping our community .that is why we spend a lot of time in doing a lot of things for our society as far as it is possible .to sum up there is no denying that some young people are completely cut from their society , torn apart angry and sadness .but most of young people are getting involved in their community to help others and why not the youngs ones who are not included in that community !
