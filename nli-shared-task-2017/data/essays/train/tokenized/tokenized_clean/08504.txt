the issue of is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than is it for them to learn facts is difficult to deal with because you can not understand abstract concepts without facts but on the other hand you can not understand facts without explaination .it remains that i think this is more importante to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts without understandness .to illustrate my point of view i am going to give three arguments with exemples .firtly , by understanding ideas and concepts you keep a criticise view on the world .we know that to the govern the france we need a president .this is a concept .after we can think about who could be the good one among peaple who would like to become president .secondly , this is evident that to understand how our world works , we need to learn general concepts and ideas .and after that we can do our own life in starting from this base .for exemple if you want to learn things at school , before you have to learn how to behave in a school and which are the rules of the school .finally , understand ideas and concepts suppose that you use your brain , you have think about these concepts and ideas .it choose that you are clever if you try to understand concept before learning example because this is the logical way of doing .at the opposite , there are people who learn supidly facts and example without understand anything .this kind of people are good at tv games but that all .they have not a critisize point of view on the world .we could even say that theses persons are dangerous for the society as they can as extremist feelings .to conclude , i would say that as i am a scientific this is logical for me to learn concepts .many people say that this is too abstract but i think this is the good way to understand the world : first concepts and them facts which support the concept .
