the topic of discussion today is whether it is good to travel in a group led by tour guide .i believe that travelling in a group accompanied by a tour guide is a better option for several reasons .travelling in a group with guide enables us to visit all the places of importance which we may otherwise miss .it gives us the opportunity to know about the place we are visiting in a better way than what we can do on our own .secondly historical places have certain history associated with them which we would never come to know if we do not have a travel guide .someone with appropriate knowledge can only guide us about the stories behind various momuments .suppose if we go visit taj mahal in india without a guide we would just be able to see a building and would not know what it specifies on the other hand if we are accompanied by a guide he would tell us the story behind the taj mahal which would make it more interesting and attractive .moreover travelling in group makes us enjoy more than what we can do alone and have better memories associated with certain events happened during the trip .we can have more people to share with what we are feeling and enjoy with .additionally travelling in group proves to be more cost efficient than travelling alone as the expenses are shared amongst the group and one individual is not overburdened with all the expenses .so we can conclude that travelling in group led by the tour guide is the better option for visiting places as it turns out to be more opportunistic and cost efficient morever we enjoy more when in group rather than alone .
