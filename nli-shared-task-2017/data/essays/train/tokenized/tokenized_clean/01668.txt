my grandfather was always said to me ; ?f you wanna swimm , then go to the occean rather than the pole .at that time i didnt understand what does it mean .but after many years , when i came in a big city and saw many succesfull people , i understood that ; curoisity , hardworking , good planning , and risk taking are common factors of succesfull people .at first sight , doing same things seem maybe easy , compfortable and safe .but after a while it ll be boring .and you fell yourself probably lonely and unuseful .on the otherhand ; if you are curios people , you ll decline to always try to find new things .that makes you happy and ensure you selfconfidence which is very important of success .but trying to find new things and curiostiy are not enough for success .you should also make a good plan and hardworking on it .finally risktaking .i think ?ts the most important thing for suceess .everybody can work hard and make a good plan .but too few people can take risks to implement in real life .
