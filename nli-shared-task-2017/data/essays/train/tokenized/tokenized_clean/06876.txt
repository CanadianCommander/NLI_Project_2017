it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn factsit is controversial to say that students should understand ideas and concepts than learnig facts .it is impotant for the students to understand the ideas and the concepts as well as to learn facts .understanding the ideas and the concepts is the first step of the knowledge .if the students do not understand or interprete the concepts , they can not learn the facts about the real matter .the students may take wrong path if they do not understand the concept or the ideas from the matter .it must be understood that working on an important thing is not easy .so , before the students take any action , they should understand the main ideas and the concepts from an appropriate matter .if they follow the first step , they may get good result , otherwise it may turn into a bad result .if the students understand the main ideas and the concepts , it is easy to learn the facts .then they may learn what exactly the matter is and mey get appropriate reason for the cause .for example , in a class room , the student is doing his research and he does not understand the concept and idea , he may produce a wrong work on what is given to him .once he understan the concept and the idea , it is very easy for him to lear the exact facts .once he understands the concept and idea , it is easy for him to produce the result on his research work .sum sum up , it is coinsided that when the student is working on a project or any other work , he has to undrestand the concepts and ideas as well as the facts .then it makes students life more easy .
