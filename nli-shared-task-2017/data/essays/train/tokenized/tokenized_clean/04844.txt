according to this topic , it is really a question whether using the broad mind in subject is the better way than specialize .due to their respective angles , different people hold different view .in my poinion , although the specialist in nowadays is important , the generalist is really the major part which can not be reduced .in the following discussion , i would like to provide the evidence to support my view on this topic .as the developing of the technology all over the world , things are changing with each passing day , the inventions always appears in the market , and we could fairly said that the specialist in the program is doing the great construction .they have deep mind in their own major , and would provide the worthless suggestions to the people , if without their suggestion , it might be hard for people to invent the novel things .although they do not have the wide knowledge of all the area , acturally the depth of the major they are specialized may not be touched by the generalist .and because of the depth , they could find out the useful imformations generalist could not find .to be honoest , if without them , just using the broad knowledge way , not all the inventions could come out so quickly .hence the specialist is really play an important role over the world .the specialist contributed to the society , does not mean the generalist is less useful .in the actual life , they just using their wide information to connect the major which they researched with the other areas , which is important to the research .if a major just have their way and not communicate with the others , they would just like the frog in the hole , which could not get the farther developed .and the generalist using their broad knowledge of many academic subjects to straighten the connect with the reference major , which would provide the researcher more spaces to think and to compensate the weakless , using this way , the technology is growing so fast and just this way can giving the sociey long development .from the above we can easily see that the specialist and generalist are all suficient to the society , either of which could not be missed .just using the whole imformation that they both summerized , the inventions would stable in the society , and meet the need of customers .if just having the specilist , the things is just adopted in the small area , which means it can not get the greatly developed .and also , just using the generalist s mind , the things are not deep stand in the society , which means the other products would easily over them in the short time .so the specialist and the generalist can not seperated .from the specilist , the generalist could get the details of the inventions , and from the generalist , the specialist would not just focus their eyesight in the tiny area , hence as the compensation they two get togher would take the novel developed to the technology .
