i am agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they are .i think that it is normal because the attendence of the people are always big .a good advertisement must make a product seem much better than it is for a commercial law .in fact in the commercial law the product must be presented like a better .if the advertisement give some positive sensation to the people , it is just a little step for make a good product .it is not important if in the advertisement there is a good or bad product .but it is important like the product is seemed .for example i want to buy a new car .i see an advertisement that make a car like a good product and i want to buy that car because i believe that it is a godd car .this is a little example but for everything we can make an advertisement make a product much better than it really is .the consumist world in that we live impose us this new ways of thinking .the people are joked to the adverstisement and then they are unbeliveable if the product is not like they think .when i was a child i wanted a little toys because in the advertisement was a new fantastic robots and all the child wanted it .but only with the passage of the age i learnt that not all advertisements tells a trouth .
