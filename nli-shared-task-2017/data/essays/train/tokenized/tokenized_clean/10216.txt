as the transportation system has developed , traveling became one form of enjoyment for people .they may enjoy traveling in a group led by a tour guide , or they may go in a group but without a tour guide .in my opinion , traveling in a group without a guide would be the best way to travel because it is cheaper , and more enjoyable .first of all , traveling with a group , but without a guide is cheaper .in one case , i have a experience of traveling with my family and a guide , and it made think that hiring a guide was a waste .when i went to tokyo , japan for traveling , the guide was with us all the time .our family had to pay her transportation bill , lunch , and dinner .however , if she were nt there , i could have ate more sushi .furthermore , on a newspaper , there is always a commercial about traveling abroad .while i was reading it , it said that traveling hawaii with a guide required three hundred dollors more than without the guide .for these reasons , since traveling with a guide costs more money , i prefer traveling without a guide .secondly , traveling without a guide is way more interesting .when there somebody who takes you everywhere that one does not have to open a map , it is meaningless .for example , when eugenie , a friend of mine , visited beijing with her friends without a guide , she could know more about beijing .she explained me where the great wall loacates and how to get there economically .by then , i realized that traveling without a guide is more exciting since one can learn more .morover , when i went to kyungjyu with my whole classmates and our homeroom teacher as a tour guide since she was born there , it was boring .my teacher wanted to go to historical places and explain us about them , while students wanted to go to amusement park and have more excitement .thus , traveling with a guide is never good .in conclusion , i strongly believe that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not great .my experinces of traveling japan , kyouju certain prove reasons for why .because traveling with out a guide is more economical and exciteing , i think it is excellent to travel only in a group of people who i know .
