i disagree with the statesment that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .first of all , huge numbers of people will buy their own car in twenty century .for example , thirty years ago , each family in japan can buy only one car .because it was too expensive and people in japan was not rich to buy many cars .when my parents were child , there was a only car for one family .thesedays , people in japan buy own car , so one family purchase two or tree cars .i think same things will be happen in idia or china in twenty years .more and more economy grow , more and more car will be purchased people .this example clearly show that huge numbers of people will buy their own car .second , technology development will give us more opportunity to ride a car .some people would say that we should not ride car because it has negative impact for our environment .some sity office in japan do not allow citizens to ride the car inside the central city .however , some car makers which has high technology already developed electric car .the cars developed by the company does not pollute the air .if erectric car is sold at same place with the car which we ride , many people would buy erectric cars .and goverment would encourage to buy erectric cars and ride those cars .this example demonstrates that technology develpoment will give us more opportunity to ride a car .threfore , i strongly disagree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
