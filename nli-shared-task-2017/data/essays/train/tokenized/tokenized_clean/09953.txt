i can not agree with this statement for the following reasons .first , the needs for community action should be assessed taking into account the evolution of society in general .for instance , a few decades ago , providing ressources to older people was a major part of community action .nowadays , older people have less need for this kind of material support ( development of pension plans in the ` 50s and 60  ) .they tend to be more independent then in the past .older people are more in need of social contacts and activities .i believe young people do their best to respond to these needs .second , the concept of community investment has changed .in the past , community action was viewed as some kind of obligation .people were helping the community only , or mainly , because of the moral pressure to do so .nowadays , of course the moral aspect of community action still exist , but it is not the main motive for people to get involved into such action .community investment has developped as an activity of its own , more like a social activity or a hobby .a good example of the way young people approach community action nowadays would be the projects developped on the campus of the university of louvain , where i studied : student would group themselves around a particular community action and live together in a flat .the help provided by these organizations typically include help to people with disabilities , amnesty international support , providing free basic legal advices etc .students involved in these projects basically spend most of the academic year to make sure the projects is efficient and achieves its goals .but they never see it as some burden .as a conclusionm i would say that young people do spend a great part of their time in helpimg their communities , but that the need for help and the concept of help has changed .
