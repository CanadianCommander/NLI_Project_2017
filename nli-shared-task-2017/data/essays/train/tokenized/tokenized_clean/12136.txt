i must say taht i am totally disagree with the statement given .ideas and concepts are fictional , created thoughts on specific questions .these are developed by someone and might be accepted as a fact in the society even not at the beginning .for example `` democracy  .in modern societies concept of democracy has created its own myht .we see democracy as an ideal which all people should respect its institutions and live according to its rules .in our eyes democracy is universal .however , only 64 years ago , in the heart of europe a man raised his voice against the democracy and millions followed him despite his brutulness paved the way for a war massacered millions who followed him and other millions from different nations .the reasonne behind this is the ignorance of the facts of german people devoting themselves to the ideas and concepts of race superiority , dictatorship and fuhrer .under the brutal regime of hitler junta , they not only ignored what happened to their neighbours but told their children to do so also .hitler was successful because he could play with the ideas and concepts as he liked .what i mean is as the ideas concepts are the products of whether an individual or a society they may not reflect the rights or the facts everytime .they show most of the time what the bulk of people think , but these thoughts might have nothing to do with the facts .a solid education system must be based on the facts as well as ideas and concepts .if we do not give the chance students to learn facts and the concepts and ideas built on them one part of the education will always be missed .i remember when i was at school of law .roman law was one of the toughest of the lessons , especially the relations in the families .as a concept roman law , in my opinion , alone can not explain the fictitious relations between for example bride and her father in-law .in ancient rome when brides come to his husbands family , she is accepted not as a bride , but however as the daughter of the patria familias .to understand the reasons we must look at the facts provided us by history and sociology .to sum up , my own experiences has shown me that learning of the ideas and concepts must walk in hand with the facts in education system .otherwise easily misguided by wrong ideas , students might not find what the real world is .
