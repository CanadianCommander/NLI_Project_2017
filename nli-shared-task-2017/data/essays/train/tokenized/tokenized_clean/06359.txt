i t very important for the education systems to theach qualified and students but a conflict will occur when a teacher choose her/him teacing tools .it is the war between theory , understant the ideas and concepts , and practical information , learning facts .if i have to support one side of this war , my preference will be the learning facts .there are a lot of reasons to be agree with the supporters of importance og learning facts , learning with the practical information and experience .if a student knows how to use her/his new idea and concept in the real world , he/she will learn and apply quickly in to the real life .because it is very convenient and excited for the students to use new ideas and concepts .i have a spesific experience for this , i had two chemical teachers when i was at the high school .one of my teacher were giving us experimentalm assignments as a homework and do the experiment in the school also so i can easiliy remember what we did durung that semester but my chemical theacher will retired and other new theacher came to teach us for the previous season , she just gave formulas and features of the elements but i can not imagine anything i completely fotgot the everything what she discuss .i suppose as time passing my second unexperinced teacher was changed and saw the power of the practical information .
