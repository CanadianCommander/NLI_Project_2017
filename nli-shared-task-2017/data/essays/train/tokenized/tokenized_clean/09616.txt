i agree with the statement .to me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because societies which create a new product trick people who believe in their lies , so the entire population depends on advertisements which shows `` incredible products  which can resolve many different problems , such as how to clean up houses or cars at best with a new soap which erases any stain , or how to repair a part of the furniture ; in reality many of the effects of the products are created using a modern computer program .in this way people believe in something which partially does not exist and waste much money .for example , one year ago i bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoes and clothes : i used it only 2 times and then it did nt work anymore : now i still regret buying it ( but the product presented in the tv advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one ) .the philosopher karl marx , in the 19th century , said this :  ...the religion is the oppium of all populations . ..: to me this expression may be changed in this new form :  ...advertisements are the oppium of people ...  , and it s really related to the today s situation .
