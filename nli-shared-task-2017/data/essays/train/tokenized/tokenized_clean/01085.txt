in todays society both young and older people enjoy life , but being spicific young people do enjoy more than older people .the energy level in young people to enjoy life is way to much than the older people .the life of young people is filled with fun and frollic as they have their study time along with their party time .young people have much more capacity and streangth than older people to enjoy life and also the younger generation in todays world is fully pampered by the older generation .young people enjoy life more as they have much lesser tention than the older people .older people have a lot of responsibilities as they have to earn profits in order to give all the neccesities to their family which young people do not have to do .older people have too many tensions and are therefore stressed .it can be related to their business or job or in other words it can be related to any context .on the other hand the young people are stress free .the younger generation in todays world is much smarter and alert than the older generation as they can handle and perform jobs more efficiently .the younger generation enjoys life way more than the older generation as they are stress free .having more fun for the younger people is true as there are more and more birthday parties and other invites for our relaxed younger generation .the young has no worries about the business as they have elder people in the family to do so .therefore there are much less problems in a youngsters life than in a old persons life .i conclude myself by underlining that the younger generation of todays world enjoys life more than the older generation in every aspect and this senario will continue for a long period of time .
