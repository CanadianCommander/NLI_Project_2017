i feel that i do nt agree with this statement .first , the number of developing country is much larger than the number of developed country in the earth .mang people in developing country wil be richer and richer .so they will buy their own cars in the furture .j ust like china .because i am from china , i know much more about the people in developing country .in china , the economy is much better than twenty years ago .the number of cars is creased so fast in these years .more and more people are talking about the plan of buying a new car now .it has already been an important part in people s life .second , in my opinion , the number of cars in developed is full now .almost everybody has their own car , and some people even have two .but it do not means that the number will decrease .in twenty years , people will update their cars more morden .but do not reduce the number of cars .so it will lead that the number is no changed obviously .third , although mang country s government begin to limit the number of cars because of the pollution .but i believe that the producers of car can find another way to avoid its happen .they can find out another energy to instead of oil .just like gas , electricity , and so on .maybe there will be more and more cars using this kind of energy in the roads .i think this is also our dream .finaly , producing a car can improve the technology in many fields .we have no rights to stops it .having a beautiful car is also my dream .
