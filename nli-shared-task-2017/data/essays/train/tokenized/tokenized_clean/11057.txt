i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .but it s also important to know facts .bacause every idea and concept still requires basic facts which are necessary to really understand them .you have to decline two kind of facts : facts which are basic knwoledge and facts which are only important if you want to handle it deeply .many of today s students learn facts , but they do nt really understand it .and so it is better for students and for life preparation to understand ideas and concepts than only to know facts .for example : if you know how something work you must not know why it works .many students learn strictly all details of an idea but they do nt realize the whole .in many subjects you have to learn by hard to get all details , but it is better to understand the concept which allows students to study , recognizing and solving problems which are still different but mainly the same basic .but students should know and learn facts , too .because in todaz s life every problem must be analized and its solution must founded on especially facts .to solve a problem without detailed facts is very unprofessional kind of working .other persons with ground knwoledge should be able to find failures in your documentation .learning must consist out of both : founded knowledge compared with ideas and concepts .ideas and concepts may include facts which are neccesary to understand them .many students know and learn only as much as needed to pass an exam or anzthing else .this might be good for the moment but you ca nt pass life very well .a reason for this could be also a problem of teaching skills .all in all it must be important for every student to reach a founded education with both : detail knowledge and basic ideas .
