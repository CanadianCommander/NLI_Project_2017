i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in the shcool , teachers always instruct about the truth that students must know at least to become the adult and to go to the society .however , some subjects which taken in the school is in vain .and they also limited the children s identication .first , understanding ideas and concepts gives students to creativity that they can even think and imagine well for their world .if sutdents did not understand ideas and concepts of any subjects they will fail that class because they got confused what thecher said .also giving the facts must be really boring that they would never try to think about the future .second , when students become the adult and working in anywhere , they will work well with their frexible brain which makes the final good dicision what they must do .
