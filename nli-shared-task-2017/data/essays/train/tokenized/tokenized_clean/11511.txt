there is an old saying , `` do not judge a book by its cover  .it is true and applies to everything and everywhere in the world .it is impossible to see what the content of the box is only by looking at a box unless a person has an uncanny ability to do so .a woman with luxurious clothes eating in an expensive restaurant might not be rich because she might have borrowed the clothes from her friend for a day and somebody else was paying for her food .same as the advertisements .since the purpose of the advertisement is to sell products , it is inevitable to describle products better than they really are .every product is covered with some descriptions and pictures on it .in most cases , the pictures are not exactly same as the real content .for example , one day , i went to the store to buy something to eat .every food looked great to me since i was hungry , and the pictures on the covers looked really delicious .i bought a bunch of instant food and tried one of them at home .i put frozen pasta in a microwave , and when i took it out from the microwave to eat , i was greatly disappointed and frustrated .although the picture on its cover had big chunks of meats and creamy sauce on softly boiled noodles , the actual food looked totally different from the picuture .from this example , it can be concluded that it is necessary for food companies or advertisement companies to make advertisement with exaggreational expression or pictures to sell them .i bought the frozen pasta since its advertisement looked great .if there were two kinds of frozen pasta with two different covers with the frozen pasta and the other one with deliciously cooked pasta , what would people prefer to buy ?
