there are some advantages in beeing versed regarding a specific subject as well as having knowledge about a variety of subjects .it is very common today that people occupy only a small vatriety of subjects .such people are called isle - people in germany .this means that people do only very well , when they work in their special subject .to my mind this is one of the most frighten development in german economics as well as in german society .as far as i can see , the human beeing is such a complex construct that must be challengend often .people should be flexible regarding different subjects to maintain the individual skills and characteristics which make them unique .i try to get knowledge of a variety of subjects , for example : medicine and english , but also sports , music and photography .it is a big advantage , for instance when you live by your own , like i do .let me explain .when i moved into my own appartment i was able to paint the rooms by myself and to drive the lorry for my cargo by myself .therefore i saved a lot of money by avoiding plumbers or any other speical workers .in reference to the job situation in my country it is also very important to have a wide variety of knowledege and to be , moreover flexible .of course some vacancies in germany require a lot of different skills .because i do nt want to become unemployed one time ; i tried maintain , or precisely enhance my knowledge .a person versed in only one subject can only work in this category of jobs .it is the only thing you can influence to get a job in different spaces of business .so why do nt you do so ?finallly i draw the conclusion that wide knowledge is not only necessary regarding profession , but moreover regarding your private life .one reason is , that the life itself requires also a lot of different skills , like beeing friendly , lovefull or even to be organized in reference to the household .
