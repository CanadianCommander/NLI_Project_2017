many people prefer to travel in groups led by a tour guide , and other people prefer to travel individually .there are many advanatges for both methods that i have to take in consideration when i plan to travel and especially when i plan to make a touristic tour to a certain country .on one hand when i travel with a group led by a tour guide , i am limited with the place indicated by the tour guide .however , if i travel individually i can make my own plans and i can go any where i want to visit .moreover , i am not only limited with the places but also with the time that the tour guide indicate to stay in one place .if i travel individually , i can spend more time in one place that i like more than other place .on the other hand , travelling with a group led by a tour guide will be more organized .therefore , regarding the schedule of the trip , the tour guide will make a plan in order to visit the maximum number of places in the country .however , if i am alone , i might miss some important places to visit .also , the tour guide might provide me lot of information about any touristic site , while i can not get these information from any other sources during the trip .in the meantime , during a trip with a group .i might take advantage of making some relationships and making some friends .furthermore , it will be a good opportunity to interact with people from different nationalities and different cultures .so i will be able to practice my languages with them and we might go out and have fun together during the free time .however , if i travel alone , it will be a good chance to relax and have some silent moments with myself .sometimes , i need calm after long period of working hard .for example , i will choose to spend some times on the beach , looking at the sea and enjoy the sound of the waves and the weather , this is a relieve for my stress .giving the advantages of boyh methods , i belive that when i go for a trip , i should organize the time in such a way that during some days i have to join a group with a tour guide and some days i will need to stay alone .therefore , i will get double benefit from my trip : relaxing and expanding my knowledge about the country i visit .
