we always heard that the young people are too lazy , that they spend too much time im front of their computer screens , chatting or playing video gamesand that they always refuse to work at home ai think those who said these words must have a look to all the activities the young people do to help the community before having such as this opinion .the first thing we should notice is that the youth is the synonym of art , creativity and imagination .most of the teenagers are interested in urban art , music or at least cinema .when they go outside to the cinema or to a concert , they are directly involved in the artistic life .a lot of teenagers play a music instrument , sing or play theater .it s an efficient way to devellop art , to improve the artistic production .for instance , walls graffittis were considered few decades ago such as a teenager s occupation without any artistic value .however , they are considered nowadays like real artistic paintings of this original urban art .rqp music music was considered also as a  bad  music but it becomes nowadays a real art .in fact , we can see that the young people helped their communities to improve their qrtistic skills and to create new ones .in other words , they do nt lose their time whem they are listening to their own type of music or when they are drawing their specific draws .besides , we can add that the young help the society to improve its organization because they are the first one s who react when something wrong happen .if the government takes decisions which go against the citizens , youth will be the first one who will be on strike to defend all the citizens rights and the values that they believe in .for instance , when the french governement took a decision which made workers  situation more impredictable , the young student went out in the street to demonstraste that this law went again their values .this example shows that the young take time to defend the rights of the community whem they see that the society is in danger .finally , we can see that young people denfnd their rights and devellop the artistic activity .they are not as lazy as is generally said .
