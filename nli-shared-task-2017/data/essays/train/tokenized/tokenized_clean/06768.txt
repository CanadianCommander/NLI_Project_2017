i do agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are  .we all have a great infuence on all these advertising items .there are many means of advertising like the television , newspaper , ads on roads and many more .so , every one gets an opportinuity to see one or the other .one example or the reason why i agree with this statement is that , once i brought a cream which says it removes all the blemishes and left over marks in just few days .the advertisement was soo well that i was just impressed by just seeing it one time .and it was just not more then a moisturizer , which just did nothing which it had to do , but made my skin so oily .one more example is that once i brought a solution which says that removes all the dirt in the craks of the legs , and make them smooth , but it removes the dirt by not only removing only the dirt but also removing layes of skin .i was just shoked and even scared of using new products from that time .these are not only the examples but they are many more , just take the car insurance company , it says too much but never does all that it says , by saying many rules and conditions for all the instrutions it gave .we can have one mare example like the calling card it says , which says the voice would be very much clear with so many minutes . .and many more .but what we get truely is thatonly the minutes to talk which are are really not worth or useful with out a clear voice .we can take one more example like the alarms which we use for safety purposes by getting impressed by seeing the advertisements , it do works as it says , but is it taht useful as we heard from that advertisement , we need to just think of that .there are many more like the clothes , gold , food , restaurents , fast food centers , and many more , whch are just differnt from what is said in the advertisements .these are few of the reasons which makes me agree with the above statement .
