personally , i totally agree with that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .first of all , in fact , no matter closely or less closely , every subject is interrelated with each other .we need broad knowledge of many academic subjects even we are majoring in a specific subject .if we focus on one thing , failing to possess a wide span of knowledge of related subjects , we are even unable to be excellent in this given field .for example , if we study physics , of course , we need to pay much attention on our physics books and remember all the complex rules .but that is not all !we need other kinds of knowledge to help us doing the physics studies .we need to know about computer , which will help us with our researches ; we may need to know about english , in order to visit the foreign websites to see the latest developments in physics all over the world ; we may also need to know about lecturing , in order to spread our ideas or new discoveries .second , without the broad knowledge of many academic subject , we are unlikely to live an enjoyable life in today s changing and integrited world .nowadays , the world has become more and more mixed , no matter in geographical sense or in cultural and academical sense .we make friends with people from all over the world and we are no longer refrained within our little circles .our friends may be just specialized in totally different subjects or fields .it is just unrealistic if we remain only familiar with solely one kind of knowledge .so , in order to communicate with all kinds of friends and to boost interpersonal relationship , we must broaden our scope of knowledge .only by doing this could it be possible for us to lead an enjoyable and rewarding life in today s world .so , in a word , i think that it is high time we stressed on the importance of accumulating knowledge of many academic subjects .
