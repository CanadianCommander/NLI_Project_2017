1,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",This is important because makes us know what students are actually interested in .
2,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Piefer it is better to specialise in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics .
3,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",First reason to support my statement is that when we concentrate on many academic subjects we could not concentrate well on all of the subjects .
4,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",And we can not do well in all the subjects .
5,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",when you take one specific subject and specialise on it you could concentrate well on the subject and can do justification to the subject .
6,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",for this reason I think my choice is superior .

9,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",By researching on the subject you can discover many new things in that subject .

13,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",so it is better to specialise in one subject in which he has interest instead of learning all the subjects .

950,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",There are several reasons why I think so .
951,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The first is that the costs to drive and possess a car would be much higher than today .
952,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Because the price oil would get higher .

955,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",So not every person will have the money to use a car .
956,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Another reason why cars will be get fewer is that there will be a lot of other options to come from point A to point B in the future .
957,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",For example a transrapid will be built in munich in the next years .
958,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",So many people would not use a car if they have the possibility to go by the transrapid .
959,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",And today many people research for new ways of transport people that are not as bad for the environment as cars are .

962,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",And in big city you normally do n't need a car .
963,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",I think so because with the car you need su longer than if you user other possibility because there a many traffic jams in bigger city .
