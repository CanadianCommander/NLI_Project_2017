2,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",the main reasons for this is nowadays every country and every place on the earth is polluted with harmful gases produced by the cars and other vehicles . .
3,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",and this gases can cause lot of damage to to the world . .
4,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",so this can damage the environment .
5,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",so reductions of cars are necessary to reduce the pollution and if we want to live in this homely planet we have to reduce the cars so by reducing the pollution . .
6,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",and the other thing is that all countries are reducing the production of harmful cars in this world .
7,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Another reason is that the will be less cars than now is .

12,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",so they strongly feel that cars can damage the world conditions a lot .
