1889,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The first one is that people trying to explore new things most of the time give a different point of view to all the other .
1890,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","For example , when Einstein has introduced his theory of relativity he has become one of the most appreciated scientists of the world ."

1892,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The second reason is that who tries new things is in general a very particular person and in many occasions I feel like them .

1896,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",I hope that in the future I will do something by which I will remembered as a successful person .
1897,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
1898,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The main reason of making products seem much better than they really are is achieving maximum profit out of selling the biggest amount possible through putting an over rated image of your product in your consumers ' mind .
1899,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Companies make their products seem much better than they really are to an extent that they create an illusion in the consumer 's mind by playing on his emotions and feelings .

1902,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Many advertisements give their products an over rated image which obliges other companies to give their product an over rated image or else their product will be considered weak among the other over rated products .
1903,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Although some advertisements do not make their products seem much better than they really are but most of the advertisement do .
1904,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",According to me successful people always go for the new things instead of going for the things that are well known .
1905,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",They will consider the ideas of the known things and try to go in a new way .
1906,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",So i agree with the sentence that successful people take risks for getting things to be done .
1907,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Suppose if we go for a well known matter there will be no chance of taking risk .
1908,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",We know what the result is going to be .
1909,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",We are not taking the risk in that where as if take the risk and obtain the thing or work done it will be satisfactory for us also .
1910,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",When i was in school my friends use to read only one publication where as i used to read three publications .

1914,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",But when i was preparing for the examinations my friends told me that i am going to fail the test and they asked me to read only the prescribed textbook instead of going for other books .
1915,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",But i know that i am going to score high in the class .
1916,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",I took risk and i was successful at the end .
1917,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",But one thing we have to keep in mind is that we should be careful while we are taking the risk .
1918,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",We should work hard for getting the desired results .
1919,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",Most of the successful world famous scientists also took risk and obtained fruitful result .

1921,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",So most of the successful business persons and other people who are successful in life will take some risks to achieve the good results .

1923,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",So its better to take risk in a proper manner and obtain the good results .
1924,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Personally I agree with the statement that in twenty years there definitely will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
