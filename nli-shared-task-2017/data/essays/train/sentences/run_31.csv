1042,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",I would totally agree that most advertisements make items appear much attractive than they really are .
1043,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",The most important reason is that marketing makes use of or subconscious feelings and desires .
1044,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Another reason is that products show just convenient aspects of a product rather than a natural mix of disadvantages and advandateges .
1045,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",First of all the success of a product is determined bz its advertisement .

1047,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",But when the marketing section begins the product develops to a subject which incorporates a specific feeling or soul .
1048,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Let me explain this examplatorily .
1049,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",When for instance Nike tries to sell some new shoes the are firstly nothing than shoes .
1050,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",And what makes them different from other shoes ?
1051,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",And how are people able to distinguish them from others ?
1052,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",The company which advertises the product tries to arouse a awareness of a specific group in society like e.g. young basketball players .
1053,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",The advertiser try to give their product a soul or feeling which automatically rises in a person who sees this product in the media .
1054,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",Thus the advertisers attempt to render their customers an opportunity for identification with their product .
1055,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",In this case we can imagine a young Boz sitting in front of his TV and watching this new ad and feeling the same as the people in the ad feel .
1056,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","So , it is possible that whenever he gets this feeling he remembers those Nike shoes he saw last time on TV ."

1059,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",I think that this depicts that we are somehow controled by the ads and the media .
1060,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]",And this is really scaring me that I 'm unconciously doing things I would n't do under normal circumstances .
