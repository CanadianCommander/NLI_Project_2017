1529,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",This is because they do not think that giving their time to helping their communities are their duties or obligations .

1532,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The young people today is busier than those of the past .
1533,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",The business world today is very rapid and young people today in such world are required to spend almost their all time for doing their own business .

1538,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",An example for such advertisement is about cars .
1539,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Often you can see cars in tv which roll over a only street in a beautiful countryside with a hawk on sky .

1543,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",In most advertisement persons who smoke cigarettes are cool ( like at `` Malborocountry '' ) and have much friends and social contacts .
1544,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",This makes you believe if you smook you will have friends .

1546,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",Also other kinds of advertisement are really problems for some groups of persons .

1548,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",So the advertisement can effect some familyproblems .
1549,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",And I think it is not necessary to say that this toys are not that good in the eyes of your children i played with it for some time .

1552,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",An example for this is milk .

1555,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",I donor agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .

1557,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]",It is true that the life syle of man has changed drastically over a period of time and man has to compete against time to go on .
