1,"[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",But I also think that it is normal and I 'm going to explain why .

6,"[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",And you will never see a perfume presented by a normal man or woman but by one or several top models .

12,"[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",So I will conclude saying that advertising enhance the image of the products and it is better like that .

20,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",so there will be enough fuel for the cars in next twenty years .
